==Description==
"You wish for me to become your deity?"<br>
The [[Orobashi|giant white snake]] gazed down at the child standing before him.<br>
"It was because I could best neither [[Morax|Deus Auri]] nor [[Electro Archon|Narukami]] that I elected to flee into waters unknown."<br>
"If you keep seeking the light, you will experience loss in the future."<br>
"My life is worth nothing. I've had enough of it all &mdash; of eking out this existence, of being shamed for blasphemy."

The giant serpent then showed forth a jewel that glimmered like snake-eyes.<br>
"In that case, swear it upon this eye."<br>
"This was also how I made a pact with my coral servants."

"Have you forgotten Master [[Supada no Hiko|Spartacus]]' teachings?"<br>
"We must never worship a god! We can only rely on ourselves!"<br>
The white serpent said nothing, for it respected the will of the people dwelling in the depths.<br>
If vain worship was supplanted by new belief,<br>
Then would it not dishonor those who fought?

"I'll swear it. I'll swear it here, before this eye."<br>
"All is as it was when I lost everything."

"The years have passed swiftly. The island is complete. The [[Bathysmal Vishaps|vishaps]] are repelled, and the Holy Soil may now be governed."<br>
"[[Sangonomiya Clan|House of Sangonomiya]], gathered [[Jibashiri]], and my vassals &mdash; the oath sworn upon the eye has come to fruition."<br>
"From today, if two or more parties should be dissatisfied with the arrangement concerning Enkanomiya, or should you decide otherwise than you first did,"<br>
"May the tower of the sun hear your wishes and collapse of its own accord, destroying all that was once your past."

Saying these final words,<br>
The serpent god took the remaining people to the surface.<br>
It was time to fulfill his oath to the [[Celestia|heavenly city]]...
