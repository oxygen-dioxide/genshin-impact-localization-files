==Description==
"You wish for me to become your deity?"<br />
The [[Orobashi|giant white snake]] gazed down at the child standing before him.<br />
"It was because I could best neither the [[Morax|golden god]]<ref group="Note">The original Chinese text calls this god the {{lang|mini=1|zh=贵金之神|zh_tl=God of Expensive Gold.}} {{lang|mini=1|zh=贵金}} is normally used in the word {{lang|mini=1|zh={{w|zh:贵金属|贵金属}}|zh_tl=precious metals}}, which refers to metals which have historically been used as coinage metals, particularly gold or silver. As the origin of Mora, which is often likened to gold, Morax is a likely candidate for the golden god.</ref> nor [[Electro Archon|Narukami]] that I elected to flee into waters unknown."<br />
"If you keep seeking the light, you will experience loss in the future."<br />
"My life is worth nothing. I've had enough of it all — of eking out this existence, of being shamed for blasphemy."

The giant serpent then showed forth a jewel that glimmered like snake-eyes.<br />
"In that case, swear it upon this eye."<br />
"This was also how I made a pact with my coral servants."

"Have you forgotten Master [[Supada no Hiko|Spartacus]]' teachings?"<br />
"We must never worship a god! We can only rely on ourselves!"<br />
The white serpent said nothing, for it respected the will of the people dwelling in the depths.<br />
If vain worship was supplanted by new belief,<br />
Then would it not dishonor those who fought?

"I'll swear it. I'll swear it here, before this eye."<br />
"All is as it was when I lost everything."

"The years have passed swiftly. The island is complete. The [[Bathysmal Vishaps|vishaps]] are repelled, and the Holy Soil may now be governed."<br />
"[[Sangonomiya Clan|House of Sangonomiya]], gathered [[Jibashiri]], and my vassals — the oath sworn upon the eye has come to fruition."<br />
"From today, if two or more parties should be dissatisfied with the arrangement concerning Enkanomiya, or should you decide otherwise than you first did,"<br />
"May the tower of the sun hear your wishes and collapse of its own accord, destroying all that was once your past."

Saying these final words,<br />
The serpent god took the remaining people to the surface.<br />
It was time to fulfill his oath to the [[Celestia|heavenly city]]...
