:'''Wakea Nui:''' Travel information here! Inquiries welcome!
:{{DIcon}} Hello there. And you are...
::'''Wakea Nui:''' Haha, not to brag or anything, but I'm probably the most responsible and reliable tour guide in the entire tribe!
::'''Wakea Nui:''' I'll provide you with the best vacation plan, and stay on your beck and call, always available to get you through any issues you may encounter during your stay here!
::'''Wakea Nui:''' I've got every kind of connection within the tribe, so if you need anything here, I've got you covered.
::{{DIcon}} So, what have you got around here?
::'''Wakea Nui:''' Travelers from distant lands can first have a taste of the local cuisine, before enjoying a live music performance and checking out the exquisitely-made records.
::'''Wakea Nui:''' Once you've recovered from that, you can try out all the water sports we have to offer, and have a jolly good time.
::'''Wakea Nui:''' If your arms and legs are sore, just have a good soak in the hot springs, and you'll be back up in no time.
::'''Wakea Nui:''' Come evening, visit the [[Golden Dusk]] to watch the sunset and have a nice, iced drink, and that'll be the perfect way to wrap up your day.
::{{DIcon}} Well arranged. I'm impressed.
::'''Wakea Nui:''' Haha, it's the least I can do. Every visitor to our land should get to experience everything we have to offer!
::'''Wakea Nui:''' So, how about it? Interested in the stuff I mentioned? I'll even book everything for you. All you need to do is show up and enjoy.
::'''Wakea Nui:''' Oh, and please feel free to bring your friends! The more the merrier!
:{{DIcon}} See you!
::'''Wakea Nui:''' Ah, leaving already? Well don't forget to come find me if you ever need a tour guide!

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wakea Nui:''' [[Kupo Nui|Mom]]... For all these years, have you really never felt the need to bring everyone together to expand the family business?
:'''Kupo Nui:''' Hmm? Why would you ask something like that, my child? Everyone in the family is gainfully employed. Won't you say that they're all hard at work in their own individual spheres?
:'''Wakea Nui:''' That's exactly what I mean! Instead of each focusing on our own thing, why can't we bring everyone together, so we can all work towards the same goal, and help each other grow?
:'''Kupo Nui:''' Ahh, I see. Well, if that's how you feel, why not bring it up with the group?
:'''Wakea Nui:''' *sigh*... But none of them are willing to give me the time of day. It feels like they're all happy to just stick to the status quo...
:'''Kupo Nui:''' Ah, is that so? Then you should also be happy for them.
:'''Wakea Nui:''' I can be happy for them, I guess, but I'm a little sad for myself. At this rate, I'll never get a second employee for my international travel agency...
