{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Go to Poisson)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Adele, we're back! We brought you a gift from the Court, too.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 adele 01.ogg}} '''Adele:''' Whoa, thank you so much, Boss!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 coralie 01.ogg}} '''Coralie:''' Don't call her "Boss," okay, Adele? Just "Miss Navia" would be fine.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha, it's alright, I don't mind. Besides the gift, I've also got another surprise &mdash; guess who's here?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's been a while!
:{{DIcon}} Hello again.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 coralie 02.ogg}} '''Coralie:''' Oh, it's you two! It has been a while indeed. Thank you so much for your help on Jacques' case.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 coralie 03.ogg}} '''Coralie:''' I've heard that you also helped save all of Fontaine. You're truly just like the great heroes of legend.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 adele 02.ogg}} '''Adele:''' You're really amazing, and if Miss Navia's your friend, then she must be super amazing too!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 adele 03.ogg}} '''Adele:''' What's in this thing? Can I look?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course, go ahead!
:[[File:Yesterday's Tears, Tomorrow's Light Uniform Item.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 adele 04.ogg}} '''Adele:''' Oh, it's... a Spina di Rosula uniform! Is it for me? But... Isn't it a bit big?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's a gift for future you. When you first told me that you were interested in joining the Spina, I was overjoyed.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But it's the Spina's responsibility to protect everyone as well. Being a member means becoming involved in all kinds of dangerous situations, and since you're still young, I don't want your mom to have to worry about your safety.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So I turned you down then by telling you that you'll have to wait until you're older. But this uniform is a promise that you can join us once you're old enough to wear it!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 adele 05.ogg}} '''Adele:''' Ooh, so that's it! Well, thank you so much, Miss Navia! I'll work hard and grow up as fast as I can.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 01.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Haha, but you can't really grow up faster by working hard. You've got to be patient.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 coralie 04.ogg}} '''Coralie:''' Everyone... I'm really grateful that you remembered my daughter's wish, and took it seriously.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 coralie 05.ogg}} '''Coralie:''' Thanks to the protection of the Spina, even though her father's no longer with us, we've still felt plenty of warmth and security.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's the least we could do. As long as you live in Poisson, even if you're not an official member, you're still part of the family.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 01.ogg}} '''Florent:''' B&mdash;Boss!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh? Is something up, Florent?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 02.ogg}} '''Florent:''' I've got something urgent to report! Romeuf and his folks have gathered outside Poisson, and even shipped in a huge pile of explosives!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What!? Explosives? What do they want?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 03.ogg}} '''Florent:''' It seems like they've been planning this for some time. We started investigating as soon as we received your letter yesterday.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 04.ogg}} '''Florent:''' But Romeuf and his folks must have gotten wind as well, because they abandoned their former posts before we could even check on them.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 05.ogg}} '''Florent:''' We investigated their tracks, and found out that they're after Poisson!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could they have smartened up since we caught them red-handed at the Court?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 02.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Seems like they've got no interest in sitting down and talking at all. We should have gone straight to the Maison Gardiennage.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Sorry, I underestimated the situation. Well, too late now, I suppose. Florent, where are they keeping their explosives?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 06.ogg}} '''Florent:''' On the hill to the east of Poisson, near the Clementine Line...
:{{DIcon}} Wait, could that mean...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' They want to blow up the Clementine Line!?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 03.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Certainly sounds like it...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Romeuf and his followers hate the Spina and everything to do with Callas &mdash; and the aquabus was the source of their contention.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If they manage to blow up the aquabus line, all that rubble will come crashing down the hill and straight into Poisson!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are they insane? There are tons of innocent people in Poisson!
:{{DIcon}} We have to stop them.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yeah, if they've been planning this for ages, they're definitely not going to let this opportunity slip by.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We have to issue an evacuation order to the townspeople, and get them as far away from the entrance as possible. That should save them from the worst of it...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 07.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Let's get everyone onto our ship. That should be the safest place.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' My dear partner, can I leave the Clementine Line to you?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If the explosives do go off, not only would the people of Poisson be in danger, any aquabuses using the line would plummet to the ground.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Let's stop their insanity first, then settle the score with them!
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Leave it to us, Navia! Please stay safe, too!
:{{Color|menu|You and Paimon leave and head to the entrance of Poisson.}}

:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Let's go, you two! We've got to act fast. Ms. Coralie, please take Adele to the ship...
:{{Color|menu|Colter takes advantage of Navia's lowered guard and lunges at her with his weapon drawn.}}
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 08.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Watch out, Boss!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 04.ogg}} '''Colter:''' ...!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 09.ogg}} '''Florent:''' What do you think you're doing, Colter!?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 05.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Tch. I thought all the annoying little hindrances had left, but I still couldn't get rid of you.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You mean... This was all a trick so that you'd be left alone with me? Colter, are you with Romeuf too?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I get it now. You knew about their plans all along. You only told us they were doing badly so that we'd drop our guard...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 06.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Not quite. Though I share their positions on some issues, I've never cared for his more radical ideas.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 07.ogg}} '''Colter:''' And that's because... Out of the entire Spina di Rosula, I only hate you! Only you, Navia!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 10.ogg}} '''Florent:''' You'd better stay close to me.
:{{Color|menu|Florent speaks and shields Coralie and Adele at the same time.}}
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 08.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Romeuf promised me that he would leave Poisson alone if I could just take you out.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 09.ogg}} '''Colter:''' But it was like you were glued at the hip to that pesky Traveler. You never gave me a chance to make my move...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 10.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Romeuf has lost his patience. I didn't have to be here today, you know, but I swore that I'd kill you, even if it meant being buried with you in the rubble.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Why?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 11.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Only someone as clueless about the past as you would ask such a foolish question.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 12.ogg}} '''Colter:''' You never saw the heyday of Spina di Rosula, nor did you ever live through the golden age of Poisson.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 13.ogg}} '''Colter:''' But I... I saw it all, with my own eyes! And then I had to watch it all die, little by little!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 14.ogg}} '''Colter:''' And it was all because of you, Navia.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 15.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Clementine died because of you, Callas died because of you, Melus and Silver died because of you... and so many more, dead! Everyone dead, all because of you!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 11.ogg}} '''Florent:''' So the shock and grief you showed us before... That was an act, too.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 16.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Now you're catching on! I heard Melus was dead the moment I got out.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 17.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Did you know? Down there in that blasted Fortress, I spent a long time thinking about what happened, and resolving to apologize to Melus as soon as I got out.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 18.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Back then, because of that aquabus, we had a huge fallout. I was convinced that all he cared about was loyalty, and that he had completely lost his capacity for critical thinking.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 19.ogg}} '''Colter:''' The years passed by in a blur after that. I thought I had finally begun to understand him, and that he could help me relive the good old days again...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 20.ogg}} '''Colter:''' But then, he died! And it was because of you again, Navia. It's always because of you!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 21.ogg}} '''Colter:''' I once loved the Spina and Poisson more than anyone else! But what is left now of either besides death and ruin? You've singlehandedly destroyed everything that was beautiful, everything I've ever loved!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 12.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Don't listen to him, Boss. He's just spouting nonsense.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 22.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Have you ever considered that... Maybe the people around you don't actually care about you at all?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 23.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Have you ever considered that... Maybe you only get respect because you're Callas and Clementine's child? That you've never done anything worthy, that you're just a big nothing?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 24.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Have you ever considered that... Maybe people don't stay in Poisson because of you, but only because they have such beautiful memories of the past, before you came!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (Because if you do falter, there will inevitably come a time when you'll have to face the consequences. And when that time comes, those most precious to you really will throw themselves in front of you, and pay the price for your mistakes...)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (Yeah... looking back on it now as an adult, I can hardly believe how patient and kind everyone was.)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 26.ogg}} '''Navia:''' (But is that really why they support me? Is their kindness... real?)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 adele 06.ogg}} '''Adele:''' Shut your mouth! I, for one, really like Miss Navia! And my mom loves her, too!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 27.ogg}} '''Navia:''' !!!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 adele 07.ogg}} '''Adele:''' I don't know how to explain it, but I like her, and that's that!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 13.ogg}} '''Florent:''' I'm sure Mr. Melus would be extremely disappointed in you right now.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 14.ogg}} '''Florent:''' You've somehow managed to pin the blame for every mistake and tragedy in our history on the Boss herself.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 colter 25.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Get out of the way, Florent. I don't want to hurt you.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 15.ogg}} '''Florent:''' You're gonna have to.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 florent 16.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Boss, there's no time for this! Stop hesitating and get out of here before you get buried!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 28.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Maybe you think you're being the realist by painting the history of the Spina and Poisson like this.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 29.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But the love that I've felt from everyone was just as real. I've felt it. They've helped me get to where I am.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 1 navia 30.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And even now, I will continue to believe in that love. So let me show you just how much I love the Spina di Rosula!

{{Quest Description|update|As it turns out, Colter has always been nursing a grudge against Navia, and had been looking for a chance to strike...}}
;(Navia engages Colter in battle)

;(After the battle ends)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 2 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Florent, I'll leave the town to you. Summon the other members and help with the evacuation of the townspeople.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 2 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If you find any of Colter's accomplices, subdue them quickly, and don't give them the chance to harm any ordinary civilians.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 2 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I can't allow my partner to face the danger on the Clementine Line alone.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 2 florent 01.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Got it, Boss. I'm on it.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 2 florent 02.ogg}} '''Florent:''' ...Are you okay, Navia?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 2 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I don't know, but I have to go.
:{{Black Screen|A short while earlier, you and Paimon dashed to the entrance of Poisson.}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|You must find Romeuf and his subordinates as soon as possible to stop the imminent explosion.}}
:{{A|vo nvlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's hurry up there! We have to protect the Clementine Line.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If they're gonna blow up the waterway, they must have planted the explosives next to the support pillars!

;(After defeating some enemies)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They certainly brought a lot of muscle! Ugh, they're really slowing us down!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if we're meeting resistance, we must be heading in the right direction!

;(After defeating the enemies by the explosives)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These must be the explosives, right? And this is the control mechanism... Uh, how can we disable it?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's too scared to touch any of this stuff...
:{{DIcon}} What's this?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? There's a strangely shaped hole here. What is it for?
:{{DIcon}} Could it be some kind of keyhole?
:{{DIcon}} Or maybe an emergency switch?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That certainly sounds possible... Maybe one of the people we just beat up has the key?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, you take this side, Paimon will take the other, let's see what we can find!

;(Talk to Paimon before finding the key, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let me turn this guy over... Oof, he's super heavy... He could probably eat a whole Paimon just for breakfast...

;(After finding the key)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you found it! That's amazing!
:;(Obtain [[Strangely-Shaped Key]])

;(Talk to Paimon after finding the key, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's turn off the device right now... We're running out of time!

;(After disabling the mechanism)
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That should do it, right?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Navia and Florent should be able to relax now.
:{{DIcon}} We should still check out the perimeter, just in case.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right, they could have set explosives elsewhere, too... Let's go!
;(A cinematic plays)
::{{Cutscene Description|You feel the ground suddenly tremble, and an explosion is heard from the mountaintop.

At this moment, Navia makes it to the scene.<br>Unleashing her weapons, she accurately and elegantly destroys all the falling boulders.<br>When the dust clears, the threat has dissipated. You look at Navia, and she gives you a confident smile and a victory sign &mdash; and only then do you notice the exhaustion written on her face.}}
::'''Paimon:''' They're gonna bury Poisson!
::'''Navia:''' Great work, partner!
::'''Navia:''' Just leave the rest to me!
::'''Paimon:''' Watch out, Navia!
::'''Paimon:''' You can't block them all!
::'''Navia:''' Block?
::'''Navia:''' I'm doing this the Spina way!
::'''Navia:''' Fire!

:{{Black Screen|Having been alerted, members of the Maison Gardiennage arrive at the scene a short time later, and take Romeuf and all of his followers into custody.}}
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 esmond 01.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' I heard from Thierry that even they're your enemies now, they were once a part of Spina di Rosula. Do you plan to settle this privately with them?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I have nothing more to say to them.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Regardless of whether their hatred and anger towards me or the Spina was justified, anyone who's willing to endanger innocent civilians is no longer sane enough to even be worth trying to talk to.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Please prosecute them in accordance to the law. Spina di Rosula will not raise any objections.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 esmond 02.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Sounds good. We're very appreciative of your help. Without it, the consequences would have been far worse.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 esmond 03.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Alright, this operation is a wrap. Take 'em away!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We won, Navia! We saved everyone! And you were so cool!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yeah... Luckily, we were just in time...
:{{DIcon}} You look a little pale...
:{{DIcon}} Feeling a bit fatigued?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha, it's probably because I expended too much elemental energy at once. Haha... I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, but you usually glow up whenever other people compliment you. Paimon's not used to seeing you like this.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 florent 01.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Boss, we managed to catch all the infiltrators in the town. The Maison Gardiennage is taking them away as well.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 florent 02.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Seems like Romeuf really went all in on this mission. If he sent literally everyone he had, though, that also means we've caught them all, too. We won't have to worry about them from now on.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Got it. That's good, at least.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 colter 01.ogg}} '''Colter:''' ...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Colter.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I can understand how you feel. The things that we lost... they're forever beyond our grasp now, and that makes them appear even more precious.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I am not Callas, and I will also never become him. The Spina and the Poisson that you loved are both gone.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But I will not change how I feel about our future. I still believe that this is a great opportunity to start anew.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I will spend more of what the Spina earns on the betterment of Poisson. What's more, I'd also like to propose some changes to the aquabus routes...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So that one day, the people of Poisson will enjoy the boons it brings as well.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 colter 02.ogg}} '''Colter:''' I know what you're trying to say. Mr. Callas... would never have said anything like that.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 colter 03.ogg}} '''Colter:''' There are too many things in life that are just beyond our control. In that, we are the same.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Henceforth, you are no longer a member of Spina di Rosula.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But once you're discharged from the Fortress again, you're welcome to pay another visit to Poisson.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 colter 04.ogg}} '''Colter:''' Thank you, Navia.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 florent 03.ogg}} '''Florent:''' As I thought... Boss really is a kind and gentle person.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...She is also, I must say, a truly unlucky person.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thank you for protecting the Clementine Line.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' {{Traveler}}, I was actually really scared, you know. I mean, even the Callas Line won't be getting rebuilt anytime soon...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If I'd lost the Clementine Line too, I wouldn't know how to live with myself.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' A name is a way to etch a memory onto the world. Losing the line that bears her name, that I can see every day, would be like losing my mother all over again.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Seeing it still standing there, tall and proud... It makes me really happy.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened while we were gone? Honestly, you look more upset than tired or anything...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 florent 04.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Just give her some time.
:{{DIcon}} It's okay, everything's fine now.
:{{DIcon}} I'll get you back to Poisson.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Mhm, thank you so much. Can you give me a hand? I really don't have much strength left.

:{{Color|menu|You slowly return to Poisson while supporting Navia...}}
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' {{Traveler}}... I want to ask you something. And please, tell me the truth.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Do you really see me as your "partner"?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo nvlq003 5 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's good then.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 5 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hearing that... It brings me more relief than I can say.

:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How do you feel, Navia? Any better after taking a break?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Mhm, I feel quite a bit better, but I should probably still rest for a few more days.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Sorry, partner, I said some weird things earlier. Feel free to just ignore me.
:{{DIcon}} A little weird, that's true.
:{{DIcon}} But that's because I've never heard you doubt yourself before.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I used to think I'd never doubt myself, but you could say I've discovered that I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Colter mentioned my parents, as well as Melus and Silver. It's all thanks to them that I've made it this far in life.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Do you think... they ever regretted the choices they made? Has my existence... made this world a better place?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't think like that, Navia, you've already done more than enough.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 paimon 03a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo nvlq003 6 paimon 03b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' No matter what others think, we'll always support you to the end of the world!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 florent 01.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Well, since it's ended up like this, I suppose it's time for me to make a confession as well.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 florent 02.ogg}} '''Florent:''' There's something that I've been keeping from you as well, Boss. Please follow me... Everything's already prepared.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey, Florent, I hope you can understand that I can't deal with any more "shocking revelations" right now.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 6 florent 03.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Don't worry, this surprise will be a pleasant one.

{{Quest Description|update|Fortunately, the whole matter was resolved with little loss, and Poisson was spared another round of harm. Still, Navia, who has done her best to defend the town, doesn't seem too well herself...}}
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Why is everyone gathered here? And what's... this?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 01.ogg}} '''Florent:''' This was supposed to be a gift to you from everyone in town. We were originally planning to show it to you once it was finished...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 02.ogg}} '''Florent:''' But special times call for special measures. I've never seen you look so defeated before, so I've decided to show you the designs before the final product was done.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I... Do I really look that bad?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 03.ogg}} '''Florent:''' Well, if you're ready, I'll unveil the present.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Mhm...
;(Florent unveils statue designs of Callas, Clementine, and Navia)
:[[File:Yesterday's Tears Tomorrow's Light Statue.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Th&mdash;This is...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Papa, Mother, and... me...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 04.ogg}} '''Florent:''' We designed the look for Ms. Clementine based on old Kamera records, as well as personal recollections from the members of the Spina.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, this is the statue you mentioned before!?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 05.ogg}} '''Florent:''' It is indeed. To be honest, we decided on the design a long time ago, and gave the sculptor permission to begin working.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 06.ogg}} '''Florent:''' We only asked Boss to decide on a design so she wouldn't realize we had already started.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 yvette 01.ogg}} '''Yvette:''' How could we only have statues of Mr. Callas and Mrs. Clementine?
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 sandino 01.ogg}} '''Sandino:''' Even though Boss is still young, we've all seen the work she's put in regarding the whole Sinthe business and the rebuilding of Poisson.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 archenoul 01.ogg}} '''Archenoul:''' We wanted to commemorate her contributions with a statue as well.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 adele 01.ogg}} '''Adele:''' I don't know what Spina di Rosula was like in the past, but I know it's a great organization now!
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 coralie 01.ogg}} '''Coralie:''' With Navia around, we're not worried about this place's future.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 07.ogg}} '''Florent:''' We're gathered here today to tell our Boss&mdash;
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 florent 08.ogg}} '''Florent:''' That we support you and believe in you wholeheartedly. I believe everyone's here for you, not the glory days.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 paimon 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo nvlq003 7 paimon 02b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' That's what we believe as well!
:{{DIcon}} I will also always believe in the bond between us.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thank you so much, everyone... Then I'll be brave and just accept everyone's support for what it is...
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' This really is quite the surprise.
:{{A|vo nvlq003 7 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I never thought that I'd have the chance to stand next to my mother... Not even in my wildest dreams.
;(Quest ends)
----
;(Talk to Navia after the quest ends, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It seems like I started to question myself a bit too much. I'll pick myself up again, and become a more reliable President, for all of you.
:{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Looking back on it, I'm honestly embarrassed by how I acted earlier, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} About the gift from the townspeople...
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03a 1.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'm sure everyone longs for that one thing in life that seems trivial to others, but they themselves can never obtain.
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03a 2.ogg}} '''Navia:''' To me, that would be a family portrait. I've always been super jealous of other people's family photos...
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03a 3.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I never thought I'd receive a family portrait of my very own, especially not like this. Seems like I'm not such an unlucky person after all.
:{{DIcon}} About Clementine...
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03b 1.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You know, I've thought about it before... Though my mother "only" wanted me to live a happy life, that's actually a tall order as well. In practice, it's just as hard to achieve as my father's expectations for me.
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03b 2.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Even though my parents had very different personalities, they always had a lot of respect for each other.
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03b 3.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The aquabus project was a monumental project that stood to benefit all of Fontaine. It would have been a little close-minded to assess or evaluate it only from the perspective of the "clan."
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03b 4.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I think that's probably why she didn't step in to mediate, or oppose the building of the lines.
:{{DIcon}} About asking "do you really see me as your partner"...
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03c 1.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Whoa whoa whoa, why do you have to remind me? Please, don't say that again! It's super embarrassing for me!
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03c 2.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Forget it now, please forget that I ever said anything! Ah, wait, but it'd also be bad if you were to forget it...
::{{A|vo dialog nvlq003 navia 03c 3.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Okay, but please keep it a secret between us from now on! Please don't ever mention it again!
