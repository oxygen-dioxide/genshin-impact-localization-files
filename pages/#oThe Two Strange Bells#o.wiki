==Lore==
Ringing these two bells dispels the dark fog shrouding the [[Nameless Ruins]] and summons the [[Abyss Herald]]s Agnarr and Egill, who seem to guard the place. The inscriptions near the northwest bell read "Imperator Agnarr" and "I mourn for the dead," while those near the southeast bell read "Pious Egill" and "I call the living."<ref name="Messages">{{Ref/HEO|Secret Messages in The Chasm}}</ref>

The [[Anton|Ninth Company]] of the [[Fatui]] investigated the bells prior to the [[Traveler]]'s arrival. They rang them and faced Agnarr and Egill, but were forced to retreat with 10 dead and 2 vanguard squads severely damaged.<ref name="Perils">{{Ref/Quest|Perils in the Dark}}</ref>

By the time the Traveler reaches the Nameless Ruins, the fog has reappeared, suggesting that this occurs if Agnarr and Egill are not defeated. After the Traveler rings the bells and defeats the Heralds, the fog permanently dissipates.<ref name="Perils" />
