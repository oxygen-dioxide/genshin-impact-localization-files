{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chaonan:''' ...Best if you say the bare minimum to me. I don't want to deplete my stamina.
:'''Chaonan:''' *sigh* If I'd known this would happen, I would have followed my dreams...
:{{DIcon}} Are you tired?
::'''Chaonan:''' ...I'm a ship repairman. When the ships are at sea, I have nothing to do. But when they dock, I'm so busy I never get a wink of sleep...
::'''Chaonan:''' So I have decided to conserve my stamina from now on. Otherwise, I won't be able to cope when the busy period hits.
::{{DIcon}} Have you considered a change of occupation?
:::'''Chaonan:''' Well, this job is rather busy, but being busy also means that there's money to be made.
:::'''Chaonan:''' We have [[Rex Lapis]]' divine predictions to thank for that. The number of merchants going out to sea has increased year on year in recent times, which has led to our business being on the rise, too.
:::'''Chaonan:''' Those merchants who made their fortune aren't stingy, either. They often give us some tips on top of the repair fees.
:::'''Chaonan:''' Hard work begets an equal reward, and for the lads that want to earn some money while they're young, this job is pretty good. We shouldn't waste the opportunity that Rex Lapis has given us.
:{{DIcon}} What dreams?
::'''Chaonan:''' ...I once had the opportunity to join the Crux Fleet, but by the time I signed up, they were full.
::'''Chaonan:''' I gave up on being a seafarer in the end, and went into ship repair work instead. Now I can only watch as the ships go in and out.
::'''Chaonan:''' Maybe if I'd pushed a little harder for it back in the day, I wouldn't have ended up where I am now.
::'''Chaonan:''' And maybe the reason I've not been favored enough to receive a [[Vision]] is because I give up too easily.
::'''Chaonan:''' ...I hope you don't end up like me.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} What a pity...
:::'''Chaonan:''' The problem is my personality... That, and luck not being on my side.
:::'''Chaonan:''' *sigh* It's funny, you know, the day before I signed up I even made a point of going out and buying this feather, which is supposed to bring good luck. Clearly, it had no effect whatsoever...
:::'''Chaonan:''' ...Well, no use complaining about it. Here, you can have it, maybe it works better on adventurers.
::;(Obtain 2{{Star}} {{Item|Lucky Dog's Eagle Feather}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Chaonan:''' Goodbye. Now to focus all my energy on getting a good rest...
