==Occurrence==
While the occurrence probability of a specific minor affix is useful, the probability of occurrence of that specific minor affix with respect to the 4 possible minor affixes of an artifact is a more practical application of its [[Artifact/Distribution|distribution]].

While the gap between the occurrence probabilities of some minor affixes are relatively large, it is compensated by having 4 minor affix slots, bridging some of the gap between minor affixes that have a low rolling chances. In short, this indicates the probability of an artifact with 4 minor affixes that a specific minor affix is one of them.

The rate of the most common CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG pair is also especially shown to highlight the large decrease of probability as more minor affixes out of the 4 are specified.

==Mathematical Treatment==
Consider a collection of at most 4 occurrable minor affixes, each respectively with a probability of <math>p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4</math>.
The specific minor affixes occurrence probability is <math>\prod_{i=1}^4\frac{p_i}{1+(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}-p_j)}</math>
