<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Cyrus was a sage of great renown in Sumeru Akademiya, even having a quote on [[Bimarstan's Proverb Column]], which contains quotes from the Akademiya's greatest scholars. As a professor, Cyrus had several students, including Lisa, Cyno, and [[Gafoor]].<ref name="windblume cyno lisa" /><ref>Event [[Second Blooming]] NPC Dialogue: [[Lisa]] - [[Second Blooming/Story#The Akademiya|The Akademiya]]</ref>

Cyrus nearly died while exploring the [[Great Red Sand]] for research, but was saved by the [[Temple of Silence]]. Upon learning of [[Bamoun]]'s plan to implant two Ba Fragments into children &mdash; Cyrus disagreed with his opinion. The two children, [[Cyno]] and [[Sethos]], successfully resonated with the fragments, but when they began to show signs of instability, Bamoun had the fragments implanted in them before they dissipated for good.<ref name="cyno sq2">{{Ref/Quest|Oathkeeper}}</ref> Cyrus disagreed with this and subsequently left with Cyno, damaging the organization's plans.<ref name="windblume cyno lisa" /> He would later raise Cyno while attending to his studies and lectures.

When Lisa entered Sumeru Akademiya, he took a liking to her work early on and deemed her to be the greatest scholar the Akademiya had seen in 200 years.<ref name="lisa story 2">{{Ref/CS|Lisa|2}}</ref> He invited her to join several major projects, but most of them ultimately failed due to trying to attain "wisdom beyond mortal understanding" at great cost. Disillusioned by the "lunacy" of these projects, Lisa decided to leave the Akademiya after she graduated a mere two years later. Cyrus evidently sympathized with her decision and never tried persuading her to stay.<ref name="second blooming quest" />

In the [[manga]], Lisa sent a letter to her "teacher" at Sumeru Akademiya regarding an ancient language she could not decipher, found in a [[Fatui]] document pertaining to the god remains inside [[Collei]].<ref>{{Ref/Manga|8|2}}</ref> Cyno was dispatched to [[Mondstadt]] in response,<ref>{{Ref/Manga|12|2}}</ref> and he successfully sealed the remains. Afterwards, he took Collei back to Sumeru and left her in [[Tighnari]]'s care.

Following his retirement, Cyrus now resides in the [[Bimarstan]] area. His residence is seen in the {{Quest|Wondrous Times}}, where [[Zaha Hadi]] is found angrily accusing Cyrus of sabotaging her tomato plant for a competition between fellow retired professors.

Bamoun, desiring revenge against Cyrus for the damage he caused to the Temple of Silence, devised a plan with Sethos in order to lure him back and claim Cyno's fragment. They convinced a student, [[Urraca]], to bring a damning letter to the Akademiya accusing Cyrus of fraud. The letter was also dotted with motifs of the desert, which he would recognize. As expected, Cyrus realized the intent behind the letter and set off to the desert alone, with Cyno chasing after him in the process. Cyno's friends &mdash; the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]] and [[Tighnari]], went after Cyno and discovered the Temple of Silence, where they learned of Cyrus' past with the organization. Cyno, unwilling to let his foster guardian be harmed, offered to engage in a duel with Sethos for his safety, which he agreed to. Cyno and his friends ultimately won the duel, and Cyrus returned to the Akademiya afterwards, only to be scolded by [[Naphis]] for his recklessness.<ref name="cyno sq2" />

After catching up with his workload, Cyrus discovered several photos of him and Cyno when they were younger, which had been taken by Lisa. After some reminiscing, Cyno suggests paying a visit to Lisa, and he agrees to do so next week, only to remember about his contest with [[Zaha Hadi]] and his desire to beat her.

==Trivia==
[[File:Faranak's Drawing.png|thumb|Faranak's drawing; Cyrus appeared as the rightmost figure]]
* During {{Quest|Wondrous Times}}, Kaveh and the [[Traveler]] find [[Faranak]]'s drawing of her [[Kaveh's Father|husband]] with three other male acquaintances, two of whom are heavily implied to be Tighnari's and [[Alhaitham]]'s fathers.  Cyrus is the rightmost man, given several context clues:
** The man wears an Akademiya uniform that shows off his association with the [[Spantamad]] Darshan, the same Darshan Cyrus mentored for.
** Earlier in the quest, Tighnari explains that Cyrus is Cyno's adoptive father, while Faranak's notes about the drawing notes that there were three couples present at the gathering and one single man. The three couples would be Tighnari, Kaveh, and Alhaitham's parents, while Cyno was adopted by Cyrus and thus, Cyrus does not necessarily have a wife.
** Based on the above, the {{w|authorial intent}} is that Tighnari, Kaveh, Alhaitham, and Cyno are the "next generation" of their parents' friend group, even if by coincidence. This is reinforced by the quest's ending illustration, Leisurely Gathering, which depicts the four sitting in the same order as their fathers did in Faranak's drawing.

===Etymology===
* {{w|Cyrus}} is the Latinized form of Greek {{Lang|mini=1|el={{wt|Κῦρος}}|el_rm=Kȳros}}, from Old Persian {{Lang|mini=1|peo={{wt|𐎤𐎢𐎽𐎢𐏁}}|peo_rm=Kūruš}}. The modern Persian name {{Lang|mini=1|fa=کوروش|fa_rm={{w|Kourosh}}}}, which is also the name of [[Kourosh|another Sumeru NPC]], is related. Many notable Persian figures are known as Cyrus in English, including {{w|Cyrus the Great}}, his grandfather {{w|Cyrus I}}, and {{w|Cyrus the Younger}}. 
** While Mondstadt's [[Cyrus]] and [["Cyrus"|the Sumpter Beast named after him]] use the English Latinized form or its equivalent across all localizations, Sumeru's Cyrus does not.
*** His name in Chinese, {{zh|居勒什|Jūlèshí}}, is a variation of {{zh|居鲁士|rm=Jūlǔshì}}, the Chinese version of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of {{w|zh:居鲁士二世|Cyrus the Great}}, {{w|zh:居鲁士一世|Cyrus I}}, and {{w|zh:小居鲁士|Cyrus the Younger}}.
*** His name in Japanese, {{ja|ジュライセン|Juraisen}}, is derived from a rough phonetic reading of his name in Mandarin Chinese rather than the Japanese version of Cyrus in real life, which is {{ja|キュロス|Kyurosu}} as seen in the names of {{w|ja:キュロス2世|Cyrus the Great}}, {{w|ja:キュロス1世|Cyrus I}}, and {{w|ja:小キュロス|Cyrus the Younger}}.
*** His name in Korean, {{ko|키루스|Kiruseu}}, is the Korean version of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of {{w|ko:키루스 2세 보졸그|Cyrus the Great}} and {{w|ko:키루스|Cyrus the Younger}}.
*** His name in Spanish, {{es|{{w|es:Ciro (nombre)|Ciro}}}}, is the Spanish Latinized form of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of {{w|es:Ciro II el Grande|Cyrus the Great}} and {{w|es:Especial:PáginasPorPrefijo/Ciro|many others}}.
