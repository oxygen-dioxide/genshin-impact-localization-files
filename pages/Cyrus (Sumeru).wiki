'''Cyrus''' is a retired<ref name="windblume cyno lisa" /> [[Sumeru Akademiya]] professor. He is part of the [[Spantamad]] Darshan,<ref group="Note">In ''[[A Librarian's Long and Carefree Vacation]]'', Lisa tells Gafoor that she will be at "the Darshan reunion," which is evidently for their Darshan, Spantamad. A few days later, [[Second_Blooming/Story#The_Akademiya|Lisa attended the reunion]]. Cyrus was present for the reunion, thus making it unlikely that he is not of the Spantamad Darshan.</ref> and [[Lisa]] was his student.<ref name="second blooming quest">{{Ref/Quest|A Librarian's Long and Carefree Vacation}}</ref>

==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
[[Cyno]] was once subjected to great suffering as a result of the power of Hermanubis. Instead of treating Cyno as a test subject as was expected, Cyrus adopted Cyno and raised him as a son.<ref name="windblume cyno lisa" />

Cyrus was already a professor by the time Lisa entered Sumeru Akademiya. He took a liking to Lisa's work early on and invited her to join several major projects. Many of those projects ended up failing due to trying to attain "wisdom beyond mortal understanding" at great cost. As a result, after only two years at the Akademiya, Lisa told Cyrus she would leave after graduating.<ref name="second blooming quest" />

Cyrus has had several students, including Lisa and Cyno when he eventually entered the Akademiya.<ref>Event [[Second Blooming]] NPC Dialogue: [[Lisa]] - [[Second_Blooming/Story#The_Akademiya|The Akademiya]]</ref><ref name="windblume cyno lisa" /> The only other known student is [[Gafoor]], who was Lisa's classmate and is currently a professor.

Cyrus seems to be renowned in the Akademiya, as his praise of Lisa is apparently a good indicator of how academically talented she is.<ref name="lisa story 2">{{Ref/CS|Lisa|2}}</ref> He also has [[Bimarstan's_Proverb_Column#Cyrus'_Quote|a quote posted on Bimarstan's Proverb Column]].

===Personality===
Not enough is known about Cyrus for a general personality profile. However, he is said to have been stubborn, especially before taking in Cyno and later retiring.<ref name="windblume cyno lisa" /> Cyrus also seems to be a level-headed researcher, as he accepted Lisa's reason for leaving the Akademiya after she witnessed the lengths to which people went in pursuit of wisdom,<ref name="second blooming quest" /> and he also advised Cyno on the dangers of the reckless pursuit of wisdom.<ref name="cyno story 4">{{Ref/CS|Cyno|4}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* As Cyrus seems to be an important link between Cyno and Lisa,<ref name="windblume cyno lisa" /> he may also be the following unnamed figures:
** The sage who both Cyno and Lisa studied under.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Cyno|About Lisa}}</ref>
** The "teacher" Lisa contacted in the [[manga]] with a request to have someone she knew read the ancient language on a Fatui document related to Collei's affliction.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|8|2}}</ref> Cyno later showed up to seal the god's remains in Collei.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|12|2}}</ref> While various details from the manga have changed since its publication, many parts remain unchanged, including Cyno's role in sealing the god's remains in Collei, so it is likely that Lisa still contacted her teacher with the request that led to Cyno's involvement.

===Etymology===
* {{w|Cyrus}} is the Latinized form of Greek {{lang|mini=1|el={{wt|Κῦρος}}|el_rm=Kȳros}}, from Old Persian {{wt|𐎤𐎢𐎽𐎢𐏁}} ''Kūruš''. The modern Persian name {{lang|mini=1|fa=کوروش|fa_rm={{w|Kourosh}}}}, which is also the name of [[Kourosh|another Sumeru NPC]], is related. Many notable Persian figures are known as Cyrus in English, including {{w|Cyrus the Great}}, his grandfather {{w|Cyrus I}}, and {{w|Cyrus the Younger}}. 
** While Mondstadt's [[Cyrus]] and [["Cyrus"|the Sumpter Beast named after him]] use the English Latinized form or its equivalent across all localizations, Sumeru's Cyrus does not.
*** His name in Chinese, {{zh|居勒什|Jūlèshí}}, is a variation of {{zh|居鲁士|rm=Jūlǔshì}}, the Chinese version of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of {{w|zh:居鲁士二世|Cyrus the Great}}, {{w|zh:居鲁士一世|Cyrus I}}, and {{w|zh:小居鲁士|Cyrus the Younger}}.
*** His name in Japanese, {{ja|ジュライセン|Juraisen}}, is derived from a rough phonetic reading of his name in Mandarin Chinese rather than the Japanese version of Cyrus in real life, which is {{ja|キュロス|Kyurosu}} as seen in the names of {{w|ja:キュロス2世|Cyrus the Great}}, {{w|ja:キュロス1世|Cyrus I}}, and {{w|ja:小キュロス|Cyrus the Younger}}.
*** His name in Korean, {{kr|키루스|Kiruseu}}, is the Korean version of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of {{w|ko:키루스_2세_보졸그|Cyrus the Great}} and {{w|ko:키루스|Cyrus the Younger}}.
*** His name in Spanish, {{w|es:Ciro_(nombre)|Ciro}}, is the Spanish Latinized form of Cyrus in real life as seen in the names of {{w|es:Ciro_II_el_Grande|Cyrus the Great}} and {{w|es:Especial:PáginasPorPrefijo/Ciro|many others}}.
