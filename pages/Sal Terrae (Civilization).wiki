Sal Terrae was the name of a civilization ruled by [[Havria]]. It can be explored in Zhongli's Story Quest, in the domain [[Of Mysteries and Salt]].

==History==
Originally, Sal Terrae used to be much larger. As Havria ceded her lands in a desperate attempt of preventing the war from reaching her civilization, the territory dwindled to a small cavern underground.

Eventually, her people turned on her. Either believing her to be too weak to be a worthy god, or wishing to grant her a merciful death, their king executed Havria. The power of her death caused an explosion that turned all those in the vicinity to salt. A few outside the radius managed to flee, and integrated into [[Morax]]'s [[Liyue Harbor]].

===Legacy===
The civilization of Sal Terrae is survived by [[Yinyuan Hall]].
