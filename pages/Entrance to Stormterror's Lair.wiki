The '''Entrance to Stormterror's Lair''' is a notable set of ruins built in the [[Decarabian's Mondstadt#Architecture and Design|Decarabian style]] that leads directly into [[Decarabian]]'s capital city. Soldiers used to be stationed along the road in Brightcrown Canyon leading into the city.<ref name="TTG1">{{Ref/Book|Teyvat Travel Guide|1}}</ref> In-game, the road leading out of the city leads to the boar habitat to the south; whether there were other parts of the road that have since been lost is a mystery.
