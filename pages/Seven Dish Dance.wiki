==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The {{Lang|"seven dish dance"|zh=七盘舞}} is an ancient Chinese dance during which {{Lang|"dishes and drums"|zh=盘鼓}} are placed on the ground and dancers tap their feet against or jump off them in a rhythmic fashion.
*The whole Chinese name of the achievement is a sentence from a {{w|Han poetry#Fu|{{Lang|(Han) Fu|zh=（汉）赋}}}} named {{Lang|''WU Fu''|zh=《舞赋》}} by {{w|Zhang Heng|{{Lang|Zhang Heng|zh=张衡}}}}. Despite the unintact context, this sentence still paints a picture of seven dish dancers skipping Lightly on the dishes and drums.
