|description    = A plant commonly found in the wilds of [[Natlan]]. There are two differing interpretations regarding the origin of its name. Some believe it derives from its striking blue leaves, which immediately calls to mind the ocean's endless waves. Others, however, argue that it is because the oil of its fruit is ideal for maintaining surfboards. If you were to take a stroll around the [[People of the Springs]], you would soon notice that many of their surfboards give off its distinctive fragrance &mdash; and it is this, they say, that first led people to make this association with the waves.
