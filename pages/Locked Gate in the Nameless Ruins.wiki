'''Locked Gate in the Nameless Ruins''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] located in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. It consists of finding nine [[Orb of the Blue Depths]]. Finding all 9 orbs will allow the player to unlock the gate in the [[Nameless Ruins]] which grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[CREDE TENEBRIS]]."

Inside the room there is a [[Mysterious Letter]], one [[Exquisite Chest]], one [[Precious Chest]] and one [[Luxurious Chest]].

==Locations==
The player must find and defeat the nine named [[Shadowy Husks]] scattered across underground mines. Two of these, both Windcutters, are accompanied by additional Shadowy Husks; the remaining seven are by themselves.

* '''Haltaf: The Young''' is a [[Shadowy Husk: Standard Bearer]] located east in [[The Serpent's Cave]]. He is surrounded by [[Dark Mud]], which can be cleared out.
* '''Skeld: Augur of the Mirrors''' is a [[Shadowy Husk: Defender]] located in a locked room west of the [[Ad-Hoc Main Tunnel]]. Use [[Miner's Key]] to open the gate, which is obtainable from a narrow passageway north of [[The Serpent's Cave]]. Some Dark Mud is near him that will fall from the ceiling when approached, although he is still out of range of it and the mud respawns even when cleansed.
* '''Edgetho: Breaker of the Oath of Silence''' is a [[Black Serpent Knight: Windcutter]] located in the middle of the [[Underground Waterway]]. He is accompanied by a [[Shadowy Husk: Standard Bearer]].
* '''Hyglacg: Rebuked Servant''' is a [[Shadowy Husk: Line Breaker]] located downstream of the [[Underground Waterway]].
* '''Serkir: Scribe of Swords''' is a [[Shadowy Husk: Defender]] located south in the [[Nameless Ruins]].
* '''Buliwyf: Guardian of Desolation''' is a [[Black Serpent Knight: Windcutter]] located east in the southern room of the [[Stony Halls]]. He is accompanied by a [[Shadowy Husk: Defender]] and a [[Shadowy Husk: Standard Bearer]].
* '''Roneth: Banished Knight''' is a [[Shadowy Husk: Defender]] located east in [[The Glowing Narrows]].
* '''Herger: Jester of Bloody Tears''' is a [[Shadowy Husk: Line Breaker]] located north-west in [[The Glowing Narrows]].
* '''Rethel: Slain of the Split Bow''' is a [[Black Serpent Knight: Windcutter]] located in the tunnel leading west of [[The Glowing Narrows]].
