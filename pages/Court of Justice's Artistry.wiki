|description    = One of the standard types of housing in the [[Court of Fontaine]]'s [[Quartier Lyonnais]] utilizing a regular, symmetrical design. [[Leschots Clockworks]] is one store that has adopted this architectural style. According to a research group at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], this symmetrical design projects a sense of stability and reliability, and as a result, it subconsciously raises people's confidence in a store's merchandise. But the research group failed to consider the reality of municipal planning in the Court of Fontaine &mdash; the main road of Quartier Lyonnais curves, and customers rarely approach a building from the front, so few ever notice the design that's supposed to subconsciously influence them.
