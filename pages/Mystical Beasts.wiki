'''Mystical Beasts''' are enemies which are strongly affected by the [[elements]]. As opposed to [[Elemental Lifeforms]], they are not purely made out of elemental energy; however, they are more resilient to damage of their own element.

Common and Elite Mystical Beasts can be found across [[Teyvat]].
