{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marker in Court of Fontaine{{Colon}} Quartier Lyonnais)
:{{A|vo qzlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems like there's another event going on at the Court of Fontaine! Look at that &mdash; roadside signs as far as the eye can see!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see what they're for... "Fontaine Fashion Week"?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, why don't we go check out some of the shops? Maybe we can pick up some cool new clothes!

;(Idle quote)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} {{A|vo dialog qzlq001 graciette 03.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' ...It's Fashion Week right now...

;(Talk to Graciette and Trudaine, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 graciette 01.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' Fashion Week is coming up! My husband promised to get me a replica of the most eye-catching outfit from the show.
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 trudaine 01.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Oh, I say! As expected of a high-flying merchant! How generous of him!
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 trudaine 02.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Well, what a coincidence, though &mdash; my husband promised me precisely the same thing!
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 graciette 02.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' Oh dear! Whatever are we going to do, then, if we fall in love with the same dress?
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 trudaine 03.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Well, let's leave our gentlemen to figure that one out for themselves, shall we?

;(Approach Chiori and Laetitia)
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 laetitia 01.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Is... Is this really okay?
;(If the player has met Chiori before)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I told you I could do it using the leftover funds from the original deposit. Don't tell me you're afraid that I cheaped out on the dress?
;(If the player has not met Chiori before)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 01.ogg}} '''???:''' I told you I could do it using the leftover funds from the original deposit. Don't tell me you're afraid that I cheaped out on the dress?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 laetitia 02.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' No, not at all! I have only the fullest faith in your work, Miss Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 laetitia 03.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' I'm just in shock, that's all. It's always been my dream to wear a Chioriya Boutique dress for my wedding... I really thought the chance had passed me by...
;(If the player did not participate in the [[Roses and Muskets]] event)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, is that lady the owner of Chioriya Boutique? We've never seen her before!
::{{DIcon}} Her work probably keeps her very busy.
::{{DIcon}} Well, Eloffe is usually the one staffing the shop...
;(If the player participated in the Roses and Muskets event)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, isn't that Chiori? She's actually at her shop today!
::{{DIcon}} Perhaps it's because of "Fontaine Fashion Week"?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, you've got a point there! Well, once she's done with her customer, we can go and ask her!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'm a woman of my word &mdash; If I say I can do something, then it will be done. The first rule of business is to always keep your promises.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Now, remember to not fold the gown, or store it under direct sunlight. I'd recommend only taking it out on the day of your wedding, but from the look on your face... I can tell that may be a little difficult for you.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 laetitia 04.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' I&mdash;I'll try my best! Hehe... Once he sees me in this, his jaw is gonna drop straight to the floor!

;(If the player did not participate in the Roses and Muskets event)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Are you here to check out the offerings?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure are! Paimon's Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}. You're Ms. Chiori, the owner of this boutique, right?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That's right. Navia's told me about you &mdash; glad to make your acquaintance.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've heard a lot about you, too! "Chioriya Boutique" is super famous in Fontaine!
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, I appreciate the recognition. Is there anything you're looking for exactly? We're out of kids' clothes right now, I am afraid.
;(If the player participated in the Roses and Muskets event)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori! You're actually at your shop today!
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Is that really so shocking? It is mine, after all.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Anything you're looking for today? A custom design, or perhaps some ready-to-wear outfits for kids?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon's not a kid!
:{{DIcon}} We actually wanted to ask about "Fontaine Fashion Week"...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, that. Well, if news of the event has reached your ears, I suppose the Fontaine Apparel Association's advertising efforts have paid off.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are there any fun and popular activities that we can take part in?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm... Fashion Week isn't what I'd call "fun," but it certainly always attracts a crowd. It's a fashion extravaganza that only takes place once a year, after all.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Will you be showing off some of your designs, too?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Of course. All designers at the Court of Fontaine use the week to advertise their brand. If you're lucky, you could even land a large amount of orders as soon as the main show ends.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Come to think of it, it was also at a previous Fashion Week that our label first took off.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... aren't you pretty much an established name now? People will still buy your clothes even if you don't participate this year, right?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That's not quite how it works. While many people buy clothes for fit and style, the fashion industry also strongly values a label's artistic vision and creative direction.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Why would anyone patronize a label that hasn't even bothered to put out any new designs for the year?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' In the end, "fashion" is just a representation of the spirit of the times. People support your brand because they support the vision it represents.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh okay... so maybe fashion's more complicated than Paimon thought...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All that complicated stuff aside, you're saying we'll be able to see new Chioriya designs at the show?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Absolutely. The designs have already been finalized &mdash; I'm just waiting for the fabrics to arrive.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Are you using materials you can't get in Fontaine?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, I still have a certain partiality to Inazuma-made fabrics. The textures are pleasant to the touch, and their familiarity gives me a sense of security.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon gets it. It's that feeling of home!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 18.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Something like that, yes.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're a long way from Inazuma, though! Aren't you concerned that your shipment might get lost or stolen on the way?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 19.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No need to worry. I've already taken steps to ensure that it will arrive safely &mdash; I've entrusted the job to Komaniya Express's most reliable courier.

:{{Color|menu|At this moment, someone runs towards you...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Excuse me! Coming through, coming through!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' ...Chiori, your... Your shipment's here. I know it's quite late, so I'm... really... really sorry...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 20.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Deep breaths, Kirara &mdash; then start again.
;(If the player has not met Kirara before)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? And you're with customers as well? Oh geez... I've really kept everyone waiting. I'm so sorry, this is all my fault.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 21a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 21b.ogg}}--> '''Chiori:''' These two are {{Traveler}} and Paimon. With how well-traveled you are, you've probably heard of them already.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 22.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And this is Kirara, star courier of Komaniya Express. She's a nekomata, in case you were wondering about the tails.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Pleased to make your acquaintance, and sorry you had to see me like this! I know I'm late, but if an opportunity arises in the future, I still hope you'll choose the Komaniya Express!
;(If the player has met Kirara before)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhh, so Kirara's the courier you were talking about!
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh hey, {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Fancy seeing you here in Fontaine! It's been a while.
::{{DIcon}} It has indeed.
::{{DIcon}} How about a game of Genius Invokation TCG?
:::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 06b 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ahahaha... Maybe next time! Considering how late this delivery is, I'm not sure this is the time to play cards. Plus, I know this shipment is really important to Chiori, so I should probably make sure everything's in order...
::{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Wait a second... This is the second time that you've seen me flub a delivery job now, isn't it... You somehow always happen to catch me off my game, huh...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 23.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' So what was the hold up? Sailing delays? Bad weather?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? No, nothing like that... I just ran into a bit of trouble, that's all.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 24.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Bandits, then? Or Treasure Hoarders? Huh, a few run ins on the road aren't usually enough to give you any trouble...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 09.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uh... Well, I didn't run into anyone, exactly. I just got a little lost...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Your tails...
:{{Color|menu|Kirara may have spoken thusly, but her tails were twitching nonstop.}}
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 25.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Keeping you honest as always, I see.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 10.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 11.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Alright, alright... I was stopped by a group of bandits as soon as I entered Fontaine.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 12.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' They were a little different from the ones I usually run into. I could hear them mumbling about the Komaniya Express. It was obvious they were looking for someone with two tails...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So it was a targeted hit?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 13.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uh... I got the sense that they were actually targeting Chiori's goods.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 26.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' My fabric shipment?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 14.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yeah, they said that I could go as long as I left the goods with them. Otherwise, they'd stuff me into my delivery box and toss me into the sea to drown...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A&mdash;Are you okay, Kirara?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 15.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I'm good, I'm good! I'm still a youkai, after all. I turned them over to the Gardes. It just took me a while to round them all up...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 27.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, it's not completely out of the ordinary for one of your deliveries to get intercepted. But it still doesn't make sense how you knew it was my goods they were after. You've got other deliveries to make in Fontaine, don't you?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 28.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Is there something else that you're keeping from me?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 16.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh!? Um, well...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 29.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm... Perhaps I need to reconsider how many stars to give you in my review...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 17.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ah! You always know how to get me, Chiori! Alright, I'll talk, I'll talk...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 18.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' So... I kinda wanted to know why anyone would order a hit on me, so I spent a bit of time investigating.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 19.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' One of the bandits had a loose tongue, which saved me some time. He said that a certain person had commissioned them to intercept Chioriya Boutique's delivery.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 30.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And who might this person be?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 20.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uh, Chiori, why don't we just let this one go. I mean, I didn't really get injured, and you've still got Fashion Week to worry about...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 31.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I appreciate your kindness, Kirara, but if I don't teach this person a lesson, I doubt they'll stop here.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 32.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Anyone that dares to mess with one of my friends deserves a stern talking to and then some.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 21.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' ...Alright. The guy said that the commissioner was someone by the name of "Uther."
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 33.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Uther... Now, that name rings a bell, wouldn't you say, Kirara?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 22.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Well, that's exactly why I didn't want to bring it up to you...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, so you both know this Uther guy?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 23.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Through Chiori's complaints about him, sure. He's a fellow fashion designer who's made it his goal in life to make hers as miserable as possible.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So is he like... a business rival?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 34.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' A "rival" is what you call someone who fights you fair and square.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 35.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Uther, however, just has it out for me as a designer. He's publicly disparaged my design choices, my use of materials &mdash; he's practically tried every trick in the book to ruin my good name.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 36.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I've already warned him before to compete with me fair and square, but I guess he prefers playing dirty. Well, I'm more than happy to oblige...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 24.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Wait, Chiori, where are you going?
:{{Color|menu|After she finishes speaking, Chiori turns and leaves...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 chiori 37.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' To teach someone a lesson. You must be tired after your long journey &mdash; why don't you rest in my shop for a little while before heading back?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 25.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Chiori... Wait!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaand... She's gone{{sic}}
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 26.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh no... What should we do...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You seem concerned, Kirara... Should we be worried about Chiori?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 27.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Well, she's always been the type of person to face things head-on. But, with her fiery temper... I'm just worried whatever she's about to do will fuel negative publicity about her right before the start of Fashion Week.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 28.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, could you go after her and check out the situation for me? As a formal employee of the Komaniya Express, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to get involved.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We'll take good care of Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 2 kirara 29.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uh, well, to be honest... I'm more worried about that Uther guy's safety...

;(Talk to Kirara, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Anyway, please look after Chiori for me.

;(Interact with Fashion Week Promotional Poster, optional)
:'''Fashion Week Promotional Poster:''' The much-anticipated Fontaine Fashion Week has begun!
:'''Fashion Week Promotional Poster:''' Many renowned designers have gathered for this event. Their meticulously crafted, brand-new works will be on display during the final show.
:'''Fashion Week Promotional Poster:''' Let the light of fashion shine upon the City of the Arts!

;(Approach Chiori and Chevreuse)
;(If the player participated in the Roses and Muskets event)
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Any chance you're on the clock, Officer?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...Nothing good ever comes out of you addressing me like that.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Oh? And I see the Traveler and Paimon are here too.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chevreuse! We meet again!
::{{DIcon}} Are you out on patrol?
::{{DIcon}} Has everything been going well?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Well, things have been fine on my end. We were able to bring in a large number of recruits thanks to that film we made.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I suppose the trade off is that I'm now constantly getting stopped for autographs while out on patrol &mdash; not ideal if you ask me.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, well, you were one of the leading roles, after all!
;(If the player did not participate in the Roses and Muskets event{{Verify}})
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Oh? And who are these two?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, so you came, too.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, allow me to introduce you. These two are {{Traveler}} and Paimon. This officer over here is Chevreuse, captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The... The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol? You mean that organization where everyone carries a musket?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Well, I wouldn't say everyone on the Patrol uses a musket. I just happen to have formed a platoon made up mostly of musketeers.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Chiori, Paimon didn't know you went so far back with such a cool person!
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It's nothing. In my line of work, it's not uncommon to run into some trouble every now and then, and she's helped me get out of a few sticky situations.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' In return, I've helped her take care of some things that you could say aren't exactly in her purview as the captain of the Special Patrol... and that's how we got to know each other.
::{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It's nice to meet you both. I have to say, your reputation precedes you.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' So, did something happen?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Indeed it did. I'll need you to come with me.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...I only ever hear that phrase from you. Usually, I'm the one asking people to do that.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, are you coming?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not before I know what you're planning.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Have I ever made a bad call?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The better question is, have you ever made one that didn't violate proper procedure?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Okay, a man hired a group of bandits to mug my friend. I'm about to go teach him a lesson.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Are you sure this is something you should be telling the captain of the Special Patrol? It's getting hard to tell whether you're here to report a case or turn yourself in for one.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Neither. I'm requesting personal supervision from said captain so I don't do anything too out of line.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Are you planning to?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Not if I can help it.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Alright, where is this person?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Follow me.

;(Follow Chiori)
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chevreuse 16.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Just promise you'll start trying to keep yourself out of trouble.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 3 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, when trouble stops coming my way, I'll be sure to get on that.
----
;(Approach Uther's house)
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' This should be the place. You all wait here. I'll go have a chat with him.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know, Chevreuse, Paimon gets the sense that you two are actually pretty close.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It's just as Chiori said &mdash; we got to know each other pretty well in our lines of work... You could call it a "you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" sort of situation.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does Chiori often need your help?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Eh, I'd say it's mutual. The Special Patrol needs her help quite often as well. We've got tough problems of our own &mdash; getting people to talk, for example.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' The uniform, the musket, they're intimidating. Most people clam up the minute they see us, lips sealed so tight, getting them to talk almost feels like trying to break into the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But put them in a clothing boutique, and they suddenly start gushing faster than the waters at the Fountain of Lucine.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Is it because they're trying to show off or something?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yep. People are vain creatures &mdash; they can't help but want to talk up new developments in their lives, or show off how much they know about other people. And nothing brings out that sort of vanity quite like fashion.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' As a result, Chiori often picks up on all kinds of information in her shop. Most of her customers are members of the upper class, which means they're pretty much up to the gills in wealth and intel.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours... Paimon gets it now.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Exactly. I'm also here to ensure Chiori's safety. Those who make trouble for her also tend to be rich and powerful.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' And in some very rare cases... I'm forced to protect other people from Chiori herself.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' So, who got on her case this time? It's been a while since I last saw her that angry.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so this is what happened...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 10.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...Huh? Uther, you say?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've heard of him?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 11.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' He's made trouble for Chiori's several times already. He's fond of pretty much every dirty trick in the book. I heard that even the Maison Gardiennage issued him a warning due to his behavior.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 12.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...So, he's back at it, huh? His funeral, I guess.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, what's this about a funeral all of a sudden?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 13.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I just meant that Uther's done for. Now, bring it in, you two. Get right up close...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Ah, sure... But why?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 14.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Because this is probably going to turn into one of those "very rare cases" I just talked about...
:{{Color|menu|You hear a scream. It turns out it was Uther, who had just been thrown from the building and out onto the street...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 01.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Arghhhhh!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 02.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Wh&mdash;What are you doing? Stay away from me!
:{{Color|menu|Chiori steps forward, hauling him up by his collar...}}

:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Has anyone ever taught you... the definition of stupidity?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 03.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Stupidity... is doing the same meaningless thing over and over again.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It appears you've forgotten what I told you before, so allow me to refresh your memory &mdash; lay off the dirty tricks.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 04.ogg}} '''Uther:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh, and if you dare lay your hands on my friend again, you can expect a far less pleasant landing next time.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 15.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Ahem, Chiori...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmph...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 05.ogg}} '''Uther:''' Ah, Officer! An assault's in progress! Please, Officer, you've got to do something!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 16.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Of course. I'll do my utmost to investigate the situation. Unfortunately, I was chatting with this Traveler and seem to have missed what happened...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 17.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Not to worry, though. If you'd allow me to search the scene, I'm sure I'll be able to collect some useful evidence. You don't mind, do you? There's nothing in there that would implicate you in any illegal activity, I would hope...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 06.ogg}} '''Uther:''' I... Argh, forget it, it wasn't that big of a deal...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 18.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Ms. Chiori, I must also ask you to refrain from engaging in such disorderly conduct in the future, especially out in the open like this.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, apologies, Officer. I guess you could say I'm just used to tossing out any trash I come across on the street.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 07.ogg}} '''Uther:''' You...!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 19.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Is there anything else either of you have to say for yourselves?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That's all from me. I sincerely hope that today's events will never happen again.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 uther 08.ogg}} '''Uther:''' ...We'll see about that.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, that scared the heck out of Paimon! How did he just go... flying out like that?
:{{DIcon}} Such incredible strength...
:{{DIcon}} Such a graceful arc...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You're too kind.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 20.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Now's not the time to be accepting complements{{sic}}. What happened to not doing anything too out of line?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Not if I could help it is what I said &mdash; and I think I kept to that.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I started with a verbal warning, but he displayed neither shame nor remorse. If anything, he kept running his mouth with insults and threats.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 21.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Insults and threats so bad that he deserved to be tossed out like a sack of trash?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Believe it or not, they were that bad. He deserved to get knocked down a peg. It's the only way to get him to stop.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 22.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...You could have reported him to the Gardes.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh, I will, but it'll take some time for them to gather evidence, and he'd deny that he ever had anything to do with those bandits.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I don't want anything else to happen during Fontaine Fashion Week. On top of that, if Kirara's going to continue delivering goods for me, the least I can do is guarantee her safety.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 23.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, that reminds me &mdash; there's another favor I'd like to ask of you today.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 24.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' What a shame. I believe you've already used up your favor quota for the day.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Have I? Well, it's a good thing I was planning on taking an advance on tomorrow's quota then.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chevreuse 25.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' ...Don't you think you're maxed out on advances already?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I always pay you back in information, don't I?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 4 chiori 18.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It's just like you said &mdash; you scratch my back, and I scratch yours.

;(Approach Chioriya Boutique)
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We're back.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You were gone for an awfully long time! P&mdash;Please tell me nothing bad happened...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' There's nothing to worry about. All you need to know is that you'll never have to worry about someone in Fontaine messing with your deliveries again.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Sorry, Chiori... I didn't mean to cause you so much trouble.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' What are you talking about? You didn't do anything wrong. Those greedy bandits are to blame... along with a certain someone who doesn't know when to lay off the petty tricks.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' The next time you need to leave the city, call the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. They'll escort you half of the way, and the Spina di Rosula can take the second half...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' With that sort of escort, the next time you make a delivery, those Treasure Hoarders won't go anywhere near your goods... unless, of course, it's to offer to carry them for you.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ahahaha... Good one, Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I'm being serious. You know me &mdash; if I bring something up, you can assume it's already a done deal. You're going back to Inazuma tomorrow, right?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Wait, you don't mean&mdash;
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I've already spoken to the Captain of the Special Patrol. As discussed, the Patrol's going to take a small detour during their daily training tomorrow. As for Navia... I'll give her a heads-up in a bit.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' There's really no need! I'm just a simple courier! I don't need to be surrounded by a bunch of armed guards... or ones with sunglasses for that matter. Don't you think this is a bit much?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, you certainly shouldn't count on such a procession for every trip you make to Fontaine. It's just a one-off thing... for my own peace of mind.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It'll also show those guys what'll happen to those who dare to mess with my friends.
:{{DIcon}} Since she's already talked to the Patrol...
:{{DIcon}} Just think of it as a "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" type of situation...
::{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 10b 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes, well put.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Well, if you think it's a good idea, Traveler, then I guess it's fine...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, with the bad guys out of the way and your goods safely delivered, everything should be good to go for Fontaine Fashion Week, right?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I believe so. I'll try to churn out a few more outfits over the next few days. I've heard a lot of suppliers will be participating this year.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna take a guess and say suppliers are super important...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But of course. They supply us designers with funding, equipment, factory access... You have to work with them if you want to become a truly renowned fashion house.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That's also why this year's Fashion Week is so important to me.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' But isn't your brand already really famous, Chiori? Your clothes are so pretty and so nice to wear... I can't help but brag about them to my customers whenever I get the chance.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Even so, I would imagine there are still people who've never heard of the "Chioriya" brand, yes?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Weeeeelll... I mean, with the amount of places that I deliver to, it's only natural that some people from other nations haven't heard of it.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Then it's still not famous enough. My goal is to make the Chioriya brand renowned throughout all of Teyvat.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All of it!? Your business would have to get pretty huge, then!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 09.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Wait, would that mean I could just go to any Chioriya branch on the continent to get my clothes fixed? It has been pretty inconvenient, having to come to Fontaine every time I need to get them patched up...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Alternatively, of course, you could just be a bit more careful with them... They're already about as durable as I can make them.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 kirara 10.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hehe... okay I'll admit, they do get snagged on branches pretty often, but I can't help it! It's hard to be careful about that sort of thing when you're trying to take a nice nap in a tree...
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if that's your dream, Chiori, then we should do our best to make it a reality! Is there anything we can do to help out with Fashion Week?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm... I'm sure I could think of something.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, what is it? What is it?
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 18.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Why don't you come to my shop tomorrow and model for me? Simply put, you'll serve as my living mannequins.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So we get to try on some of your clothes? Got it!
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 19.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Seeing them off the rack will also give me the chance to make some small adjustments to the stitching and silhouette of the designs.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds easy enough!
:{{DIcon}} Do you need us for the runway, too?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 20a 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No need. We've already booked the models for that.
:{{DIcon}} Can we keep the outfits?
::{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 20b 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Most of the clothes you see during Fashion Week are meant to showcase the designer's vision. They're not exactly suitable for ready-to-wear use.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 21.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' If you like them, though, feel free to visit the boutique and see if anything catches your eye. I'll even give you a special discount.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, sounds great! Paimon was just starting to get curious about all of this design stuff.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 chiori 22.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Then we have a deal. You'll model some formal wear, {{Traveler}}, and... I dunno, Paimon here will show off some kids' designs. I'll see you both tomorrow then.
:{{A|vo qzlq001 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, sounds goo&mdash; Wait... Kids clothes? Paimon told you already. She's not a little kid!

;(Talk to Chiori or Kirara, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Speaking of clothes... Do yours happen to need any mending right now, Kirara?
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ehehehe... Well since you asked, Chiori, there's this part around my waist...
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh? Need a bit of letting out around the middle?
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq001 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' No! It's a tear! Those bad guys did it!
