{{Lang|'''Ji Tong'''|zh=季同|zh_rm=Jì Tóng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that first appeared in the ''[[Five Flushes of Fortune]]'' event. Until the World Quest ''[[Perfect Shot]]'' is completed, he can be found on the docks' street market, a couple meters north of the [[Liyue Harbor]]'s northern [[Teleport Waypoint]].

During the ''Five Flushes of Fortune'' event, he gives the [[Kurious Kamera]] gadget, which can be used to take pictures of certain objects, randomly giving the traveler a tinted picture. Collecting all tints and talking to Ji Tong will reward the player with a [[Five Flushes of Fortune#Fortune Trove|Fortune Trove]], which contains guaranteed [[Primogem]]s, and possibly [[Mora]], [[Hero's Wit]], and [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]].
