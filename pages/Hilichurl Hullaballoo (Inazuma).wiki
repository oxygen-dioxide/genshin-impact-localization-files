'''''Hilichurl Hullaballoo''''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
#Defeat the Hilichurls

==Request Details==
===Request from Furuya Noboru===
{{Quest Description|The hilichurls are causing chaos somewhere on [[Narukami Island]]. [[Furuya Noboru]] hopes that someone can put a stop to this quickly.}}
Help Needed:<br>
The Guild has received a number of escort commissions that seem to stem from chaos caused by {{Color|buzzword|Hilichurls somewhere on Narukami Island}}.<br>
The adventurers are all busy with their commissions and we can't spare the people at the moment, so it would be great if someone could help cut this problem off at the source.

===Request from Utsumi===
{{Quest Description|The hilichurls are causing chaos somewhere in [[Kannazuka]]. [[Utsumi]] hopes that someone can put a stop to this quickly.}}
Help Needed:<br>
Monsters have become more active in Kannazuka lately. If you don't watch it, you'll get attacked by hilichurls.<br>
I won't stand for such things. That is where my son is buried. How can he rest in peace with all the racket those Hilichurls are making?<br>
Someone, please take up a father's plea, and drive those {{Color|buzzword|hilichurls}} making trouble in Kannazuka away!

==Enemies==
===Request from Furuya Noboru===
* Wave 1 {{Enemy List|Electro Abyss Mage;Pyro Hilichurl Shooter*3}}
* Wave 2 {{Enemy List|Pyro Abyss Mage;Electro Samachurl*2}}

===Request from Utsumi===
{{Enemy List|Thunderhelm Lawachurl}}
* The two samachurls will appear when the lawachurl reaches ~50% of its HP. {{Enemy List|Hydro Samachurl*2}}

==Trivia==
* Upon completing [[Utsumi]]'s variant of the request, the [[Thunderhelm Lawachurl]] and objects that were normally there will appear with no delay.
