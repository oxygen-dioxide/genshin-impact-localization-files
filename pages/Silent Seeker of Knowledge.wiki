==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|According to Tighnari, the [[Akademiya]] researcher Haypasia, who lives alone in the forest, is the real ideal person to direct [[Irminsul]]-related queries to.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Enter the cave)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hellooo? Haypasia? Hey, there's nobody here...
:{{A|vo xmaq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, maybe she went out to look for some food. Let's try looking around the area!
;(Paimon turns around and leaves the cave)
:<!--Aranara walking sound-->'''Faint Sound:''' Clatter...
:{{DIcon}} (What was that sound?)
:{{DIcon}} (It sounds like it's coming from inside the cave...)
;(Traveler walks further into the cave and looks around)
:'''(Traveler):''' (It's Haypasia! Is she okay?)
;(The Traveler and [[Aranara|a mysterious little creature]] walk toward Haypasia at the same time from different angles and see each other upon nearing Haypasia)
:{{color|menu|You run into the curious being again and have given it quite a fright.}}
:{{A|vo xmaq004 2 aranaraa 02.ogg}} '''???:''' !?
;(The mysterious little creature leaps into the air)
:;(A scene transition occurs<!--entering domain-->)
;(Paimon returns)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There you are.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haypasia! Are you alright?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 3 haypasia 01.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Uh, ughhh... So hungry... *cough* Need... water...
:{{DIcon}} She looks famished!
:{{DIcon}} She somehow has more energy than I expected.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's no way we can get her to eat in her current condition. Let's try finding some water first.
;(The Traveler and Paimon turn around)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait! Why does it look super foggy outside all of a sudden? Anyway, let's go look around!

;(Check Haypasia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq004 haypasia 01.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' So... hungry...

;(Exit the cave)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? How'd things out here end up looking like this?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What happened!? And where are we?
:{{DIcon}} Relax, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} There must be a logical explanation for all this.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Oh, maybe you're right... Let's go investigate the area.

;(Follow the path and approach the central opening)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, this place is huge!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knew there's something off about that cave! Let's think of a way to get over there and have a closer look. Who knows, maybe we'll find a lead of some kind!

;(Approach the marked location)
:;(A scene transition with a starry sky occurs, bringing the player to an Inazuma-styled building)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, what happened just now? Why did everything around us suddenly change?

;(Approach the room at the end of the hall)
:;(A scene transition with a starry sky occurs, bringing the player back to the tree hollows)

;(Enter the [[Primeval Rosin]]-locked entrance)
:;(A scene transition with a starry sky occurs, bringing the player to another Inazuma-styled building)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What in Teyvat is going on here!? This place is getting weirder by the minute!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what's the matter? You don't look so good...

;(Walk through the hall after riding the elevator up)
:;(A scene transition with a starry sky occurs, bringing the player back to the tree hollows)
----
;(Approach the upper platform)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 01.ogg}} '''Abyss Herald:''' Hahaha! Well, well, well. Looks like we meet again, Traveler!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! The Abyss Herald! What are you plotting to do in this strange place?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 02.ogg}} '''Abyss Herald:''' Strange place? Plotting? Hehehe... You needn't worry about such things, they don't concern you!
<!--;({{tx|Unused line}})
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{tx|Ugh, let's take this guy down! If he doesn't wanna tell us, then we'll have to beat it out of him!}}-->

;(Around 20 seconds after the Abyss Herald initiates Dark Descent)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wh&mdash;Why can't we beat this guy...? Paimon doesn't get it. We've faced others like him before &mdash; what's wrong this time?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 03.ogg}} '''Abyss Herald:''' Traveler, though you may have managed to avert countless crises before, your good fortune was bound to end sooner or later. It's time you realize how weak and powerless you really are!
:{{DIcon}} My journey will not end here!
:{{DIcon}} I still must find my {{MC|sister|brother}}!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 04b.ogg}} '''Abyss Herald:''' Your {{MC|sister|brother}}? Mwahahaha! Oh, pitiful Traveler, are you really so ignorant? Or are you just living in complete denial?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 05b.ogg}} '''Abyss Herald:''' {{MC|Her|His}} Highness has long since forsaken you. Your meager existence in {{MC|her|his}} eyes is that of an annoying bug only to be stepped upon!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 06.ogg}} '''Abyss Herald:''' The bonds of love and family which drive you to find your sibling are utterly gone! Your journey is meaningless!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 4 heraldwater 07.ogg}} '''Abyss Herald:''' But don't you fret now. Today will be your last. Now die!
:;(A scene transition occurs)
----
:'''(Traveler):''' Ugh! Huh...
:'''(Traveler):''' (What was all that just now? Strange... It feels like I was just dreaming for a moment there, but I can't remember what I saw...)
;(Paimon returns)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, what do we do? We haven't seen Haypasia anywhere out here...
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, there she is! Quick, let's see how she's doing.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 01.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' So sweet... Mmm...
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, the good news is that she's still conscious. Hey! Why'd you drop her food on the floor like that!?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I uh... kinda zoned out for a second there.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, are you okay? That's really not like you...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, seeing Haypasia must have given me a shock.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, guess that makes sense... She does look kinda rough at the moment.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyways, we can talk about this later. We'd better make sure she's alright first.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, wait a sec! Look at all this fruit lying around her. We can put that to good use!

:'''After giving the semi-conscious Haypasia some water and fruit juice...'''

:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 02.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Ugh... Who's there!? [[Tighnari]], is that you? Ah!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 03.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's okay, you can relax, Haypasia. Tighnari sent us here to bring you some food and water. Here, we have a letter that he asked us to give you.

:'''You give Haypasia the letter from Tighnari.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 04.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I see, so you're friends of Tighnari. I apologize for all the trouble I've caused you.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 05.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I'm grateful that you came so quickly to save me. You even brought all this fruit.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh well, actually, we didn't bring the fruit. It was already here when we arrived.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were kinda wondering about that, actually. When we found you here, there was all this fruit lying around and even some juice dripping from your lips... Uh, how did you end up like this anyway?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 06.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Oh? Really?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 07.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Hmm, I seem to understand now. All the fruit was likely from my, uh... neighbor. Must have come by and saw me like this.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your neighbor? You mean there's someone else living nearby?
:{{DIcon}} Is it a little round creature?
:{{DIcon}} Kind of like... a cabbage?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 08.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Oh? So you're able to see them, too?

:'''You tell Haypasia and Paimon everything that happened after entering the cave.'''

::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you came across an Aranara here, and they caused you to have a dream.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 09.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Ah, so that's what they're called... An Aranara. So... not only can you see those creatures, but you're quite familiar with them, too.
::{{DIcon}} Yes, we've bumped into them before.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just out of curiosity, Haypasia, how is it that you see the Aranara, but don't know anything about them? You didn't even know what they were called.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 10.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Ah, well you see, they've never actually spoken with me directly, and I've never asked anyone about them... Though, I did begin to sense that these Aranara, as you call them, have some sort of deeper connection with the Dendro Archon.

:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, hold on a second, Traveler! You say that {{sic|before we arrived}}, you saw some mysterious creature and suddenly had a strange dream? Isn't that a little too crazy to believe?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 11.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' No, I actually do believe what the Traveler is saying. I myself had a similar experience once before and ended up scaring my timid, little neighbor here.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 12.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' You needn't worry &mdash; he means you no harm. He only dragged you into the dream because he hoped to buy himself a little time in order to scurry away.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Haypasia, just what kind of creature is your neighbor exactly?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 13.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I'm not sure what it's called, to be honest... But I do know that they have some sort of deeper connection with the Dendro Archon.<!-- this is the last line in this branch, if it turns out that the commented-out branch exists in-game -->
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 14.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I know this because the first time I saw them was also the exact day my consciousness was able to form a connection with Irminsul.
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 15.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Even after I opened my eyes and stopped meditating, my heart was still pounding and my mind was racing with all the knowledge that I had touched.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 16.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' And at that very moment, I suddenly noticed a small figure at the opening of the cave.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 17.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' In my curiosity, I began to walk over to the creature. They must have already been used to me living in the cave, because they didn't seem to mind me approaching them. They just kept doing whatever they were up to.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 18.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' It wasn't until I crouched down next to them that they suddenly realized that I could see them.
;(The flashback ends)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and then?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 19.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' And then, I had a dream... By the time I came to, they were nowhere to be seen.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 20.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I was convinced they'd never show up again, but sure enough, I saw them nearby a few days later... and they weren't alone.

::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it, you must have startled them.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 21.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Hehe, yes, apparently I did. I admit that I still feel guilty about that...
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 22.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Given that you're familiar with the Aranara, you probably already know that they don't have ill intentions when forcing you into dreams. They only do so to give themselves a chance to run away.
::{{DIcon}} Yes, that's what thought, too.
::{{DIcon}} It's because the Aranara are very timid creatures.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, Haypasia, the fact that the nearby Aranara not only often appear around you but also came to your rescue shows that they've taken a real liking to you.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon bets it won't be long before your neighbor starts talking to you and becomes your close friend.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 23.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Thank you, I hope that day comes soon. Ah, before I forget, Tighnari mentioned in his letter that you have questions for me regarding Irminsul...?

:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a great neighbor.

:'''A Curious Sound:''' *rumbling*<!-- stomach grow sfx -->
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 27.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Ehehe... Sorry about that. Sounds like just drinking juice still isn't quite enough for my stomach.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if somebody hadn't dropped the food earlier...! Ugh, anyway, looks like we'll need to prepare something ourselves. Besides, Paimon's getting hungry too! Let's eat first and talk about Irminsul later.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, we're up, Traveler! Today's menu will feature [[Sweet Madame]] and a [[Radish Veggie Soup]]! You'll love them, Haypasia. They're our specialties, after all!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 5 haypasia 28.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' *drooling* Oh, I've never tried any dishes from other nations before. I certainly look forward to it! It's been so long since I've had a decent meal, too. To be honest, the last time had to be when Tighnari came to visit.
----
;(Interact with the campfire pot)
:'''You cook up some dishes over the fire.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All done! Let's use the empty box that Tighnari gave us since we already washed it.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhh, it smells amazing! And the box is a nice touch, too. Let's go serve this up and start eating with Haypasia!
;(Obtain [[Box Lunch from the Traveler]])

;(Talk to Haypasia)<!-- can also be done before you cook, and yes she still says it smells delicious without you cooking -->
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 01.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Are you already finished cooking? Mmmm, smells delectable! I'm truly thankful whenever I can enjoy a proper meal like this. Cooking really isn't my forte...
;(Open item menu)

:'''After a delicious meal together, you tell Haypasia about connecting with Irminsul...'''

:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 02.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Even though everything you mentioned was in Tighnari's letter, it's still hard to believe you were able to connect with Irminsul... immediately after smelling [[Spirit Borneol]] for the first time.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 03.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' It took me nearly three years before I could do so... And everyone at the [[Akademiya]] even lauded me as a genius.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 04.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' You should know that some researchers spend their entire lives without ever successfully connecting with Irminsul as you have.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So why does this incense allow people to connect to Irminsul?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 05.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' The ingredients used to make Spirit Borneol primarily consist of plants created by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]. These special ingredients are conducive to heightening our senses to the Dendro Archon's power.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 06.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Since the root of the Dendro Archon's power lies within Irminsul, we can occasionally tap into her powers to peer into the depths of the earth.
:{{DIcon}} I think I understand.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 07a.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Naturally. Anyone who can establish a connection with Irminsul on their first ever attempt must be a person of great understanding.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, you lost me there...
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 07b.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' That's alright, I'm sure you'll come to a clearer understanding as you remain in [[Sumeru]].
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, makes sense... But Paimon's got a question! Why was {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} sensitive to the smell of those plants for such a long time?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 08a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 08b.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' That was primarily due to {{MC|his|her|mc=1}} body's unique constitution. Stimulated by the incense, {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} could perceive the Dendro Archon's power and experienced a sensory overload, hence the adverse reactions.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 09.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Taking in any scent similar to the ingredients of Spirit Borneol would cause adverse effects.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 10.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Not to worry, though. It appears you have already fully recovered.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 11.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Technically, your body should still be sensitive to the powers of the Dendro Archon, but unless you are using intentional meditation techniques, the scent of Spirit Borneol should no longer trigger such reactions.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, well that's a relief.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 12.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I must admit, I am quite envious of your abilities. Even if it meant suffering from pounding headaches for the rest of my life, I'd consider it worthwhile so long as I could connect with Irminsul at will.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you're really serious about this whole thing, aren't you?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 13.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Haha, I am a researcher, after all.
;(Camera pans to show the mysterious little creature at the entrance of the cave)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 14.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' As a member of the [[Rtawahist]] [[Darshan]] at the Akademiya, my main area of research is the stars and their connection to the fate of living beings. But there is still so much we don't know, especially regarding the mysteries that lie in the starry skies.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 15.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Which is why I must turn to the all-knowing Irminsul for answers.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 16.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' If only my perception wasn't so limited... Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee that my every attempt to attune with Irminsul will be successful, or that doing so will leave my consciousness intact.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 17.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I am currently in the stage of training known as "[[Satyavada Life]]." Many researchers in Sumeru have lost their minds while seeking to attune with Irminsul during this stage.
;(Camera pans to show the mysterious little creature, still at the cave's entrance)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 18.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Sages have said that Irminsul contains divine knowledge, and touching such knowledge without the proper preparations and abilities will only lead to one's mind caving in on itself.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 19.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' That's why we meditate alone. We need to ensure that our minds will be calm while minimizing the possibility of involving anyone else.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, so knowledge from Irminsul can be super dangerous! Don't you ever feel afraid of the risk, Haypasia?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 20.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Of course I do, especially during nights that are pitch black with no moonlight, and dead silent without even the sound of insects.
;(Haypasia turns to the cave entrance)
;(The mysterious little creature jumps and disappears)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 21.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' However, I've been feeling better as of late. I don't get as scared anymore knowing that I have a little neighbor living nearby.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 22.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I believe that being able to see them is a sort of blessing from the Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 23.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Heh, but what's strangest of all is that they're clearly an envoy of the God of Wisdom herself, and they have the curious power to make people dream.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's so strange about that? It doesn't sound so out of place for a divine being, does it?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 24.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Well, it's strange because nearly nobody in Sumeru can ever dream.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is that true?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 25.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Yes... Well, to an extent. Only children can dream in Sumeru. Adults, however, never do.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 26.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' The sages say that wisdom implies rationality, but that which occurs in dreams is often neither rational nor logical.
:{{DIcon}} Reminds me of the dream I saw from the {{sic|[[Aranara]]}}...
:{{DIcon}} It was a big, chaotic mess...
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 27.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Yes, if one struggles with anxieties, those emotions could influence their dreams.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 28.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' The fact that the people of Sumeru do not have dreams is seen as a blessing by the sages. They believe that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, the God of Wisdom, is keeping us away from the foolish delusions you encounter in your sleep.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 29.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I was born into a family of scholars in Sumeru City. Ever since I was a child, my parents would always tell me that I'll know I've grown up once I stop dreaming.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 30.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I studied hard, enrolled as a student in the Akademiya, and went on to become a researcher. *sigh* Sure enough, I never dreamed again.
;(Camera pans to show the mysterious little creature in vegetation)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 31.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' But then, on the day I scared the little {{sic|Aranara}}... I suddenly saw a dream again.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 32.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' It was incredible. Though I don't exactly remember what I saw, I clearly recall the feeling... I suddenly felt like I was a child again.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 33.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Back then, I was foolish and ignorant as any youth would be, but I was free of fear... Maybe dreaming isn't as bad as we've made it out to be.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 34.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Ahem... Just be sure not to speak of this if you travel to [[Sumeru City]]. They'll look at you as if you've lost your mind.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 08a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 08b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So do you have any thoughts about the things {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} saw when {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} connected with Irminsul?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 35.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have any answers as of now. All I can say is that what you saw is a memory contained within Irminsul itself.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 36.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Hmm... "world... forget me..." What could that possibly mean?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 37.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Agh, if only I could ascend past Satyavada Life and begin [[Paripurna Life]], I might have some more answers for you.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 38.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' *sigh* If you two are ever in the area again, please be sure to come and see me.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Haypasia!
:{{DIcon}} We wish you luck in your endeavors.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 39.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' There's no need to be thanking me, you two are my saviors! Besides, I'm already looking forward to tasting some more of your cooking, hehe.

:'''You continue chatting before settling down for a good night's rest.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq004 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that we know Haypasia is alright and had the chance to ask her some questions, Paimon thinks it's about time to head back to [[Gandharva Ville]].

;(Talk to Haypasia)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq004 haypasia 02.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Heading out, I see? If there's anything else you'd ever like to ask about, you know where to find me.
:{{DIcon}} About dreams...
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40a.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Even though that little neighbor of mine was able to induce a state of dreaming, I doubt they were able to control the actual contents of the dream.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40a 1.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' The end of your dream seemed quite terrifying. Perhaps there's something that's troubling you deep inside...?
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40a 2.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Not to worry, though, I'm sure you'll be able to handle whatever comes your way in the real world.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40a 3.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' As someone from Sumeru who cannot dream, I needn't ever worry about nightmares. But lately, I've started to feel that I'm somehow missing something without dreams... Hehe, it's a little hard to explain.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Irminsul...
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40b.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Sumeru researchers use Spirit Borneol to assist them in connecting with Irminsul to extract knowledge from it. Though the process can be risky, we believe that the knowledge gained is worth it.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40b 1.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Unfortunately, I cannot help you understand your dream, at least not yet. I'm still learning how to attune to the depths of Irminsul myself.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40b 2.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I hope that I'll be able to ascend past Satyavada Life and gain deeper insights.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About your unusual neighbor...
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40c.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I've heard local children here in the rainforest speaking of fairy-like creatures, but I'm from Sumeru City, and I've never heard of such things when I was a child.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40c 1.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Perhaps this is because I had a very strict upbringing. My parents would seldom allow me to play with other children. I doubt they'd ever believe me if I told them about my little neighbor out here.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40c 2.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' And speaking of my little neighbor, I think they can somehow sense when Tighnari is coming to visit me.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40c 3.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' I've noticed on several occasions that as they're playing under the trees, they'll suddenly tense up and scamper away for no apparent reason. Shortly after they do this, Tighnari always shows up here.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40c 4.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Hmm, perhaps I should ask Tighnari about this the next time I see him...
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 7 haypasia 40d.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Take care. Do remember to come visit anytime you're in the area. I would be happy to chat with you.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 ghulam 01.ogg}} '''Ghulam:''' Think about it, Tighnari, refusing to join is tantamount to burying your head in the sand!
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 ghulam 02.ogg}} '''Ghulam:''' I understand that you're a Forest Watcher and that it's your duty to combat the effects of [[Withering Zone]]s, but isn't it evident that such work is not a lasting solution to the problem?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 ghulam 03.ogg}} '''Ghulam:''' As Sage Khajeh clearly stated, your presence and guidance in Sumeru City is pivotal in finding a cure for Irminsul. How could you possibly refuse!?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 khajeh 01.ogg}} '''Khajeh:''' Keep your emotions in check, Ghulam. Let's at least listen to Tighnari's reason for declining. We're here to invite him to the Akademiya, not to cause a scene.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Sage Khajeh, I am truly honored that you came here in person, but I'm afraid I must still decline your invitation.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I am merely a Forest Watcher. How could the great minds of the [[Haravatat]] have any need of someone like me?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 khajeh 02.ogg}} '''Khajeh:''' Haha, well it turns out that your refusal letter had some implications on your master's reputation. He is a renowned Sage of the [[Amurta]], after all. So now, I've come here in his stead.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I see. Huh, and I figured that, given his temper, he would come here and berate me personally.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 khajeh 03.ogg}} '''Khajeh:''' Tighnari, your master is an integral part of this effort, and now he requires your assistance.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' And what exactly does my master need of me, Sage Khajeh?
;(Khajeh and Ghulam exchange looks)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 khajeh 04.ogg}} '''Khajeh:''' You'll know, once you've arrived in Sumeru City, that is.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' And how long will I be required to stay?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 khajeh 05.ogg}} '''Khajeh:''' There's no definite answer as of now.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Do you mean to tell me that despite coming all the way here to Gandharva Ville, you still can't answer the questions I laid out in the letter to my master?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' If that's the case, then I'm afraid I cannot give you a definite answer either.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 ghulam 04.ogg}} '''Ghulam:''' Tighnari! But you&mdash;
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 khajeh 06.ogg}} '''Khajeh:''' *sigh* So be it... Come, Ghulam, we're leaving.
:{{color|menu|Ghulam, Khajeh, and others take their leave.}}
;(The Traveler walks past the departing group as only Khajeh and Ghulam look at the Traveler)
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh Tighnari, what was that all about?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It's nothing. Some people from the Akademiya wanted me to go to Sumeru City to assist them with a project, but I had to refuse on account of all my responsibilities here.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' But all that can wait, how did things go with Haypasia?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It was quite the eventful trip! But the main thing is that she's safe and sound. She answered a bunch of questions for us, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Very good. Now that (Traveler) has made a full recovery, there shouldn't be any reason for you to tarry here longer. I assume you will be heading to Sumeru City, correct?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! We want to meet [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] and ask her for advice. Do you have any idea on how we can find her?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have any advice for you there.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, do you at least know anyone we can try asking in Sumeru City?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hmm, let me think... My trips to Sumeru City have been fairly short, and most of my acquaintances are researchers...
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' How about this... I'll write you a letter of introduction that you can give to a researcher I know. He's from the Amurta Darshan and is adept at gathering information. Asking him might prove worthwhile.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Also, when you enter Sumeru City, you'll probably end up receiving something like this item here. I'm not sure if it will ever come in handy for you, but maybe you can give it a try.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? What is it?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 15.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It's called an [[Akasha Terminal]]. It's a tool produced by the Akademiya that utilizes the legacy of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. Some say that this very item is the basis of Sumeru's reputation as the City of Wisdom.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 16.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Needless to say, this device and its usage fall under the Akademiya's expertise, so I'll leave it to them to show you how to use it.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Next stop, Sumeru City! Ah, but wait, before that...
:{{DIcon}} We need to say goodbye to Collei.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! Tighnari, we have something important to say to Collei before we leave. Is she doing better now?
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 17.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yes, she's doing much better. After being confined to her bed all this time, I thought a little walk would do her some good. Last I saw her, she was taking the path towards the north crossing.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 18.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' She knew you two would be leaving soon, so she must have wanted to see you off.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Tighnari! Alright, let's go.
:{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 19.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Farewell, and good luck to you both.

::{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 20b 1.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' But I can't afford to leave Gandharva Ville now. Things are not going well here in the rainforest, and Collei needs someone to watch over her. Besides, I never was one for all the pomp and circumstance of life at the Akademiya.
::{{A|vo xmaq004 8 tighnari 20b 2.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Given that my master hasn't come to give me an earful personally, it seems that my presence is not as sorely needed as they make it out to be. In fact, the letter he sent to me was uncharacteristically polite...

:{{A|vo xmaq004 9 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' And uh, well I'm sorry... I should have told you both about my condition when we first met. I just wanted you two to treat me as a normal friend, not some girl that needs your sympathy...
