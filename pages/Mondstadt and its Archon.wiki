==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Now that [[Mondstadt]] has been spared from disaster, Sister [[Grace]] would like to offer her thanks to the Anemo Archon for its protection of the city.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Grace)
:'''Grace:''' Thanks be to the Anemo Archon...
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
:'''Grace:''' I'm praying to Lord Barbatos. It was by his protection that Mondstadt was able to weather this storm.
:'''Grace:''' We also have him to thank for the safety of the Knights of Favonius and the adventurers of the Guild.
:'''Grace:''' Thank you, Lord Barbatos...
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Lord Barbatos...
:{{DIcon}} ...How hardworking of him.
:'''Grace:''' I dare not fathom the things Lord Barbatos has done for us.
:'''Grace:''' But just knowing that such a diligent deity watches over Mondstadt sets my heart at ease.
:'''Grace:''' Ah, yes. If you have some time, could you do me a favor?
:'''Grace:''' I'd like you to help me collect one batch of Dandelion Seeds, and scatter them to the winds at the top of the Anemo Archon Statue...
:{{DIcon}} I think I've heard of this one...
::'''Grace:''' Oh, but didn't you help [[Glory]] scatter Dandelion Seeds in the same manner before? Did you forget?
:{{DIcon}} Why is it done?
:'''Grace:''' Dandelion Seeds that go with the wind carry the feelings in our hearts with them, whether that feeling is remembrance, or thanksgiving.
:'''Grace:''' Lord Barbatos is the Anemo Archon, so it is most fitting to use these Dandelion Seeds to express our thanks to him.
:{{DIcon}} Allow me, then.
::'''Grace:''' Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} Are Dandelion Seeds all you need?
::'''Grace:''' Yes, they will suffice. The other flowers in Mondstadt do not scatter in to the distance very well, in any case.
::'''Grace:''' So please do help me get a batch of Dandelion Seeds. I will wait here for you.
----
;(Return to Grace)
:'''Grace:''' Have you gathered the Dandelion Seeds?
:{{DIcon}} Have them right here.
:'''Grace:''' These should be enough. Please wait here for a moment...
:'''Grace:''' ...Lord Barbatos, please hear me...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, she's so... devout. So... many words...
:'''Paimon:''' Who knows if that Tone-Deaf Bard is listening...
:'''Grace:''' Alright. Please take these Dandelion Seeds. Help me go up and scatter them.
:'''Grace:''' I should really do this myself, but with my physical abilities... I would probably have a hard time getting back down, even if I could climb up there.
:'''Grace:''' So I'm counting on you.

;(Talk to Grace again)
:'''Grace:''' Lord Barbatos, I hope that you can hear me...
----
;(After scattering the seeds)
:'''Grace:''' Have you scattered the Dandelion Seeds?
:{{DIcon}} I've just done that.
:{{DIcon}} The wind will carry them far abroad.
::'''Grace:''' That's wonderful. It should be easy for Lord Barbatos to notice.
:'''Grace:''' Regardless, I do hope that Lord Barbatos will be able to hear my voice.
:'''Grace:''' Thank you for your willingness to help. Please take this for your troubles &mdash; and may the Anemo Archon protect you.
