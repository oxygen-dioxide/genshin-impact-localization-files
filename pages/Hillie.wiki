'''Hillie''' is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Dawn Winery]], [[Mondstadt]]. She can be seen with her fellow maid [[Moco]]. In the morning, they are outside the winery; at night, they are inside the manor.

She is always talking to Moco, and head maid [[Adelinde]] is often less-than-pleased with their work, which perhaps stems from their tendency to chatter. They have two versions of their dialogue, which play at random.

==Dialogue==
===Version 1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Moco:''' D'you know what?
:'''Hillie:''' No, what?
:'''Moco:''' We have one less key than Adeline... uh-huh...
:'''Hillie:''' *gasp* Does that mean... There's a secret room?
:'''Moco:''' Right! You got it!
:'''Moco:''' And so this one time, when I was waxing the floors, I noticed that right down the far end of the corridor on the second floor... there's a hidden room!
:'''Hillie:''' Really!? So that's really the room that...?
:'''Moco:''' Well. I crept up to the door and as soon as I got close, I heard this "thud... thud... thud" sound getting closer and closer!
:'''Moco:''' I was like, sooo scared... and then just as I was about to run away... Adeline was behind me!
:'''Hillie:''' Yikes!
:'''Moco:''' The weirdest thing is that she didn't even tell me off; instead, she was all polite and asked me nicely to go back to my room...
:'''Moco:''' But when I got back to my room, that's when I realized--
:'''Moco:''' That thudding sound... it was exactly like how Adeline's boots sound when she walks!

===Version 2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Moco:''' *gasp* No way... So that guest really?
:'''Hillie:''' Totally! Shh...Not so loud!
:'''Hillie:''' I was on duty that morning, and it seemed like no one had left.
:'''Hillie:''' But I cleaned all the guest rooms on the second floor, and guess what I noticed? All the rooms were empty...
:'''Moco:''' *gasp* No. Friggin'. Way! That's sooo creepy... So what happened then?
:'''Hillie:''' Then I asked Adelinde... Like hey, what happened to the guest who arrived last night!?
:'''Hillie:''' And she totally ignored me! She was just like, watering the flowers in the garden and talking to herself...
:'''Moco:''' What was she saying?
:'''Hillie:''' She was all like, "Next year when these flowers are in season they will look gorgeous."
