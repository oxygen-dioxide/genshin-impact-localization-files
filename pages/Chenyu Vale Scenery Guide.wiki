What would you say the best scenic attraction in [[Chenyu Vale]] is?<br>
...<br>
It's gotta be my hometown, [[Qiaoying Village]]. Not only are the sights amazing, but the animals there are super cute! I recommend going in the afternoon!<br>
...<br>
(Location that has been crossed out.)<br>
...<br>
The [[Jademouth]]! A life lived without visiting it is surely one with regrets, especially that gemstone orb. When you look at it in the morning, it's like a moon that has yet to set.<br>
...<br>
(Location that has been crossed out.)<br>
...<br>
The Lotus Pond next to the Ancient Teatree King may not be that famous, but I find it to have a serene beauty at night. You just have to be careful of the monsters nearby.<br>
...<br>
(Location that has been crossed out.)<br>
...<br>
If you ask me, it's gotta be... [[Mt. Xuanlian]], right? You rarely see such strange mountains anywhere else, and sunset there is truly moving.<br>
...<br>
(There are other locations written in the guide, but they've also been crossed out.)
