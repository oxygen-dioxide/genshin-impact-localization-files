'''Confused Aranara''' are part of the [[Aranara]] located in various areas of [[Dharma Forest]], [[Sumeru]].

There is a total of 14 Confused Aranara. They will only appear after completing the World Quest ''[[The World of Aranara]]''. They appear in a daze in odd locations, often inside an Aranara hut, sitting in a hunched position. They can be awakened by applying {{Color|Dendro}} onto them. Afterward, if they are interacted with, they will either reward 5,000 [[Mora]] and a Sumeru [[Material]] x3, or [[Adventurer's Experience]] x4, and also leave a one-time investigation point behind.
