'''Consecrated Beasts''' are an [[Elite Enemy|Elite]] enemy group. While most can be found in the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], [[Sumeru]], a lone beast can be found in [[Yashiori Island]], [[Inazuma]].

They are [[wildlife]] that have grown larger and stronger as a result of mutations from eating greater lifeforms, such as [[god]]s.

In combat, they will enter a Phagocytic Form which increases their [[RES]] and perform aggressive and high-damage elemental attacks. They will periodically exit this state to perform a special attack and spawn a Phagocytic Energy Block, which the player can destroy using elemental attacks and use to paralyze the beast.
