{{Description|A lifeform that became twisted and warped by eating some great being.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

'''Consecrated Beasts''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group. While the majority can be found in [[Sumeru]], they can also be found in [[Inazuma]] and [[Fontaine]].

They are [[wildlife]] that have grown larger and stronger as a result of mutations from eating greater lifeforms, such as [[god]]s and surviving the highly painful process. As a result of being unable to fully consume said lifeforms, they have grown bone-like features across their bodies.

In combat, they perform aggressive and high-damage elemental attacks. Upon spotting a player, they will immediately enter a Phagocytic Form, which increases their [[RES]]. They will periodically exit this state to perform a special attack and spawn a Phagocytic Energy Block, which the player can destroy using elemental attacks and use to paralyze the beast temporarily and cause it to lose a portion of its HP.
