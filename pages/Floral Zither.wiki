|description  = A musical instrument that can be used in performances.<br>It is made of rather unique materials, and its craftsmanship is quite different from the designs that are currently in vogue. An unpredictable strength has been woven into the ethereal strings that can even allow it to cause the illusions within the heart of its player to surface.<br>There is an old adage in Liyue: "the longer one's eye of the flower drinks, the deeper one's heart into the mire sinks." It seems that only the strong-willed may use this instrument.

The '''Floral Zither''' is a [[Gadget]] that can be purchased from [[Granny Shan]]. It was previously obtainable after scoring 600 points in "Where to Next?" on Normal Mode during the [[Tuned to the World's Sounds]] Event.

The zither has a {{w|Range (music)|range}} from C3 to B5 and does not have sharp or flat notes.
Notes are labeled with {{w|solfège}} syllables rather than note names, with C as ''do''. Multiple notes can be played simultaneously, but notes cannot be held, as expected of a plucked instrument.

==Usage==
Just like the [[Windsong Lyre]], the zither can be played on PC using either the keyboard or the mouse. On the keyboard, the top row of notes (treble clef, 𝄞) are mapped to the letters {{key|Q}} to {{key|U}}, the middle row (alto clef, 𝄡) from {{key|A}} to {{key|J}}, and the bottom row (bass clef, 𝄢) from {{key|Z}} to {{key|M}}.

With a PlayStation controller, the notes from "do" to "ti" are mapped onto the left, up, right, down, {{key|ps-s}}, {{key|ps-t}}, and {{key|ps-c}} buttons, respectively. The alto clef notes (the middle row on PC and mobile) are displayed by default, and the {{key|ps-l1}} and {{key|ps-r1}} buttons need to be held to access the lower and higher keys, respectively.

==Disclaimer==
There is a disclaimer in-game regarding the use of the zither:
:When using the Performance function, please make sure that you use an original composition or have the relevant rights to use the melody you are playing in order to avoid harming the rights of any third parties and to avoid any actions in breach of or incompatible with our Terms of Service. Otherwise, we may have to restrict your use of this function.<br>Additionally, the content you perform can be heard and used by other players using this in-game function. Please read and confirm that you acknowledge the aforementioned stipulations.
