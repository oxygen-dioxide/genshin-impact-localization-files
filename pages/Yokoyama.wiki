::'''Yokoyama:''' This is a key site of the Kanjou Commission, not a place an outlander such as yourself should visit.
::'''Yokoyama:''' If you wish to seek an audience with the [[Hiiragi Shinsuke|Kanjou Commissioner]], then you should go to the [[Outlander Affairs Agency]] and hand in your letter and name card.
::'''Yokoyama:''' As for whether you can see the Commissioner... I'd say it's up to luck.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Yokoyama:''' Hmph... Whatever.
