==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Xilonen has caught a glimpse of the Blazegem Inscriptions' forging process and has guessed what Tlazolli means to use them for. For safety reasons, she will dismantle this particular Inscription and analyze its inner workings first, and then decide whether to help Tlazolli save the gravely ill Nechca.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Leave Tlazolli's house)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 1 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Let's head back to the tribe first. There are some things I need to get from my workshop.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 1 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Disassembling the Central Inscription... It's not gonna be easy.

;(Approach Xilonen's workshop)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You two can wait outside for a moment &mdash; I just need to go in and grab something. The workshop is a little messy, so unfortunately, I won't be able to show you around.
:{{DIcon}} But I want to have a look!
:{{DIcon}} A mess is what I like best!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Uh, that's not really what I mean... It's not the mess that's really the problem.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's just that the workshop is cluttered with way too much stuff... Books, files, and even ancient texts I got from Masters of the Night-Wind.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Everything's piled up to the ceiling. You probably won't know where to step once you're inside.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Kachina suffered quite an unfortunate series of events the last time she went inside... Ahem, I suppose it was my fault for being so focused on searching for information at the time that I forgot to lock the door...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' After entering the workshop, she was shocked to find herself face-to-face with a massive woven scroll from the Masters of the Night-Wind. Then, she turned around, and knocked over a huge stack of forging blueprints.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' She tried to step out of the way, but tripped on an poster tube that was behind her. And then, BOOM, the forging blueprints came crashing right onto the kid's head.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no...
:{{DIcon}} That must've hurt!
:{{DIcon}} W&ndash;Was Kachina okay?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' She's lucky I noticed in time. I found Kachina in a daze and managed to save her before an entire set of the History of the Children of Echoes was about to bury her... I then dragged her up to the second floor.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Ever since then, Kachina always waits outside the door, and doesn't dare take a step in whenever she comes to see me.
:{{DIcon}} Are there really that many books inside?
:{{DIcon}} I thought a workshop was supposed to be full of tools...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're an artisan and craftswoman, after all. We thought there would be weapons and armor hanging all over the place.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But it seems more like a library than a workshop.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, my primary work is forging Ancient Names, which is much trickier than making swords and tools. Aside from the necessary craftsmanship, I also need to consult many ancient texts.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You probably already know that each Ancient Name represents a certain "spirit," behind which are countless related stories to support it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In other words, the essence of an Ancient Name is the physical manifestation of a certain spiritual will.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And as a Name Engraver, when I'm working on a new Ancient Name, I'm not only trying to give it a physical shape...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But more importantly, I'm also trying to understand the spirit contained within the name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And to do that, I have to collect as many related stories as possible, and read through them all.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But, as you might know, people tend to add a lot of... extraneous details when it comes to stories about themselves.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' For stories that have been clearly exaggerated or altered, I must gather other related stories or information as cross-references...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' This way, I can filter out all the absurd and exaggerated details, and restore the person's life story to its true nature.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 19.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Only in true stories can you find the authentic spirit.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 20.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And this is the only way for the spirit to become an Ancient Name that matches its essence.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've heard about the concept behind Ancient Names before, but after hearing you explain the details, Paimon can't help but think that Ancient Names are really powerful!
:{{DIcon}} If only they could be even more powerful...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 21.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' No matter how powerful Ancient Names could be, they would never be able to suddenly turn into a blade, or allow you to smash through an entire cliff in one punch.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 22.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's just a form of spiritual power that's passed down from generation to generation. It doesn't have those kinds of physically tangible effects.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 23.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Um... Take your own names, for example.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 24.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' From the moment you appeared in this world, some person had already prepared a blessing for you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 25.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That person then condensed this "blessing" into your name, and gave it to you as a gift.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 26.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It may feel like the moment you received your name is already in the past, but it will always stay with you, and move with you into the future.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 27.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' "Names are blessings for the future from people standing in the past." That's what Aunt Tlazolli once told me.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 28.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' With this blessing, people will become more confident as they walk into their future... To put it another way, it's like having a lamp in your hand as you walk through the darkness of night.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets that! If you're alone when you're walking in the dark, it's easy to get scared and tired quickly.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if someone else is walking with you, then it won't be nearly as scary. And... well, you might still get tired, but it'll still be a whole lot better than walking alone.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 07b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}} always has Paimon by {{MC|m=his|f=her}} side though, so {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'ll never have to worry about that.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon's sure many wish they could be in your shoes, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} Please, you're always the one to get tired when we're on the road.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' P&mdash;Paimon's always flying! Of course it gets tiring... But we're getting off-topic! We can talk about that later...
:{{DIcon}} Try not to fall asleep on me next time...
:{{DIcon}} At least try not to eat so much...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 29.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Anyway, this is what Tlazolli told me when I was training as a Name Engraver.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 30.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' To be honest, I've only understood twenty percent of what she said at most. I've never been able to figure out the rest.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But doesn't that basically mean you don't get it!?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 31.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, that's not entirely true. Auntie and I have at least come to a consensus on the most important thing.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 32.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Ah, I'm sick of talking, we can talk about this more later.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Ah, you know what, I am sick of talking, we can talk about all of this later."</ref> Please wait a moment while I grab my things.
:{{Black Screen|Xilonen opens the door and walks into her workshop. Some unsettling crashing sounds come from the workshop, followed by some agonizing creaks and squeaks.}}
:{{Black Screen|Eventually, Xilonen rushes out the door with a box in her arms. She then turns around and kicks the door closed, shutting the sound of dusty books falling to the ground inside...}}
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you hear a whole section of something collapse in there just now?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 33.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' *coughs* It's fine, it's fine. It was just a bunch of very old Ancient Name records, I've already made copies of them.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 34.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I kept this set of Phlogiston Wedges in the back, so it wasn't easy to take out. I had to resort to brute force.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 2 xilonen 35.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Come on, let's go disassemble the Central Inscription. It shouldn't take long.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Here we are, this is the place.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This cliff is pretty high... What are we going to do here? Are we gonna climb to the very top and then throw this Inscription down the cliff?
:{{DIcon}} We're disassembling it, not destroying it, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure Xilonen knows what she's doing.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'm going to use phlogiston to make an engraving circle on the cliff wall. That will allow me to investigate the internals of the Central Inscription.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Now let me see if this thing can even turn on. I was still an apprentice the last time I used it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Before we attempt to engrave the inside pattern of an Ancient Name with phlogiston, we always use this to draw out the engraving diagram on a cliff or open ground.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Only after we've confirmed that phlogiston can flow properly through the internal engravings can we start formally working on the small internal engravings of the Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If we want to dismantle the Central Inscription in a non destructive manner, we'll have to use this thing... I really don't want to engrave such a large diagram with my bare hands.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you'll be able to see what it looks like on the inside without ruining Tlazolli's Inscription?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' For the most part. If it were just an ordinary unfinished Ancient Name piece, I'd just take it apart and pour phlogiston into the internal engravings to see everything.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But since it's the Central Inscription... It would be better not to destroy the blessing that Auntie has prepared for Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, Xilonen... Does this Central Inscription fall under the twenty percent you understand about Ancient Names, or the other eighty percent you don't understand?
:{{DIcon}} There's an eighty percent chance that it's part of the twenty percent.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Don't worry. As I said, Auntie and I share an understanding of the most important principle.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Which is... "Names are intrinsically valuable."
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Only by having names can things be sorted and categorized. They allow the world to become more orderly and identifiable.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' For example, when I order ore, I would usually say, "I need Volcanic Crystals of about thirty-five percent purity and no more than three percent of impurities."
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Without specific names, I would only be able to go to the ore merchant and say, "I want this, and this... No, this isn't it. That one? No, that one isn't it, either."
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Names are a crucial part of how we standardize our workflow. Without names, the work would be impossible.
:{{DIcon}} Hm, makes sense...
:{{DIcon}} So you're talking about it from a technical perspective...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Yes, because forging Ancient Names is first and foremost a technical job. There's no debating that.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' As for the question of why it's important... As long as it does not affect your ability to perform the work, you'll gradually understand it as you put the process into practice.
:{{DIcon}} You really care about efficiency above all else...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like the most efficient approach...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' After all, creating an Ancient Name is quite the complicated process...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' *sigh* Let me break it down even further, we're not in the tribe right now anyway... Essentially, by forging Ancient Names, I'm assigning "nicknames" to the heroes in Natlan's history.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 19.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Giving someone a name is a subjective expression. You just need to express your hopes and wishes for them.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 20.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But giving someone a nickname is a much more objective expression. To come up with a fitting and accurate nickname requires much thought and observation.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 21.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If Ancient Names... I mean, if nicknames aren't descriptive enough, no one will remember them anyway.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 22.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So the best I can do is gather all the information I could, and try to come up with the most fitting nicknames possible.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 23.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Even a minor mistake in the process could cause people to misunderstand the nickname. For a Name Engraver such as myself, such mistakes would be considered a major blunder.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon! Nicknames are your specialty!
:{{DIcon}} See? Your nicknames need more thought and observation, Paimon!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon isn't trying to come up with a nickname for Xilonen! Besides, all of Paimon's nicknames have been very descriptive. Everyone can remember them!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 24.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Now I'm curious. Why don't you come up with one for me?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Are you serious!?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 25.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Of course. This is also my line of work, you know. Go ahead.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... A nickname... Xilonen... She uses phlogiston to forge weapons and make names for others...
:{{DIcon}} Don't over stress, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} You'd better make it a good one.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, uhhh... Smith?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 26.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hahaha. Not bad, not bad, and quite fitting, too. I'll remember it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 27.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But you should keep observing my work, Paimon. Maybe you'll come up with an even better nickname.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 3 xilonen 28.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Right, time to make like a "Smith" and start smithing. Watch closely.

:{{A|vo xnnlq004 4 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' ...I'll leave some space here. When the linked engravings are activated, the inscriptions here will overlap with each other.

;(Finish connecting the Phlogiston Wedges)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 4 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' There... that should complete the flow.

;(After connecting the Phlogiston Wedges)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Amazing, Xilonen! You were running all over that cliff as if it was flat ground!
:{{DIcon}} Is that the power of the Children of Echoes?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It doesn't have anything to do with my tribe.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Oh no, it doesn't have anything to do with my tribe."</ref> It's just the phlogiston adhesive I have on my shoes.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But after all that running around, I'll have to infuse them with more phlogiston again... I should prepare a spare supply of Phlogiston to bring with me next time.
:{{DIcon}} Don't tell me you're actually already covered head to toe in work equipment?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' More or less, yeah. I usually have at least the key equipment on hand.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I can show them to you when we next find the time. But let's get to work first.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Let me see... Start with anchor one, and activate it with density three phlogiston...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, a super huge diagram just appeared!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tlazolli's Central Inscription is even floating...!
:{{Black Screen|After some time, the blasts of Phlogiston cease and the Central Inscription returns to Xilonen's hands.}}
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So are you done checking the Inscription, Xilonen? How does it look?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I didn't find any anomalies in the Phlogiston Engraving. All the adjustments are indeed based on Ancient Name engraving techniques.
:{{DIcon}} So you're saying that everything's normal?
:{{DIcon}} So that means...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That means we can help Tlazolli and Nechca now, right?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Probably, but I have good news and bad news. Oh, but I'm also just going to go ahead and share both, so it's not like you'll have a choice in the matter.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon will cover her ears after the good news...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Even if you cover your ears, the issue will still continue to exist... But before we get to that, I want to ask {{Traveler}} a question.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Well... even if you cover your ears, the issue will still continue to exist... But um, y-you know, before we get to that, I wanna ask the {{Traveler}} a question."</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' What are your thoughts on absorbing memories?
:{{DIcon}} It's necessary to save Nechca.
::{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 11a 1.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sounds like something you would say.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Um... Yeah, well... Sounds like something you'd say."</ref>
::{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 11a 2.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But if you ask me, there's a problem with what Auntie said.
:{{DIcon}} It somehow doesn't seem right.
::{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 11b 1.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I knew you felt the same way. That'll save me some initial explanation, I've never been very good at that anyway.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's hard to control the absorption of memories. Technically speaking, this type of Inscription has the power to do far more than absorb memories related to a single person.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' By herself, Auntie can't handle that level and scope of work, but if she has accomplices... It is completely possible for her to use this Inscription to accomplish far bigger things.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Accomplices... You make it sound like she's committing a crime...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, here's the good news. Yes, this Blazegem Inscription would be the perfect tool to commit crimes, but we haven't found any accomplices or signs that she intends to put it to such uses.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' From a purely objective standpoint, we can consider that possibility as "yet to be confirmed" for now.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The bad news is... there is still an underlying problem with this Blazegem Inscription that cannot be ignored.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I believe I've mentioned it to you before. Ancient Names operate with the help of the Wayob, granting them the power to read information kept in the Ley Lines.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In this process, the Wayob actually function like relays, helping the Ancient Name bearer sense the information from within the Ley Lines.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 19.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If you remove the Wayob from the process and don't use any tools, then finding a specific story is akin to...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 20.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Trying to scoop up a specific grain of sand from a rushing river.
:{{DIcon}} So before you're even able to retrieve the sand...
:{{DIcon}} You would most likely drown.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 21.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Exactly. Anyone who attempts to do so will likely lose most of their cognitive function, or become a babbling madman who talks to themselves all day long.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 22.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Now, let's consider the memories that Auntie has gathered as the Ley Line, and Nechca as the only Ancient Name bearer of this Ley Line.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 23.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' There's no way Auntie would let Nechca plunge into the river of memories without any tools &mdash; she'd only be overwhelmed by the surge of memories.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 24.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And considering that Nechca has forgotten all of her past, she'll be unable to work on her own to accurately find the "correct past."
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 25.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Only Aunt Tlazolli can help her filter the correct memories of her past.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 26.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So, if my hypothesis is correct, Auntie is actually planning on turning herself into Nechca's "Wayob" to help her extract the corresponding memories in the different situations she may face.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 27.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In an ideal world, this would be perfectly fine. As long as every extracted memory is correct, Nechca would essentially be getting her past back.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 28.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And I also believe that there won't be any mistakes in everything that Auntie remembers about Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 29.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But... Aunt Tlazolli is not a Wayob. Her body won't be able to handle the load for long.
:{{DIcon}} So at any moment, she might just...
:{{DIcon}} I see... This is the problem that we can't ignore.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But how can we solve this problem!? No matter how we try, Tlazolli will...
:{{DIcon}} She's already made up her mind.
:{{DIcon}} She's ready to pay the price.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 30.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' "Names are blessings for the future from people standing in the past"...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 5 xilonen 31.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I've also made up my mind. C'mon, let's go see Auntie.
----
;(Talk to Tlazolli)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Ah, Xilonen. It looks like... you've made your decision. Am I right?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Yes. Here's some research that I've done. You can reference it to modify the way the Central Inscription operates.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'll also help you continue working on the Blazegem Inscription, but I must have complete control over all the Inscriptions, and the ability to oversee their uses.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The memories that can be absorbed by the Inscription will be limited solely to Nechca's past. We'll plan a set timeframe together from which the memories can be drawn from shortly.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If you attempt to extract any memories beyond this scope, then I'll consider that as committing a criminal act, and halt all work related to the Central Inscription.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' After the memory bank is constructed, the Blazegem Inscriptions' absorption functions must be stopped immediately. Only functionalities for outputting memories will be kept.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 02.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I accept.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Thank you, Xilonen. I really...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Auntie, you know I can't stand it when you do this. If you needed my help, you should have just said so. There's no need to beat around the bush like you did.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Using technology for Ancient Names to forge other things without permission is no trivial matter. I...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Yes, it's a major departure from the technology's intended use. But it's nothing compared to a child who needs help... compared to a name that's about to be lost.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But once this is all over, you must come with me to see [[Pacal]] and discuss everything that happened.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' That's fine. I'm willing to accept any punishment for my little Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Alright, let's clear off the table and come up with a plan...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I need some time to consider how to let Nechca control the Blazegem Inscription on her own and extract the memories from her past.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' By the way, did you give the book to Nechca?<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "*sigh* Oh um... By the way, did you... Give the book to Nechca?"</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' How could I just hand her a birthday present that you specially brought for her?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I've picked out a box and packaged it up. Wait till her birthday and then bring it to her, it'll be a nice surprise.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's just an old book, there's no need to&mdash;
:{{Color|menu|An unusual and heavy sound comes from the direction of the room again...}}
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, is Nechca up again? But what was all that noise? It sounded like something broke.
:{{DIcon}} Oh no, did she fall?
::{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, that's not good! Let's go have a look!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe she knocked something over?
::{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 02b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh! What if something fell on her? We should check. Paimon will go have a look!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 08.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Nechca, don't hurt yourself!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Xilonen, is that you?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, you're Nechca?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 09.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' How many times have I told you? Don't get out of bed on your own. You were running a fever yesterday.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hello, Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 03.ogg}} '''[[Nepecha|Nechca]]:''' Thank you for the book, I've already read it several times.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've already read it? But didn't Tlazolli package up the book that Xilonen brought?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 10.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' No, she's all mixed up. The one she read isn't from Xilonen, it's one I bought for her before.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 11.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' A few days ago, she told {{sic|me wanted}} a book. I know nothing about those kinds of books, so I had no choice but to go to the tribe and look for a copy.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 12.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I eventually found one and bought it for her. I put it in her room once I got back.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 13.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Soon after, she suddenly developed a fever. I was so busy taking care of her that I forgot about the book and even forgot that she had asked you for a gift.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Auntie, do you know which version of the book you bought?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 14.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Which version? The shopkeeper said it was [[Spanking New Copy of "Tequil the Brave"|the one with the "perfect" ending to the story]]. Apparently, that's the only one you can find on the market now.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 15.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Ugh, it's all my fault. You wasted your money, and now, it won't even be a surprise...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's alright, it's just a book. As long as Nechca enjoys it, that's what matters.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh right, Nechca probably doesn't know us. We're&mdash;
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 04b.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' You're Paimon and {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}! Mom told me about you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, hehe, seems like everyone knows who we are now.
:{{DIcon}} No need to introduce ourselves anymore.
:{{DIcon}} Hello, Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Nechca seems to be doing pretty well today. Since she's been stuck indoors for the last few days, why don't we take her out for a walk?
:{{DIcon}} Let's check your temperature...
:{{DIcon}} Seems the fever's gone.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 16.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Take her for a walk... But, considering her condition, I don't think she&ndash;
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Don't worry, Auntie. She'll be safe with {{Traveler}} and me.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We won't leave the tribe, and if anything comes up, we'll be sure to find the doctor immediately.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 19.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Besides, it's her birthday in a few days, and we need to go to the tribe to buy some things. Let's give her a proper celebration.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 20.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' What do you think, Auntie?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 05.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' I promise I'll be good, Mom.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 06.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Didn't you say before that I need more fresh air?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 17.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Alright, alright. As you wish.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 18.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I also happen to have a few repaired Blazegem Inscriptions that I need to get back to the tribe. We can go together.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 19.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Wait for a moment. I'll go get Nechca's water bottle and some towels... Ah, some medicine... Oh, and a parasol.
:{{Black Screen|Tlazolli enters Nechca's room. After quickly packing, she comes back out...}}
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Talk about being prepared...
:{{DIcon}} We can camp out with all that stuff.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 tlazolli 20.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' It doesn't hurt to be prepared. Okay, let's go. Please be good, now, Nechca. Don't cause any trouble for Xilonen and the others.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 xilonen 21.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You can let me carry these. Don't be a stranger, Nechca, feel free to tell us anything. Even I was quite a handful for Auntie when I was little.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, yeah! It's not often you get to go out to play, so just have fun! Everything will be fine.
:{{DIcon}} If you don't stir up some trouble when you're little...
:{{DIcon}} Then you'll never get the chance again.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 07.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Okay. Thanks, everyone. And please don't worry, Mom.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 6 nechca 08.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' I'll be good.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 7 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Let's go look for Iknal. I've had her Blazegem Inscription for a while now, and I'll finally return it to her today.

;(Approach Iknal)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 01.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' Tlazolli, what brings you to the tribe today? Oh? And Nechca, too!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 02.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' She seems to be doing much better now! She's even out and about. I'm sure it won't be long before she'll be playing with [[Chanil]] and the others.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I hope so. Here, Iknal, this is your Inscription. I've finished repairing it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 03.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' Oh, thank you for bringing it back for me. By the way, I came across a piece of good-quality ore a while ago. I was thinking of using it to make some pretty jewelry for little Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 04.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' I remember that Nechca would become so happy every time she saw a shiny ring. Right, Nechca?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 02.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I'm sure she'd love that, thank you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 05.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' My pleasure. Give me a moment, I'll bring the ore.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I can make the jewelry for her. What kind would you like, Nechca?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 01.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' I would like...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Something shaped like an Embercore Flower would be nice. She was always asking me before to make her an Ancient Name with an Embercore Flower design.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Noted. I'll make that as a gift for her next birthday.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sorry, Nechca. It won't be a surprise for you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 02.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' ...That's okay. Thank you, Xilonen.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 06.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' Found it! Sorry to keep you waiting. Here, please take it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 07.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' By the way, Nechca, feel free to write to me if you ever want to know more about ores.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 08.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' I was shocked last time when you wrote me out of the blue asking for a Volcanic Crystal.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' *sigh* Sorry about that. She can hardly contain her curiosity now that she's started to recover.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' She's still too weak to go out whenever she wants, so she begs me every day to help her write letters to people in the tribe about all sorts of things.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 iknal 09.ogg}} '''Iknal:''' Hahaha! That's how you know she's one of the Children of Echoes. It's normal for us to be interested in ore.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Everything's looking up. Hehe, we're just like the main character in the [[Spanking New Copy of "Tequil the Brave"|new version of Tequil the Brave]] when he was about to save his brother, Rimac.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' According to the story, we should be right around... Hmm, let Paimon see...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Tequil prayed to the Goddess of Mountains and Fire, 'Let my brother's name ever live on. I am willing to sacrifice my heart and blood in return.'"
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "The Goddess replied, 'I've heard your prayer, but your brother is no longer your kin. His name has sunken into the deepest of depths.'"
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 03.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Then, Tequil said...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 04.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' "Turn my blood to fire, so my heart may illuminate the depths. I will bring my brother back before my blood runs dry."
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! You remembered that whole line, Nechca! Paimon remembers that's exactly what the book... Huh? Wait, what did the book say?
:{{DIcon}} You forgot? But didn't you just read it, Paimon?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon finished both books in one sitting! A lot of their content is nearly the same, so it's easy to get mixed up.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the ending in the [[Somewhat Aged Copy of "Tequil the Brave"|older version]] is more interesting. Even if it's hard for kids to, well... completely understand.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, wait! Nechca hasn't read the other ending... It's okay! Just wait a bit, and Paimon will read it out for you!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 05.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Th&ndash;That's not true. Actually... I already know the other ending.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You already know the other ending? But didn't you only read the edition your Mom got for you...?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Hey, what are you all chatting about so happily?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 06.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' ...!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 07b.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Mom... {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}} and I were just talking about the ending of that book.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 08.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' We were just talking about how the bad guy was defeated and everyone returned home safely... It's a really happy ending.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} (That's... not the "other ending" she was talking about.)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Aren't happy endings always nice? But if you already read the whole thing, then what will Mom have to read to you at bedtime?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 08.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Guess you'll have to go to bed early tonight. But I'll buy you some more fairy tales next time, okay?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 09.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Okay, Mom...
:{{DIcon}} So, how's the ore?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's pretty good quality. I'll be able to give Nechca a beautiful and durable piece of jewelry for her next birthday.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' But for now, let's focus on celebrating her upcoming birthday.

:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 09.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Next, let's visit Apoxpalon, he should be close by.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 tlazolli 10.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Stay close, Nechca. Don't go too far.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 8 nechca 10.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Yes, Mom...

;(Approach Apoxpalon)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 01.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' Why do my eyebrows keep twitching today? Strange...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' That means you're about the hit the jackpot, Apoxpalon.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 02.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' Haha, I didn't expect to have two Name Engravers coming in today. Welcome!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 03.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' What are you looking to buy, Tlazolli? I'll give you a discount like usual!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, offering a discount just like that? Tlazolli sure has connections...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 04.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' She was once our Name Engraver, and did a lot for the tribe. It's only fair that I offer her a discount.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 tlazolli 02.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Thank you for your generosity... I've finished repairing your Blazegem Inscription. Here, have a look.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Come on Nechca, say thank you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 01.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Thank you, sir...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 05.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' Oh, so this is Nechca? Tlazolli has shown me some pictures before.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 06.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' It looks like you are doing much better now. How about this? Go ahead and pick anything you'd like from the store. Think of it as a gift from me.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 02.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' No, no, that's alright. Mom told me that you've already given a lot to our family.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 07.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' Well, that was for your family. I've never given anything just for you. If you don't feel like it, you can also let your Mom choose for you.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' No need to stand on ceremony, Auntie. Go ahead and pick something for Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' His drills and small clamps are good quality. The measurements of each part are exact, and they are always very durable.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I always come here to buy things if I find myself in a pinch.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Do you have any child-friendly safety scissors? I remember seeing a few different styles.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 apoxpalon 08.ogg}} '''Apoxpalon:''' I have a few in stock, but I put them in the back. Let me bring some out for you to pick.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' No need to bring them all the way here. Why don't we just go in the back and choose there? It should only take a moment.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I don't know much about that kind of scissors, why don't you just go yourself and...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' There are too many different designs and varieties of kid's scissors. If you don't come and help me choose, I won't be able to pick one that Nechca would like.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Come on, Auntie. It'll only take a moment.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There goes Xilonen dragging Tlazolli off to buy more stuff. What a busy day...
:{{DIcon}} Let's just wait for them here.
:{{DIcon}} Be sure to stay close, Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 03.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' I won't run off. Um, Paimon... who's your favorite character in Tequil the Brave?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's favorite? Tequil of course! He went through a lot to rescue his family.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In the [[Somewhat Aged Copy of "Tequil the Brave"|old version of the story]], he was never able to reunite with his family... But he was still really strong and fought as best as he could.
:{{DIcon}} He's a brave character.
:{{DIcon}} I admire his courage.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about you, Nechca? Which character do you like?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 04.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' I... I like Rimac.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... the one who was possessed by Coatlicue but never forgot his brother Tequil. He was also an amazing character!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If it wasn't for his determination, both he and his brother would have been defeated by Coatlicue in the final battle.
:{{DIcon}} Wow, you remember all the details, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like you were really immersed in the story.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! A story's only interesting if you can really get immersed in it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Nechca, why don't we play pretend? You can be Rimac, and Paimon will be Tequil, okay?
:{{DIcon}} You just like reciting epic lines.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 05b.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}... Can I play the role of Coatlicue?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But isn't she the villain? In the old version, she even ate Rimac and took on his appearance.
:{{DIcon}} You said it yourself. That's the old version.
:{{DIcon}} That wasn't the one Nechca read.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, right. She read the version with a happy ending... In that one, Coatlicue was defeated and the brothers both survived.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, it doesn't matter, only the lines at the end were different. You can go ahead and say your favorite lines, Nechca. Paimon's read both versions, so she'll be able to play along.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 06.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' My favorite line is the one from the end! It's...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Come here, Nechca. Look at you... You're sweating.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 nechca 07.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Mom!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Let me wipe your forehead. Now, drink some water. This child... You forget everything as soon as you start playing.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We've picked something out for Nechca. Apoxpalon will deliver it to Auntie's house once he's packaged it up. How was Nechca?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were just about to get to the exciting part...
:{{DIcon}} Xilonen, did you leave us with Nechca on purpose?
:{{DIcon}} So we could talk with her alone?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, really? Oh, now that Paimon thinks about it, Xilonen has dragged Tlazolli away from us a couple of times now. But why?
:{{DIcon}} Nechca has a strange look on her face...
:{{DIcon}} Seems like she has something to say.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Let's talk later. Just trust me, and act normal for now.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We should head to our last stop, Auntie. It's real hot today, and we shouldn't let Nechca be in the heat for too long.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 9 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Right, let's go see Cheven and head back home.

;(Approach Cheven)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I've finished repairing your Blazegem Inscription, Cheven. I've also reinforced it, so it shouldn't fall apart so easily now.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 01.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' Thank you... How about the Volcanic Crystal? Was it usable?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 02.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Yes, thanks for that.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 02.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' You're welcome. I just want to see Nechca get better.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 01.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Thank you, Miss Cheven...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 03.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' *sigh* It's fine. Honestly, you're both too polite for your own good...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I was wondering where you got the ore for such a large-scale Blazegem Inscription.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So you must be one of Tlazolli's accomplices, then?<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "So you must be one of auntie's accomplices, then?"</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 04.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' Oh, Xilonen... um...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We already know what's going on.
:{{DIcon}} We're all doing our best for Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 05.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' Whew, you had me worried there! I thought we'd been found out... We'd be in real trouble if Pacal ever got wind of it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 06.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' To be honest, I won't be able to cover it up for much longer. I've been traveling away from home every few days, and the ore reserves have noticeably decreased...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 07.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' The last time Pacal came and asked me about it, I could only say that I'd been using up a lot of ore to research new styles of jewelry...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 08.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' As for why I had been leaving so often, I said that I had found a new ore vein and wanted to extract some new gems from it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 09.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' Ah, sorry... I've been talking my head off. Please come in and have a seat.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Sure, we can sit for a moment, but...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 02.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Miss Cheven, can I... go see some of the jewelry over there?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 10.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' You mean Imix's work? Sure, go ahead. Remember to stay in the shade as much as you can.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants to go, too! We'll go together. Paimon hasn't looked at Natlan's jewelry very closely yet.
:{{DIcon}} I'll have to buy you some.
:{{DIcon}} If the price is good, we could buy you a whole set.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Then Paimon's gonna take a good look at what they have.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You haven't bought any jewelry for a while, Auntie. Why don't you pick one out?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} (Xilonen's taking Tlazolli with her again...)
:{{DIcon}} (Let's keep talking with Nechca...)
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, Nechca. We don't know anything about Natlan's jewelry, so you can help us pick something out!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 03b.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}, I...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Come here, Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 04.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' ...!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Sorry, Cheven and Xilonen, but it's already getting late. We should be heading back now.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' It'll be Nechca's birthday in a few days, and there's still a lot for us to do before then...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 cheven 11.ogg}} '''Cheven:''' No problem, I'll be sure to bring her some beautiful jewelry to celebrate.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 05.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Mom, I...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 08.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' You're getting hot again... Here, Mom will carry you. Let's get going.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 09.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' You forget to take care of yourself once you start playing. Let's go back and we'll have a talk.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 06.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' I... I didn't...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 10.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Nechca, I never taught you to lie.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 nechca 07.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' S&mdash;Sorry, Mom. I... I...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nechca's looking at us... Paimon feels like something's not right. What should we do?
:{{DIcon}} ...Just wait.
:{{DIcon}} Stay quiet. Let's see what Xilonen says.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Nechca was having so much fun today that she forgot the time. It's not a big deal.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Let me help carry her home. I'm worried you would also have to recover if you carried her the whole way.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 11.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' No, it's fine. I'll carry her.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 10 tlazolli 12.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Let's go, Nechca. It's time to go home.
:{{Black Screen|Tlazolli declines your help and leaves the tribe, carrying Nechca. She is staggering somewhat by the time she reaches home, but she is still able to shield Nechca behind her...}}

:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 01.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Thank you, everyone, for spending so much time with us today.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 02.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Please be sure to come to Nechca's birthday party.
:{{DIcon}} We'll be there.
:{{DIcon}} I hope she'll continue to feel better.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 03.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Alright, it's nearly bedtime for Nechca, so let's part our ways here.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Auntie, remember to give her the book that copy of Tequil the Brave I brought. I went to a lot of trouble to find it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 04.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I understand. Really, do you think I'd let your efforts go to waste?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 05.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' It's very special to receive a book from you, I'm sure she'll put it somewhere safe... Right, Nechca?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 nechca 01.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Y&ndash;Yeah. Thanks, Xilonen...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Put it somewhere? Isn't she going to read it?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 06.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Well, I've read the story to her many times already, she's even memorized nearly every line...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That won't be a problem, Auntie. Nechca has probably never heard this version of Tequil the Brave.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 07.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Oh? What's different about this version?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The majority is about the same, but the ending is different from the one that you bought her.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The one I gave her is the unedited version that was originally published.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It was released long before Nechca fell ill.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 08.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Oh? But I remember you were never very interested in fairy tales, Xilonen.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, I was just thinking that if what you said about Nechca's illness is true, she shouldn't be able to remember anything about her past before her illness...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So, the ending to the original version of Tequil the Brave is also part of the past that she should have forgotten.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In other words, if she hasn't recently read the old version of the story, then she couldn't possibly know the ending, right?<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "[...] she shouldn't possibly know [...]"</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 09.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' I don't understand. Why are you so concerned about the ending of this book? Even if she does remember the ending, what does that prove?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 10.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Maybe she snuck out somewhere when I wasn't watching, and read the first edition of the story.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That is a possibility. After all, she does remember things that have happened recently.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' In which case, let's go ask around the tribe and see if anyone remembers Nechca reading that book.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' There are only a few shops in the tribe that sell books. Or, we can just ask Nechca where she had read it.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 11.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' The book sellers all have Inscriptions, so there's a chance that their memories...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So, you admit that the Blazegem Inscriptions can also affect the tribe's current memories?<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "So, you admit that the Inscriptions can affect the tribe's current memories?"</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I was very clear that I would consider that a crime, and would put a stop to all work on the Blazegem Inscription.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "[...] and would stop all work on it."</ref>
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 12.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' ...There must be a few more books at home, I...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' "I do not wish to see your blood be reduced to ash, but I have seen the light of your heart and spirit..."
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 13.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' ...I beg your pardon?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 16.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Nechca, where did you read that book? Answer me.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 14.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Go home, Nechca.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 nechca 02.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' I... I...
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 15.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Are you disobeying me?
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 17.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You're the one who wrote me the letter, Nechca. You're the one who wanted the book. Only you can speak for yourself.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 xilonen 18.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We're listening, Nechca. Right here, right now.
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 nechca 03.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' "...Remember my name, brother. As long as you remember me, I will never have left."
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 tlazolli 16.ogg}} '''Tlazolli:''' Silence!
:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the line from the old ending! Nechca remembers it!

:{{A|vo xnnlq004 12 nechca 05.ogg}} '''Nechca:''' Ahhh!!!
