==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rhemia:''' The morning crowd's larger than the afternoon one...
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Rhemia/Duel: Rhemia|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Rhemia:''' Six! You're my sixth victory for today!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Rhemia:''' Eight! You're the eighth to have defeated me!
:{{DIcon}} What sort of crowd?
::'''Rhemia:''' The sort that wear hats.
::'''Rhemia:''' Different humans exhibit different behaviors. Some wear hats, and others don't. Same for drinking coffee, or being in a hurry...
::'''Rhemia:''' I love categorizing them and summarizing the various patterns they follow.
::'''Rhemia:''' For example, more people wear hats in the morning than in the afternoon. Do you know why that is?
::'''Rhemia:''' From my observations, it seems that people are properly dressed when they head out in the morning.
::'''Rhemia:''' But in the afternoon, after a day at work, they stop sweating the small details. They loosen their ties, take off their hats, and run out to the platforms happily.
::{{DIcon}} You're very meticulous.
::'''Rhemia:''' Thank you. It seems to be a quality I possess...
::'''Rhemia:''' Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Rhemia from the [[Marechaussee Phantom]].
::'''Rhemia:''' I'm on vacation right now, but I can go back into work mode at any time, if some emergency calls for it.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Rhemia:''' See you.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Given that the names of Melusines are derived from fairy figures, "Rhemia" may be based on {{W|Lamia}}, a half-woman, half-snake being in Greek mythology, similar to the {{W|Melusine}} in European folklore.
