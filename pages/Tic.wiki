==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Tic is a dockworker willing to be hired for work for the [[Rite of Parting]].

While willing to negotiate his hiring rate, he will get angry if the [[Traveler]] continuously lowballs an offer. He will also initially refuse to go pick up his payment from [[Childe]] himself, citing that it's not worth it without a detour fee. After receiving the fee, he will guarantee the work to be done before he goes home.

===Personality===
Tic is a man who is confident in his ability to get the job done. He tells the Traveler that he always puts in one hundred percent effort into everything he does, and says so before hearing the Traveler's job description. However, he mentions that there will be a premium if they want him to give a hundred and ten percent.
His detour fee is a [[Qingxin]] flower that he wanted to give to his daughter in order to pacify her.
