{{Lang|'''Efim Snezhevich'''|ru=Ефим Снежевич|ru_rm=Yefim Snezhevich}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the World Quest [[The Replacement's Secret]]. He is referred to by the [[Fatui]] operatives in [[Inazuma]] as the "Teacher".

==Profile==
Efim is a Snezhevich,<ref group="Note">Snezhevich is not a surname. It is a {{w|Eastern Slavic naming customs#Patronymics|patronymic}}, meaning "Son of Snow" in Russian. This is a masculine term.</ref> an orphan raised by the [[Fatui]]. He grew up in [[Arlecchino]]'s orphanage, and is [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]]'s superior.

After a ceasefire was announced between the [[Inazuma Shogunate]] and [[Watatsumi Army]], Efim and his subordinates arrived in [[Inazuma]] to restart the war by "poisoning" [[Watatsumi Island]] by posing as Shogunate personnel. He hoped that this would improve Arlecchino's prestige following [[Signora]]'s death.

He sent Lyudochka to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] and three others across [[Ritou]] and [[Inazuma City]]. Lyudochka began to enjoy life in Inazuma and started stalling her assignments, which he was made aware of after [[Tae]] informed him of her discovery of a light novel in Lyudochka's purse. Efim snapped at this as he was well aware of her intentional stalling and gave her his [["Final Instructions"]] before leaving, unaware that they were being listened in on by the Traveler. The Traveler defeated Lyudochka, who expressed remorse and opposed the plan. As her life was in danger by Efim as long as she was alive, the Traveler asked Momoyo to make a fake body double and put Lyudochka's clothes on them. Momoyo let herself get captured by the Fatui and Lyudochka's "corpse" was discovered, which Efim verified as hers from the clothing. Annoyed that his critical piece was gone, he tasked his subordinates to interrogate Momoyo and continue the operation as planned before being recalled to [[Snezhnaya]], unaware that the Shuumatsuban were fully aware of his plans.

===Personality===
Efim is a loyal member of the Fatui, especially towards Arlecchino. The plan he concocted to restart the war between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Island of his own design, which he thought of as a gift of gratitude to him for taking him in, even seeing the resulting orphans of Watatsumi Island as a gain despite Lyudochka's reservations. He is brash and quick to anger, as his subordinates note of his temper and that he would likely blame them if his plan failed, as he did not report the plan to the Harbinger. While he shows some restraint towards Lyudochka due to their past, he also makes it clear that he does not tolerate her stalling her orders.
