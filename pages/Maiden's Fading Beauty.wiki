{{Description|A meticulously well-maintained woman's hat that keeps wrinkles safely out of sight.}}
'''Maiden's Fading Beauty''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Maiden Beloved]].

==Description==
Even when surrounded by flowers from her courters,<br />The maiden never removed her hat to get a better look at them.<br />Their names and faces were not worth remembering.

For years, at the end of every day,<br />the maiden would brush off the dust on her hat.<br />But the passage of time showed in her face, too — and unlike the dust, it could never be brushed off.

As time passed, fewer and fewer courters visited her with flowers.<br />What did it matter? For her, time had already stopped long ago on that fateful day.
