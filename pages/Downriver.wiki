==History==
Downriver was named due to its location in relation to another fishing town called "Upriver," as its villagers had moved in from that place. With them, they brought their generational knowledge of fishing. Beidou arrived in the village when she was about five or six years old, and was taken in by the village chief. At the time, the village was a lively place and was home to several families. A couple years after Beidou's arrival, however, the village chief passed away from illness, the season's harvest was poor, and the fishermen's catch was gradually diminishing. The coincidence of these unfortunate events led the villagers to blame each other for their hardship. They eventually pinned the blame on Beidou and drove her out of the village.<ref name="life">{{Ref/Quest|Life on the High Seas}}</ref>

As fishing gradually became more difficult and some other "small incidents" occurred, people began to leave, until Downriver was completely abandoned. The village remains uninhabited to this day and has fallen into a state of disrepair, with Beidou remarking that it has "certainly seen better days."<ref name="life"/>

==Trivia==
* This town may also be where [[Xiling]] lived, as she grew up together with Beidou.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Xiling}}</ref>
* The river that Downriver and Upriver's names refer to is likely [[Bishui River]].
