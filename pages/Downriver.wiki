{{Quote|People used to call this place "Downriver," because the villagers apparently moved here from a place called "Upriver." With them, they brought their knowledge of fishing which had been passed down from generation to generation. I learned a lot from them when I was here.|[[Beidou]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life on the High Seas}}</ref>}}
'''Downriver''' is an abandoned fishing village located to the west of [[Wangshu Inn]] at [[Bishui Plain]], just along [[Cuijue Slope]].

Its name was first stated in [[Beidou]]'s [[Hangout Event]], Act I: [[When the Crux Shines Bright]] as the village that Beidou grew up in.

==Trivia==
*This town may also be where [[Xiling]] lived, as she mentions she taught Beidou fishing songs and that they are childhood friends.
*There is another, sister town to Downriver called [[Upriver]]. The location of Upriver is unknown.
**Its name could imply that it is located further up the [[Bishui River]].
