The '''Temple of Silence''' is an organization and location within [[Sumeru]], responsible for keeping and guarding the knowledge from the era of [[King Deshret]].

==Overview==
Not much is currently known regarding the Temple of Silence. It is depicted to be a part of the [[Akademiya]] in the second volume of ''[[A Thousand Nights]]'', wherein envoys from the Temple of Silence approached a [[Vahumana]] Dastur to inform him of his mentor's death and his promotion to Herbad. Notably, [[Cyno]] is affiliated with the Temple of Silence according to his in-game profile, and an unnamed member of the Temple of Silence has commented on [[Alhaitham]]'s default outfit, [[The Rational]]. At the Akademiya, the Temple of Silence primarily handles the custody and disposal of information not meant to be disseminated to the public, though this is just a front for their true duties.

They have also been shown to have some degree of authority over certain matters, as a report from the Akademiya Investigation Team found in the [[Valley of Dahri]] states an order from the Temple of Silence that all machines from [[Khaenri'ah]] be sealed. In addition, one of the rumors regarding [[Faruzan]]'s disappearance is that she came into contact with [[King Deshret]]'s ancient knowledge and, as a result, was secretly imprisoned within the Temple of Silence,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Faruzan|1}}</ref> indicating that it is a location known for holding detained persons.

In actuality, the Temple of Silence was founded by [[Hermanubis]] and his followers following the death of [[King Deshret]] and were led to [[Tulaytullah]], where they became stewards of knowledge that survived from King Deshret's civilization. However, this peace was threatened despite efforts from the [[Tighnarians]], as the Eremites sought Deshret's knowledge. The king of [[Gurabad]] laid siege to the city and demanded the Temple of Silence as proof of his victory, which was given to him by the ruling elite, who betrayed the Temple by declaring that their stores of knowledge was the true source of corruption. To stop the forbidden knowledge from being released, Hermanubis shattered himself into many fragments and bestowed them to his followers, who repelled the tyrant's army. However, they were shunned and subsequently left for the rainforest, while Tulaytullah fell into ruin. Despite this, they were viewed with suspicion by the people in the rainforest and did not trust the Akademiya due to the sages' corruption, thus returning to the desert and setting up a large underground temple near [[Thamud Oasis]] about 400 years ago.

During the time the Temple of Silence was with the Akademiya, the organization proposed the rules regarding the six cardinal sins, which was still practiced to this day, although the sages had taken credits for creating them.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Djer}}</ref>

The Akademiya wanted to cover The Temple of Silence's defect since it may expose their corruption. Therefore, they created an empty organization with the same name to hide the fact that the real Temple of Silence had left the rainforest. The false organization is responsible for the custody and disposal of information and documents not fit for public dissemination, just like a true Temple of Silence, but as noted by Alhaitham, it is only a front and it's functionally obsolette. This false organization may be a basis for the Temple of Silence in ''A Thousand Nights'', and the member that has commented on Alhaitham's default outfit is likely from it.

Due to the lack of Hermanubis' presence, the real Temple of Silence began to decline. Having possession of two Ba Fragments - shards of Hermanubis' raw power, the head of the Temple, [[Bamoun]], decided to implant them into suitable vessels to bring the organization back to its glory days. However, he soon discovered that the fragments rejected adult bodies, and as such, offered his adoptive grandson [[Sethos]] as one, and discovered another suitable child &mdash; [[Cyno]]. He convinced his biological parents to release him into his custody with a large payment. The two successfully resonated with the fragments, and as Bamoun decided his next course of action, the fragments began to glow, causing him to implant one fragment into each before they dissipated. Cyrus then ended the experiment, leaving with Cyno, putting them in further decline.

Bamoun and Sethos would later formulate a plan to lure Cyrus back and under the pretense for charging him for his crimes against the Temple, though this was meant to also reconcile with the Akademiya, as Bamoun knew that his successor needed to be freed from the shackles of the past, and they had been estranged with them for many years. As they sought the Ba Fragment from him, and not wanting his adoptive guardian in danger, Cyno proposed an alternate method to resolve the matter via duel. If he won, they would release Cyrus, while if Sethos won, Cyno would release his fragment to Sethos. Cyno and his friends &mdash; the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]] and [[Tighnari]], ultimately win the duel and Bamoun dies, content with the outcome. 

As the Temple was to follow the person with the most fragments, Cyno was made leader; however, with his duties as the [[Matra|General Mahamatra]] and his lack of awareness with the Temple, he decided to appoint Sethos as their leader, knowing that they would be in capable hands with him. Sethos pledged to open the Temple's knowledge to all that he and [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] deemed worthy in return.
