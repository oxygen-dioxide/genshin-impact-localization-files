===Courier Performance Rankings===
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Roll up, roll up, this month's courier performance rankings are out! Star courier [[Adama]], who's been busy preparing for the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame|Pilgrimage]], has fallen down to fifth place!"
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "The champion's position has been seized by none other than his teammate [[Zeila]], who completed an astonishing 110 long-distance deliveries in just twenty days!"
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Could it be that Zeila has been treating delivering letters and packages as a form of training!? Unbelievable stuff... I'm starting to feel bad for the opponents she'll be facing in the upcoming Pilgrimage!"
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Ranked second to tenth, in the following order, we have: [[Tundama]], [[Sausa]], [[Sibu]]... All these couriers will receive a cash prize, plus a special "Yum Yum Yumkasaur" Chew Stick that [[Aclla]] made from the finest quality [[Cacahuatl]]!"
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Other fellow couriers, don't lose heart! Keep up the great work &mdash; maybe next month, the award will be yours!"

===Deliveries to the Flower-Feather Clan===
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "To all couriers delivering to the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]: Please ensure that you drop off your deliveries BEFORE engaging in racing contests with members of the Flower-Feather Clan."
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Otherwise, not only will you most likely lose, given how skilled they are at gliding, but on top of that, you might also damage the contents of your packages. It's just not worth the risk!"

===Hiring a Courier===
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "If you're looking to hire a courier, please head over to the Courier's Longhouse and find the manager, Michica. We only accept commissions on a per-delivery basis, and do not currently offer our services for fixed periods."
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Please also note: Couriers should not be entrusted with the delivery of extremely valuable, fragile, or dangerous items."
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Though our couriers are highly skilled professionals, and you can rest assured that the vast majority of deliveries will arrive safely, we cannot guarantee against unforeseen accidents that may occur along the way..."
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "In the past, certain customers have asked our couriers to deliver packages with the speed of a falcon, across distances exceeding the deserts of [[Sumeru]], with no damage to the packaging whatsoever..."
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Among today's [[Scions of the Canopy]], only [[Kinich]] might be capable of such a task, but sadly he doesn't work as a courier... Anyway, your understanding is greatly appreciated!"

===Gear Feedback===
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Now that Michica has submitted the assessment report to Chief [[Wayna]], the bidding process for the next generation of couriers' standard issue gear is about to begin."
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "As per usual, before finalizing the bidding requirements, we will first gather feedback from the couriers. We encourage you all to share your thoughts&mdash;"
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Let us know which parts of the protective gear are more prone to damage, where screws tend to fall out, and which materials are less resistant to corrosion from moisture and Gaseous Phlogiston... Also, which safety ropes have poor weight-to-durability ratios. The more detailed the feedback, the better."
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "We are well aware that the current usage rate of the standard issue gear is not very high, so we are determined to improve it to ensure that the management fees you all contribute are put to better use!"
:'''Couriers' Announcement:''' "Please don't hesitate to share as many suggestions as possible to let Miss [[Amauta]] know what you value the most!"
