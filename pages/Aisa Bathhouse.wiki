==Descriptions==
{{Description|The Aisa Bathhouse &mdash; a place to warm your heart and soul as you immerse yourself in the glamor of [[Natlan]]. Inspired by the warmth of the Nation of Pyro, the waters of this soothing retreat are said to hold miraculous powers to heal both body and mind. From high-officials to the common folks, it is somewhere for all to unwind and be their true selves. The current operator is [[Aikawa Susumu]], a returnee from Natlan, but rumors tell of a rather special investor working behind the scenes...|Map description}}

==Lore==
Aisa Bathhouse is inspired by volcanic hot springs found in [[Natlan]]. Many [[Tenryou Commission]] samurai often visit, and it is hailed among most Inazumans as a "go-to destination for relaxation."

Sometime following the events of {{Quest|Incandescent Ode of Resurrection}}, the bathhouse underwent a major renovation at the direction of Yumemizuki Mizuki, who had become the bathhouse's core founding investor and decision maker. Among the new services provided by the bathhouse are therapy sessions for guests, which have been met with widespread acclaim.

Yumemizuki Mizuki is currently working on expanding the brand to other locations, such as [[Watatsumi Island]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As Though Caught in a Dream}}</ref> and [["People of the Springs"]] in Natlan.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Yumemizuki's Cozy Corner}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The characters on the sea duck-shaped signboard read "ST" in the [[Inazuman Language]], probably meaning ''{{w|Sentō|sentou}}'' (Japanese communal bathhouse).
* Assuming that a calendar year on Teyvat is generally the same as in the real world, it is suggested that the bathhouse has been in operation for 27 years and nine months.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As Though Kissed by Dew}}</ref>
