===Etymology===
*{{Lang|"{{w|Guicang}}"|zh=归藏|zh_tl=Return to the Hidden}}, {{Lang|"{{w|zh:連山易|Lianshan}}"|zh=连山}}, and {{Lang|"{{w|Zhou Yi}}"|zh=周易|zh_tl=Changes of Zhou}} were three independent ancient Chinese arts of divination collectively known as the {{Lang|"Three Changes"|zh=三易|zh_rm=Sānyì}}. These names are the basis for the three "Hidden Palace of [Name] Formula" domains: Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula, [[Hidden Palace of Lianshan Formula]], and [[Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula]].
* In the original Chinese text, the Ruin Writings' hint is {{zh|循长存者之迹，叩密室之门|tl=To follow in the footsteps of those who live forever, knock on the door to the concealing chamber [lit. 'room for keeping something hidden'].}}
