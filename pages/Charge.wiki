'''Charge''' refers to the number of times an [[Elemental Skill]] can be used without needing to wait for the [[Cooldown]] to expire. Charges should not be confused with Elemental Skills that can accept multiple inputs or with any effects that reset Cooldowns.

The number of Charges is indicated by the number of small squares above the Elemental Skill icon. When a Charge is ready, the corresponding square turns from gray to blue.

The Cooldown for each charge is separate, and only one charge can be refilled per Cooldown period.
