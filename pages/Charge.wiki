'''Charge''' refers to the number of times an Elemental Skill can be used without needing to wait for the [[Cooldown]] to expire. Some [[Elemental Skill]]s have charges, while some [[Constellations]] add charges to Elemental Skills.

The number of Charges is indicated by the number of small squares on the Elemental Skill icon. When a Charge is ready, the corresponding square turns from grey to blue.

The Cooldown for each charge is separate, and only one charge can be refilled per Cooldown period.
