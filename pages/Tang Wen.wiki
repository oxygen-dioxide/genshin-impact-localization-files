==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Transient Dreams]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tang Wen:''' ...
:'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, hello. I was thinking about something, and I didn't notice you. Sorry.
:{{DIcon}} What's on your mind?
::'''Tang Wen:''' I'm thinking of the current situation of Inazuma and the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]]'s policies...
::'''Tang Wen:''' I couldn't return to my hometown to see the [[Rite of Parting]] due to the Sakoku Decree, but somehow, I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, I'm so sorry. I forgot to mention that I'm a historian from Liyue. Although I can't go home for now, I did get a chance to document the change of policy in Inazuma. It's been such a blessing in disguise.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Hmm... About these policies. I still cannot come up with a final conclusion. I think that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must document it completely first.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Therefore, I have decided to stay here for a while and witness future developments in Inazuma.
::{{DIcon}} What was Inazuma like before?
:::'''Tang Wen:''' I think using words like happy or joyful to describe the Inazuma locals back then isn't really accurate... A more appropriate word would be "vigorous."
:::'''Tang Wen:''' The Inazuma locals before the lockdown would still worry about life's troubles. However, they had a vigor then that cannot be matched now.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' People are indeed living stable and peaceful lives, but if you look at the closed borders, the closed shops, and the patrolling samurai who go around seizing Visions... I don't think that anyone can feel at ease in such an oppressive situation.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' And this is not to mention those people whose life took a drastic turn after they lost their Visions.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' Does the Raiden Shogun, who seeks Eternity, really desire an Inazuma that looks like this...
::{{DIcon}} So, what have you heard about the Rite of Parting?
:::'''Tang Wen:''' To be honest, I was really terrified when I learned about [[Rex Lapis]]' passing in a letter from Liyue...
:::'''Tang Wen:''' Aside from being shocked, I also somehow felt regret that I was not in Liyue at such a crucial moment.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' I could only write to my family and my fellow researchers, asking them to document what happened at that time...
:::'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, Rex Lapis lived through thousands of years. If he were still around and saw what's happened in Inazuma, I wonder what he would say...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Goodbye. Perhaps we shall all witness history yet.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Transient Dreams]], while she is located in Inazuma''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tang Wen:''' ...
:'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, hello. I was thinking about something, and I didn't notice you. Sorry.
:{{DIcon}} What's on your mind?
::'''Tang Wen:''' I'm thinking of the current situation of Inazuma and the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]]'s policies...
::'''Tang Wen:''' I couldn't return to my hometown to see the [[Rite of Parting]] due to the Sakoku Decree. But on the other hand, I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, right, sorry. I forgot to mention this before, but I'm a scholar of history from Liyue. I'm presently in Inazuma to record the changes occurring here.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Hmm... Still, I've yet to reach a final conclusion regarding these policies. I think that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must document it completely first.
::'''Tang Wen:''' As such, I 've decided to remain here for a while and witness future developments in Inazuma.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the changes occuring in Inazuma...
:::'''Tang Wen:''' Ever since the Sakoku Decree was abolished, I can feel "life" returning to Inazuma.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' You can see it on people's faces, the way they once again shine with a happiness that can only come from within.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' I believe that this Inazuma reflects the true goal of the Raiden Shogun, who seeks Eternity...
::{{DIcon}} So, what have you heard about the Rite of Parting?
:::'''Tang Wen:''' To be honest, I was really terrified when I learned about Rex Lapis' passing in a letter from Liyue...
:::'''Tang Wen:''' Aside from being shocked, I also somehow felt regret that I was not in Liyue at such a crucial moment.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' I could only write to my family and my fellow researchers, asking them to document what happened at that time...
:::'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, Rex Lapis lived through thousands of years. Were he still to see what's happened in Inazuma, I wonder what he would say...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Goodbye. Perhaps we are witnessing history as it is being made.

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after completing [[Transient Dreams]], while she is located in Liyue''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tang Wen:''' ...
:'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, hello. I was thinking about something, and I didn't notice you. Sorry.
:{{DIcon}} What's on your mind?
::'''Tang Wen:''' I'm thinking about how times can change oh so quickly...
::'''Tang Wen:''' Just like how I couldn't return to Liyue to see the Rite of Parting due to the Sakoku Decree, and yet I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Ah, right, sorry. I forgot to mention this before, but I'm a scholar of history from Liyue. My greatest wish is to see history with my own two eyes.
::'''Tang Wen:''' It is my belief that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must first document it completely.
::'''Tang Wen:''' My time in Inazuma has really got me thinking about how history can be winding, and yet change so very suddenly, too...
::'''Tang Wen:''' Fortunately, I'm no longer some student who needs to worry about her next thesis.
::'''Tang Wen:''' Those graduate students who had Inazuman history as their subject are probably in for it now: in the worst case, they might even have spend{{Sic|expected=spent}} several sleepless nights rewriting their theses.
::{{DIcon}} So, what have you heard about the Rite of Parting?
:::'''Tang Wen:''' To be honest, I was really terrified when I learned about Rex Lapis' passing in a letter from Liyue...
:::'''Tang Wen:''' Aside from being shocked, I also somehow felt regret that I was not in Liyue at such a crucial moment.
:::'''Tang Wen:''' I could only write to my family and my fellow researchers, asking them to document what happened at that time...

:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
