==Other Nations / Regions==
===Khaenri'ah===
{{Main|Khaenri'ah}}
'''Khaenri'ah''' was an ancient civilization that was destroyed 500 years ago with the fall of the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] in an event known as the [[cataclysm]]. Little is known about the country besides the fact that it was an underground civilization located deep below [[Sumeru]] that relied on its form of life-giving alchemy, the [[Art of Khemia]], to survive.

===Celestia===
{{Main|Celestia}}
'''Celestia''' is a floating island in the sky where the [[gods]] are said to reside. Precisely, it is located directly above [[Mt. Mingyuan]]. The people of Teyvat believe that mortals chosen to ascend to godhood will join the pantheon in Celestia.

===Dark Sea===
{{main|Dark Sea}}
The '''Dark Sea''' is a collective term for the regions beyond the continent of Teyvat. It is believed that gods who were defeated in the [[Archon War]] and refused to live under the new order of The Seven fled to the Dark Sea.

===Historical Nations===
The following nations existed in Teyvat at one point but were eventually destroyed or abandoned.

;[[Decarabian's Mondstadt]] (Mondstadt region)
:The original City of Mondstadt was located in what is now known as [[Stormterror's Lair]], under the rule of [[Decarabian]], the God of Storms. His death at the hands of his people led to the rise of Barbatos, who was at the time a mere wind spirit who had allied with the rebels.

;[[Sal Vindagnyr]] (Dragonspine area)
:Long ago, Dragonspine was a verdant mountain. The founders of Sal Vindagnyr discovered it while seeking refuge from a land of snow and strife and settled there, naming the mountain "Vindagnyr." There, they were able to communicate directly with Celestia through divine messengers. However, they eventually met their end when Celestia sent down the [[Skyfrost Nail]], destroying their [[Irminsul]] tree and transforming the area into the blizzard-covered wasteland seen today.

;[[Guili Assembly]] (Liyue region)
:This once-prosperous civilization was jointly ruled by [[Morax]], the Lord of Geo, and [[Guizhong]], the God of Dust. It was destroyed by unknown means, during which Guizhong was slain and the people of this nation were scattered. Morax eventually regathered their people and built Liyue Harbor 3700 years ago.

;[[Sal Terrae]] (Liyue region)
:The last remaining piece of territory held by [[Havria]], the God of Salt, before her death during the Archon War. Because she was a gentle but weak ruler, her people eventually lost their faith in her ability to protect them during wartime and chose to kill her before another god could destroy them, believing it would be a merciful end. However, this only led to their own destruction when the power that surged from her dying body turned everyone in the vicinity into salt.

;[[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] (Liyue region)
:An ancient civilization that existed during the time of the [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|Moon Sisters]]. It shares architectural characteristics with both [[Khaenri'ah]] and [[Enkanomiya]]. It is said to have been filled with genius engineers who were able to repair the solar chariot after it fell to Teyvat after the disaster of the moon sisters. The ancient Chasmfolk also had a great talent for making ceramics out of remnants of the solar chariot, a material known as [[Glazed Sand Crystal]]. The ancient civilization of the Chasm was eventually destroyed by a Celestial nail, and its survivors migrated to [[Chenyu Vale]].

;[[Tsurumi Island]] (Inazuma region)
:Home to two ancient civilizations. The first, known as the [[Pre-Thunderbird Civilization]] has only left behind crumbling remnants in the form of murals underground. The second being the [[Thunderbird Civilization]] as they worshipped the aloof [[Thunderbird]]  that called Tsurumi Island its home. However, after the human sacrifice of the Thunderbird's favorite child, the Thunderbird massacred the second civilization, leaving Tsurumi Island uninhabited and plagued by a vicious Ley Line Disorder.

;[[Watatsumi Island]] (Inazuma region)
:Watatsumi Island was once an independent nation, ruled by the god [[Orobashi]] along with its shrine maidens. Watatsumi coexisted with [[Inazuma]], with both of them respecting each other's borders. However, one day Orobashi attacked Inazuma's Yashiori Island and started a brutal war. During the war, Orobashi was slain by Ei, who was at that time the {{w|Political decoy|kagemusha}} of [[Makoto]], the previous Electro Archon. The de facto rulers of Watatsumi during the war, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]], declared surrender and accepted Baal's rule, and Watatsumi Island was absorbed into Inazuma.

;[[Enkanomiya]] (Inazuma region, below Watatsumi)
:The precursor to the Watatsumi Island civilization and the current record holder for the eldest known civilization. The Enkanomiyans, before being found by Orobashi and rescued, had a relatively thriving underground civilization. They had libraries, research labs, recreational mazes and vivid culture. Enkanomiya was home to an artificial sun that drove away Vishaps, an extremely skilled militia known as the [[Jibashiri]], a ruling faction of nobles who committed fraud and human sacrifice, and historical records with secrets damning enough to condemn gods to an execution by Celestia.

;[[King Deshret|King Deshret's Civilizations]] (Sumeru region)
:Kingdoms and civilizations built by King Deshret in the deserts of Sumeru. It was first the city of [[Ay-Khanoum]], built by him, [[Nabu Malikata]], and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]. Later, their alliance broke; Rukkhadevata separated to form her own kingdom in Dharma Forest, Nabu Malikata passed away, and Deshret went on to create the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|Eternal Oasis]]. Later, the city of [[Gurabad]] was created, and eventually fell. Then, when the first [[Forbidden Knowledge|forbidden knowledge]] plague happened, King Deshret sacrificed himself to seal it, along with Rukkhadevata expending a majority of her power. Deshret's civilization later fell, which led to the birth of several human-led city-states, such as [[Saleh]] and [[Tulaytullah]]. In the end, these cities also fell to ruins, while the survivors built what has become [[Aaru Village]] today.

;[[Remuria]] (Fontaine region)
:An ancient civilization ruled by [[Remus]], who preceded the Hydro Archon [[Egeria]]'s rule. Originally from Sumeru, Remus's land was conquered by King Deshret, leading him to move to Fontaine. There, he gathered followers, conquered other civilizations of the region, and ruled as God King of his new nation, Remuria. However, his nation was fated to crumble due to the [[Prophecy of Fontaine]]. Remus, desperate to maintain his nation, fought hard against it, creating Golems made with his Golden Ichor for his people's souls to inhabit, weaving together the "melodies" of all his people together in an attempt to create one ultimate harmonious symphony to overrule the prophecy and fate that Celestia has cursed them with, and sharing his power and authority with his four Harmosts, humans with great talent to serve him. However, in the end, Remus's attempts to fight against the prophecy failed; he perished and his nation and people sank under the High Sea. Now, remains of Remuria can be found in the [[Sea of Bygone Eras]].

;[[Ochkanatlan]] (Natlan region)
:An ancient civilization in Natlan. Also called the Cinder City, it was once ruled by the tyrant [[Och-Kan]], the Python King. However, after Och-Kan's deposition by the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth]] and his party, it was abandoned and is considered cursed today, with the tribes of Natlan prohibiting anyone from entering the city. The [[Legendary Tonatiuh]] is located here, rumored to be filled with treasure.

;[[Chichen Uctokah]] (Natlan region)
:An ancient civilization located beneath Ochkanatlan ruled by the Dragonlord [[Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L]] (Ixlel). At some point thousands of years ago this civilization fell. Later, Och-Kan made contact with Ixlel when he was excavating the remains of Chichen Uctokah to build Ochkanatlan. After negotiations failed, Och-Kan sealed Ixlel within a statue in the [[Old Core of Chu'ulel]] until the Traveler came in the quest ''[[Open Your Heart to Me]].'' The Traveler freed Ixlel from the statue and her soul rested.

;[[Ancient Sacred Mountain|Sacred City of Tollan]] (Natlan region)
:An ancient dragon civilization located within the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]]. It was where [[Xiuhcoatl]] resided and where the [[Thirteen Sovereign Lords]] of Natlantea deliberate decisions. Built using Secret Source technology, the city consists of layers of floating islands, each with varying purposes. The inside walls of the volcano somehow appears like a bright sunny day. On the bottom layer lies the [[Heart of the Sacred Mountain]], which holds Huitzilopochtli, the mechanism that can turn all of Natlan into liquid phlogiston in order to destroy the Abyss. This city was ravaged and most of the Sovereign Lords were killed by Xbalanque and his army during the Archon War. Today, much of the Sacred City lie in ruin, though the main mechanisms that operate the city still function.
