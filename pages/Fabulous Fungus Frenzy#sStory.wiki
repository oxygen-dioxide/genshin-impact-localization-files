==Summary==
===Act I - The Most Fantastic Tournament You've Never Heard Of?===
{{Main|The Most Fantastic Tournament You've Never Heard Of?}}

Wandering around the outskirts of [[Sumeru City]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] find a bulletin board advertising the [[Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament]] which involves using [[Fungus|Fungi]] to fight. Having fought many fungi in their travels, Paimon worries that the event would be dangerous and suggests to check on it, which the Traveler agrees to. They head to [[Port Ormos]] and discover that whoever wins the Ultimate Trial will inherit [[Elchingen]]'s wealth and become the host for future tournaments.

The two decide to sign up and run into a woman named [[Haniyyah]], who decides to help them get the basics of fungi fighting down in part to help in her own goals too with her main partner [[Kindlejoy|Pyro-1]]. They head around Sumeru and catch two fungi, during which they acquire a [[Floating Hydro Fungus]] which Paimon calls [[Bongo-Head]]. As the participants need four fungi to fight, they find another two before finding a sleepy woman with a [[Floating Anemo Fungus]] near her. Believing the fungus to be dangerous, they move to kill it, but the woman tells them not to and tells them that it's her partner. She introduces herself as [[Layla]] and her fungi as [[Twirly-Whirly]]; she is also participating but is struggling to find three other fungi friends, so Haniyyah helps her out.

Returning to Port Ormos, they soon run into [[Yae Miko]], who likewise is participating in the event for "inspiration." Miko has already acquired her own fungi, a [[Whirling Electro Fungus]] called [[Blitzara]]. One of her accompanying editors, [[Souka]], is also participating in the tournament. As the Traveler and Paimon wonder why Miko had come to Sumeru, Elchingen and [[Kautilya]] greet her before leaving. Miko warns the two that there are "potential liabilities" in the tournament, which the Traveler connects to as the fungi.

They then head to [[Balfour]] to enhance their fungi before the tournament goes underway.

===Act II - Nilotpala Cup: Debut Match===
{{Main|Nilotpala Cup: Debut Match}}

After enhancing their fungi, the Traveler faces [[Ajilenakh Dash]] and defeats her team with ease. They catch up with Layla and Miko, who likewise breezed through their opposition. Miko suggests some "training" to help keep the momentum from their wins and they arrive at the location, where she reveals that they're going to simply bond with the fungi. Layla theorizes that the fungi can be tamed and wonders what would happen if the Wisdom Orb was shut off. Deciding to do so with assurances from Miko and the Traveler, Twirly-Whirly begins to go about on its own business without attacking anyone. The Traveler does the same for Bongo-Head before hearing cries of help in the distance.

Investigating the source, they discover two children being threatened by wild fungi, but Haniyyah appears and drives them off. Haniyyah then reveals to the Traveler that she intends to win the tournament to eliminate all the fungi, including her own partner. Miko and Layla come in and the former dismisses them. Returning to the port, Layla decides to write a letter to the [[Amurta]] school to find out what the fungi like to eat before the Traveler notices a [[Corps of Thirty]] member, believing that [[Cyno]] has tabs on the event. They also discover their next opponent is Souka, although Miko tells them not to worry about defeating her.

===Act III - Dual Missions: Progress and Probe!===
{{Main|Dual Missions: Progress and Probe!}}

The Traveler easily defeats Souka before meeting up with Miko and Layla, who likewise defeated their opponents. Layla worries about the opponents' strength and decides to continue training with Twirly-Whirly, although she also reveals that she has a meeting with the [[Dori|Almighty Merchant]]. Miko gives the task to the Traveler instead to alleviate her worries before telling them to investigate the Floral Jelly formula at sunrise.

When sunrise hits, the Traveler and Paimon find the formula for the jelly lying in the stall and use their [[Kamera]] to take a photo of it. They then make their way to the outskirts of Sumeru City to meet up with the Almighty Merchant, who's actually Dori. She gives them some discarded scraps of them for free, having been given it by someone who saw a chance with it. She then looks at the order and agrees to send the shipment to Layla before making her leave.

Returning to the tournament, the Traveler faces [[Baron Bigfoot]] and easily defeats his team. Layla likewise also defeated her opponent, although she notes that they're becoming much stronger. She also reveals that she saw Miko and Souka with a Corps of Thirty member but chose not to follow them. Paimon then tells the Traveler to compile their evidence to give to Miko.

===Act IV - Unfathomable Defenses===
{{Main|Unfathomable Defenses}}

The Traveler goes up against [[Hardy Two-Blades]] and defeats him, although his cruelty on the fungi disappoints Paimon. Layla also defeated her opponent and takes note of Paimon's sadness. Miko then arrives, having defeated her opponent and is now going against Haniyyah in the semi-finals, while the Traveler would be facing Layla.

Layla, having no qualms about winning or losing, asks her team to play fairly. The Traveler defeats her team before leaving, where they learn that Haniyyah had defeated Miko, thus making the Traveler have to face her in the finals. Miko advises Haniyyah to change her mind before it would go bad for her, but she refuses and leaves. The Traveler proceeds to give Miko the evidence they accumulated, who in turn blesses them with her gohei. She also suggests they speak with her where they met Layla.

Arriving at the place they met Layla, the Traveler tracks Haniyyah down using their [[Elemental Sight]] to track Pyro-1. Haniyyah reveals why she despises fungi, giving them her [[Haniyyah's Notes|notebook]] before leaving. Investigating further, they soon discover that Kautilya is a scam and that Bongo-Head is traveling with them of its own volition, as the Traveler turned their orb off. Unsure of what to do, they decide to finish the finals and inform Elchingen of Kautilya's deception.

===Act V - The Strongest Opponent! The Biggest Crisis!===
{{Main|The Strongest Opponent! The Biggest Crisis!}}

Returning to the arena once more, the Traveler faces Haniyyah's team with Bongo-Head, Twirly-Whirly, Blitzara and a fungi of their choice. They defeat her team, making them eligible for the "Ultimate Trial." Before leaving, they ask her if they could take Pyro-1, which she agrees to. Elchingen appears and brings them to another area of the domain, where they find [[Fatui Skirmisher]]s waiting for them. Elchingen reveals himself to be a Fatuus working for [[Il Dottore]] and that he intends to grow a fungi army to create havoc in Sumeru, even throwing Kautilya under the bus to accomplish his goal. He then uses the Wisdom Orb to control Twirly-Whirly, Blitzara and Pyro-1.

Bongo-Head repels the brainwashed fungi, leaving Elchingen confused as to why the backdoor command wouldn't work on it. Miko, Layla and Haniyyah then arrive, the former having broken straight into the domain. They break the control on the fungi, but Elchingen believes that he still has the advantage and orders the skirmishers to attack. However, they fungi defeat them and he flees the domain. Chasing him, they find [[Sido]] and the Corps of Thirty having apprehended Elchingen and Kautilya and drag them away to face judgement.

Haniyyah apologizes to the Traveler for her misguided view, who forgives her. As they had technically won the Ultimate Trial, the Traveler and Paimon decide to take position of hosts for the event and reveal the conspiracy behind the tournament. However, as they had fun, she also tells them that the tournament would continue, although put on hold until they could find a way for everyone to safely participate in the event. Haniyyah would also be responsible for taking care of the fungi, which she takes up.

===Act VI - Farewell, My Shroom Buddies===
{{Main|Farewell, My Shroom Buddies}}

After spending some final quality time with their fungi, the Traveler and Layla see Miko off, who leaves Blitzara in their care. They then catch up to Haniyyah at the outskirts of Port Ormos, who reveals that she had taken the remaining orbs and fungi. She had also renamed her fungi Kindlejoy, admitting she felt joy when she tamed the fungi. She also reveals to have found an ideal spot to take care of the fungi and promises her utmost to care for them and takes the remaining fungi before leaving.

::'''Message Board:''' You idiot! The audience won't be able to understand what's going on if the competition becomes too complicated!
::'''Message Board:''' Everyone's just here to have a good time. Nobody wants to count dumb points and guess strategies while watching the competition!
