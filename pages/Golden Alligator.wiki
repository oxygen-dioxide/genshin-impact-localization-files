==Profile==
Golden Alligator is the leader of a small group of Treasure Hoarders. He and his crew were searching for treasure when they were interrupted by Beidou and the [[Traveler]]. Fearful of Beidou, he and his men tried to flee, but she stopped them and allowed them to claim the treasure as they found it first. He chose to give it to her, who in turn would use her connections to help him and his men find honest jobs around [[Liyue Harbor]] before allowing the group to leave.

As they walked around, he and his men, left impressed by Beidou's values, decided to accept her offer and helped them find the treasure, which was revealed to be a check for [[Northland Bank]], some [[Sakura Bloom]]s and a letter from a son to his mother. Beidou then had Golden Alligator and his men deliver the contents to the son's mother, [[Minamoto Kotomi]].

===Personality===
Like many Treasure Hoarders, Golden Alligator and his crew only became associated with them as they had no Mora to meet their daily needs. They were somewhat uncontent with their work. He tried his best to maintain a spirit of camaraderie with his men, giving equal shares to all if they had found treasure. He is aware of Beidou's reputation; after meeting her by chance and her ethical conduct, he and the others chose to abandon the Treasure Hoarders and set their lives straight, hoping to work on the Crux one day.
