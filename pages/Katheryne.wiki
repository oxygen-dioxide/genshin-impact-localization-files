{{Quote|Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.|Katheryne|upon greeting the player
}}
'''Katheryne''' is the receptionist for the [[Adventurers' Guild]]. She can be found at the guild's headquarters located in each of [[Teyvat]]'s seven nations, indicated by the {{DIcon|AdvGuild}} icon on the map.

She assigns quests for guild members including the [[Traveler]], as well as intel about incidents occurring in the area.

By speaking to her, you can:
# Claim Bonus Daily [[Commission]] Rewards
#Claim [[Adventure Rank]] Rewards
# Dispatch Characters on [[Expeditions]]

Multiple, identical Katherynes exist, all serving as the guild's receptionists. It is unknown if they have separate wills and memories, as dialogue in Chapter 2, Part 4 implies the Katheryne seen in Liyue has a connection with the one the Traveler meets in Inazuma. It is highly implied that she may be an android or some kind of artificial being, based on her idle quotes, identical appearance regardless of location, a keyhole-shaped embellishment on the back of her collar, and her occasional tendency to robotically say "Error" and "Rebooting."
