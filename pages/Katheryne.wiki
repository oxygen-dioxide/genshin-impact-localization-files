{{Quote|Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.|Katheryne|upon greeting the player}}
'''Katheryne''' is the receptionist for the [[Adventurers' Guild]]. She can be found at the Guild's headquarters located in each of [[Teyvat]]'s seven nations, indicated by the {{DIcon|AdvGuild}} icon on the map.

She assigns quests for Guild members including the [[Traveler]], as well as intel about incidents occurring in the area.

By speaking to her, you can:
# Claim Bonus Daily [[Commission]] Rewards
# Claim [[Adventure Rank]] Rewards
# Dispatch Characters on [[Expeditions]]

Multiple, identical Katherynes exist, all serving as the Guild's receptionists. It is unknown if they have separate wills and memories, as dialogue in the {{Quest|Requiem of the Echoing Depths}} implies the Katheryne seen in Liyue has a connection with the one the Traveler meets in Inazuma. She is confirmed to be a bionic [[Snezhnaya]]n puppet at the end of the {{Quest|Dawn (Quest)}}.<ref name="Dawn">{{Ref/Quest|Dawn (Quest)}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* "Ad Astra Abyssosque," which she always says when you first speak to her, is Latin for "To the Stars and the Abyss."
* Before confirmation of her identity as a bionic [[Snezhnaya]]n puppet by [[Nahida]],<ref name="Dawn" /> it was highly implied that she may be an android, or some other kind of artificial being, based on her idle quotes (i.e., where she robotically says "Error" and "Rebooting"), identical appearance regardless of location, and a keyhole-shaped embellishment on the back of her collar.
** Katheryne has maintenance personnel who look after her wellbeing.
** As Nahida values her people's free will, she does not attempt to occupy their consciousness through their [[Akasha System|Akasha Terminal]] without an excellent reason. When necessary, she connects to the Sumeru Katheryne through the puppet's Akasha Terminal and borrows her instead.
* Katheryne bears a strong resemblance to the Fatui Harbinger, [[Sandrone]]. Considering Sandrone's interest in mechanical research, and Katheryne being of Snezhnayan origin, this may mean that Sandrone was involved in Katheryne's creation. 
* {{Furnishing Mentions}}
