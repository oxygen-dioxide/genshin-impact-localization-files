==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Oroluk:''' Hello, are you here to interact with our adorable little fishies? Do you need any help from me or the Fishing Association?
:{{DIcon|Fishing Supplies}} I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
::'''Oroluk:''' Well, I don't have much stock here, but quality, at least, is guaranteed. Please take a look around~
:;(Opens the [[#Shop|Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} Adorable...?
::'''Oroluk:''' Yes. Just see how they swim, ever so carefree, waggling their tails, in river, lake, or sea...
::'''Oroluk:''' Well, I personally find them cute, and if you don't feel the same &mdash; well, that's okay, too!
::'''Oroluk:''' I signed up for the Fishing Association to see, catch, and raise more {{sic|cutie-pies}} fishies.
::'''Oroluk:''' However, some people are only into fishing for the delicious meat &mdash; or to sell them for Mora.
::'''Oroluk:''' I mean, I get it, but I don't get involved. Most of my Association chums respect me, too.
::'''Oroluk:''' Naturally, I also hope {{sic|the}} even more people can get to know just how adorable fish are~
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Oroluk:''' Good day. I'm Oroluk, and I'm one of the staff here at the Natlan Fishing Association.
::'''Oroluk:''' If you want to buy special Natlan fishing gear and bait, just leave the legwork up to me!
::'''Oroluk:''' If you find things a bit remote out here, you can always leave a message at Atlahua's Net. I'm [[Yelafath|the owner]]'s friend, and I often go there to make purchases, too!
::'''Oroluk:''' But as for fishing, I'm just your average angler. I'll keep on practicing and improving, though!
:{{DIcon}} See you later, then!
::'''Oroluk:''' Alright. Y'know, I've got a feeling that you're a skilled fisher... See you next time, then!
