<!--
Below is an old note; remove it after we're sure both Pyro versions work the same way.
Notable discrepancies with what's stated in the notes above: 1) not using the active character's crit stats? 2) damage doesn't reset when character is switched off field?

Note:Damage starts at 2 every 2 seconds; ramps up (by some value between 2 and 2.5) every tick to a max of 52 every 2 seconds; seems to be able to CRIT with ~5% chance for 50% extra damage); ramps separately for each character (so switching to a new character resets the damage; then, switching back to the original character continues where it left off).
