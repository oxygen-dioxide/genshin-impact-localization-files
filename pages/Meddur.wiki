'''Meddur''' was an [[The Eremites|Eremite]] and a member of the [[Tanit]] tribe. 

==Profile==
Meddur's name is mentioned by [[Jeht]] when the [[Traveler]] encounters her after her capture by the [[Fatui]], and also appears struck out on the [[Crumpled Namelist]] in Jeht's tent in the [[Tanit Camps]]. Given this context, [[Babel]] presumably ordered Jeht to assassinate them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...}}</ref>
