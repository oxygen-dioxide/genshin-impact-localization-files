|description     = A meat dish drizzled with sauce.
|desc_suspicious = Nothing seems wrong here at first, but in time, you will know the tragic extent of your failings. Poultry made without trimming off some fat and oil is far too greasy to swallow, and even its combination with vegetables cannot save this dish.
|desc_basic      = The fowl is marinated before being covered in batter and fried, and a thick sauce is drizzled over it as a finishing touch. The accompanying vegetables are local produce, but the marinating methods and sauce are all imported, hence the name "imported poultry."
|desc_delicious  = Having been marinated beforehand, the fowl has had several layers of flavor added to it, keeping its oiliness in perfect moderation. Bite down on that crispy, cracking flour-skin, and feel the rich juices of the fowl rush into your mouth and whet your appetite.

==Trivia==
*Considering its name, description, and its white sauce that resembles tartar sauce, the dish likely refers to {{Lang|chicken nanban|ja=チキン南蛮|ja_rm=chikin nanban|ja_tl=exotic chicken dish}}, a Western-influenced Japanese fried chicken dish.
**The Japanese term  {{Lang|''nanban''|ja={{wt|南蛮}}}} came from the classical Chinese word ''{{w|Nanman|nánmán}}'' ("southern barbarians") and was originally used as a derogatory term for Portuguese and Spanish people in feudal periods. Today, however, it lost derogatory connotations and just refers to foreign cooking methods and imported ingredients which are considered pleasantly exotic (marinating methods and tartar sauce in this case).
