{{Description|A plant species that only grows in certain regions and islands of the ocean. Though it looks like a fungus of some sort, it actually comes from a substance secreted by certain soft-bodied organisms.<br />In the folktales told in a certain land, these mouthless, noseless creatures are the transformed souls of children who died young. As a form of punishment, they must spend endless years absorbing the elements within the sand and sea using their fragile bodies, piling them up and forming "Sea Ganoderma." And once the Ganoderma are fully formed, they shall be harvested.}}

==Trivia==
*Sea Ganoderma could be found in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] during [[Version 1.6]]. It was one of three Local Specialties that could be obtained then, the others being [[Dandelion Seed]]s from [[Mondstadt]] and [[Starconch]]es from [[Liyue]].
**During Version 1.6, it was labeled as a "Regional Specialty."
*It was first mentioned by [[Yae]] in the Chinese Version 1.5 Special Program, where she says that she brought two baskets of it for [[Ganyu]] to try.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17y4y147fa 1.5{{Lang|zh=版本「玉扉绕尘歌」特别节目——璃月雅集}}SP]</ref>
*{{w|Ganoderma}} is a genus of mushrooms used in {{w|traditional Chinese medicine}}, which was considered the "mushroom of immortality" in ancient times.
**The Korean name for {{Lang|Ganoderma|ko=불로초(不老草)|ko_rm=Bullocho}} literally means "grass of eternal youth."
*Sea Ganoderma resembles {{w|Auricularia auricula-judae|wood ear mushrooms}}, a common ingredient in East Asian dishes. However, despite being described as fungus-like, Sea Ganoderma actually "comes from a substance secreted by certain soft-bodied organisms." By contrast, the Japanese name for wood ear mushrooms, ''kikurage'' ({{Lang|mini=1|ja=キクラゲ}}, lit. "wood jellyfish"), belies the fact that it is a fungus and not a jellyfish.
*In Japan, the {{w|Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic}} name of the genus Ganoderma literally means {{Lang|"genus of ten-thousand-year mushrooms"|ja=マンネンタケ属|ja_rm=Mannentake-zoku}}.<ref>Japanese Wikipedia: {{w|ja:マンネンタケ科|マンネンタケ科}}</ref>
