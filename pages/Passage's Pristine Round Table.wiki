|description    = A round wooden table commonly found in the [[Court of Fontaine]], these tables are the most diligent "employees" in various food establishments. [[Café Lutece]] is perhaps the most well-known establishment featuring these round tables. Made from the finest [[Linden Wood]] and covered with a uniquely-styled tablecloth which has been coated with a thin layer of wax by [[Clockwork Meka|clockwork meka]]. This coat provides a splash-resistant surface that can be easily cleaned with water without leaving visible stains. Legend has it that this waxing process was inspired by the fishers of [[Poisson]]. They discovered a long time ago that applying wax to ship sails prevented staining and excessive water absorption during rainy weather.<br>However, with the advent of new devices to power ships, fewer Poisson residents are familiar with this process, and fewer still are concerned with the history of a tablecloth's finishing technique.
