;今天是罗莎莉亚的生日哦，我们快去为她庆祝吧！
:'''罗莎莉亚：'''倒卖假酒的是你么？
:'''小贩：'''我卖的是正宗蒙德蒲公英酒，你看，蒲公英还在里面…
:'''罗莎莉亚：'''看来，你需要一些帮助。
:'''旅行者：'''需要我们帮你回忆这些酒里加了什么，是么？
:'''派蒙：'''哼哼，我们的帮助，可是另外的价钱，你考虑清楚！
:'''小贩：'''欸？等等，我说我说，加了一点外面果酒湖的湖水&mdash;&mdash;只是为了降低酒的烈度，绝对不是假酒啊！
:'''罗莎莉亚：'''哼，白费口舌…把他和酒一起带回去审问就好。速战速决，快到下班时间了。

;Today is [[Rosaria]]'s birthday, let's go and celebrate with her!
:'''Rosaria:''' Are you the guy who's been making fake wine to resell?
:'''Peddler:''' I only sell authentic Mondstadt [[Dandelion Wine]]! Look, I still have the Dandelions...
:'''Rosaria:''' Looks like you could still use a little nudge.
:'''Traveler:''' Need a little help recalling what you added to the wine?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, our help will come at an additional cost. You better think this through!
:'''Peddler:''' Huh? Wait, I'll talk, I'll talk! I did add a bit of water from [[Cider Lake]] to the wine, but only to dilute the intensity of the alcohol! This isn't some fake wine, I swear!
:'''Rosaria:''' Hmph, what a waste of time... Take him and his wine in for questioning. Let's make this quick. It's nearly the end of my shift.
