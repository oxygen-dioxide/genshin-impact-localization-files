==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Terada:''' Hey! Where did you come from?
:'''Terada:''' No commoners are allowed in the military zone! Leave the area now!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Terada:''' Can't you see that from my gear? I'm a soldier. I'm here on a special mission.
::'''Terada:''' Heh, an outlander like you should watch yourself. Don't cause any trouble, or I'll see you brought to justice.
::{{DIcon}} What sort of mission are you on?
:::'''Terada:''' What kind of mission, you ask... What kind of mission do you think it would be, in a place like this?!
:::'''Terada:''' Of course it's... uh, to eradicate evil... and slay all the rebel remnants!
:::'''Terada:''' Yea, that's all you need to know! You wouldn't understand even if I told you more.
::{{DIcon}} Is this a solo mission?
:::'''Terada:''' Can't you see that I have a follower right here?.
:::'''Terada:''' Well, not that an elite such as myself needs that many people to complete my mission.
:::'''Terada:''' Be they rebels or evil lords, I can take care of them with one slash. I don't need others to help me.
::{{DIcon}} That seems suspicious, I'm going to report you.
:::'''Terada:''' Hey! W&mdash;W&mdash;Wait a minute. What are you doing? Let's talk this out nicely...
:::'''Terada:''' I'm not bothering anyone else, and I'm not up to no good. Just let me be already!
:::'''Terada:''' I'm just a samurai on patrol, that's all. Let's go our separate ways, please.
:::'''Terada:''' If you keep messing with me like this, outlander, *I'll* report *you* to my superiors! You'd better watch out, because they're gonna come for you!
:{{DIcon}} Well, see you...
::'''Terada:''' Scram!
