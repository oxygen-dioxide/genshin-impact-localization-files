The '''Ritou Bulletin Board''' is a message board located near the eastern [[Teleport Waypoint]] in [[Ritou]]. The messages randomly cycle through every time it is interacted with. The first set of messages is replaced after completing [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s first [[Story Quest]], ''[[Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing]]''.

The Ritou Harbor Bulletin Board is a different message board also located in Ritou, found next to [[Kageyama]]. Several messages are shared between these two message boards, particularly Arrest Warrants and notices from the [[Tri-Commission]].
