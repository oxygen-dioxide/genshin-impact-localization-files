|text1    = The Wayob worshipped by the various tribes of Natlan manifest themselves in the form of these obsidian totems. In battle, the Wayob Manifestation will deploy its Arena: Moment of Trial, creating a shield for itself and absorbing the Elemental Energy of all characters in the Arena. Characters in the Arena deal greatly increased DMG. {{Color|help|If the shield is broken before the Arena expires}}, they will also regain a large amount of Energy. However, if they fail to break the shield, the Manifestation will generate a barrier based on the value of the remaining Elemental Shield.
