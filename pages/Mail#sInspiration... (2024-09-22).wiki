|text      = When I wish to clear my scattered thoughts, venturing into the outdoors is always a lovely choice.

The grass after the rain, driftwood washed by gentle waves, and the evening breeze brushing through a flower garden... Nature always holds a certain calming power.

This evening, I passed by some willow trees by the lake, and a delicate fragrance of [[Lakelight Lily|Lakelight Lilies]] floated on the wind. As I quietly inhaled, the elegant scent lingered softly, like a longtime neighbor who never imposes. Following this invisible thread, it brought to mind many people and memories...

I believe I've found new inspiration.

Please accept this bouquet, and do look forward to my next perfume creation. I would be delighted to hear your thoughts once you've tried it.
