{{Quest Description|You hear about Sunset Vermillionite from [[Baizhu]] and decide to hit up [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]] for some information.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the Feiyun Commerce Guild)
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xu 01.ogg}} '''Xu:''' Master Xingqiu! Thank goodness you're finally back!
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh? Why do I detect an urgency in your voice?
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xu 02.ogg}} '''Xu:''' The Guild has had a whole string of strange orders in recently. Everyone's been completely caught off guard.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xu 03.ogg}} '''Xu:''' Your father gave me specific instructions to ask you to stay and help out if I happened to see you.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I see. Have someone sort the orders by type for now. I'll deal with them myself shortly.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xu 04.ogg}} '''Xu:''' Oh, how wonderful... Thank you, Master. With you on the job, I can breathe a sigh of relief.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Xingqiu! Glad you're here!
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We want to ask you for some information.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Traveler, Paimon, please wait a moment.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Xu, I need to entertain some guests. Please continue with your work for the time being, and we'll discuss the matter of the Guild's orders in more detail later on.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xu 05.ogg}} '''Xu:''' Understood, Master Xingqiu. Then I will leave you in peace.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I wasn't counting on finding you here today. What's going on? And how, pray tell, may I be of service?
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xingqiu, have you ever heard of "Sunset Vermillionite"?
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh, I see. So you've entered Lady [[Ningguang]]'s contest as well.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "As well"? Do you mean...
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' The truth is, the Feiyun Commerce Guild is in possession of some Sunset Vermillionite, but only one piece.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' We are holding it on behalf of someone who has asked us to put it up for auction. And a lot of interested parties have already come to us inquiring about the price.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' At the end of the day, it all comes down to supply and demand. In this case, I'm guessing the final transaction price may be in excess of 500 million Mora.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' 500 million!?
:{{DIcon}} That's so expensive...
:{{DIcon}} I don't think I can afford it.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Honestly, I would recommend that you don't bother bidding on this one. The price is greatly inflated, and it's just not worth it.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But without any Sunset Vermillionite...
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Don't panic. I don't suppose you've ever heard of [[Sea Gazer]]?
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who?
:{{DIcon}} Never heard of them.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Sea Gazer was once very close to [[Mountain Shaper]]. But if I am not mistaken, he has already passed away.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Yes, precisely... I didn't know anyone else knew about him.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 13.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' According to "Records of Drifting Clouds," Sea Gazer once built an abode to store his rarest and most exquisite treasures &mdash; among which was some Sunset Vermillionite.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 14.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' After Sea Gazer passed, the abode was abandoned, and its location was lost to time.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 15.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Luckily, I came into possession of a stack of folk history books just recently. They make some oblique references to this lost abode, and after cross-referencing them against each other, I'm now fairly certain that it is situated in the [[Lisha]] area.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's great! ...But is it really okay for us to just go and take his treasure?
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wouldn't it be a little... y'know... disrespectful? With him being an [[adeptus]]?
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' You needn't worry. As far as I understand, Sea Gazer was very open-minded. Even while he was alive, he wouldn't have let something like this bother him.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 16.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Open-minded...? I have not heard of Sea Gazer being described in this way before. May I ask where you read that?
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Just a rumor I heard out in the mountains. Alright then, let's go.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 17.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hmm, there's something about this young lady that reminds me of a [[Chongyun|good friend of mine]]...
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 xingqiu 18.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh, I almost forgot &mdash;adepti abodes tend to have very ingenious designs, especially when it comes to their defense mechanisms. Plus, it's likely to be crawling with monsters after being abandoned for so long. So please, be very careful.
:{{A|vo shlq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay! We will be. Thanks, Xingqiu!

;(Talk to Xingqiu again)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It looks like the [[Jade Chamber]] rebuilding project will be fiercely competitive. It's difficult to say who will emerge as the winner.
{{Dialogue end}}

{{Quest Description|update|According to Xingqiu, Sea Gazer's abode should contain Sunset Vermillionite. Time to try your luck.}}
<section begin=domaindialogue/>
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the marked spot)
:{{A|vo shlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see... Xingqiu said it should be around here. But Paimon doesn't see anything...
;(Shenhe performs sigil magic<!-- what is it called? -->)
:{{A|vo shlq002 2 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' This place was hidden using a special adepti art. But now that I have removed it, we can inspect the area more closely.
:{{A|vo shlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's amazing! Yep, let's take another look around...
:{{A|vo shlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! Is that a new Seelie over there?

;(Approach the waterfall)
:{{A|vo shlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Seelie got to here and then disappeared. Should we go over and take a look?
----
;(Enter the domain)
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wha... Weren't we at a waterfall just now? How did we suddenly end up here?
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So many clouds... It feels like we're high up in the sky.
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I believe this is the abode of that adeptus.
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' With any luck, the Sunset Vermillionite we're looking for should be in here.
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Let Paimon see... Huh? Isn't that the Seelie from before?
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, it's gone and snuck beneath the clouds!
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And now that Paimon takes a closer look, the rocks and trees here don't seem complete... Could there be something below the clouds?
:{{DIcon}} What do you think, Shenhe?
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' These are not real clouds. They are the product of an adepti art used for spatial partitioning.
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' If we want to go down, we must first destroy the mechanism that is maintaining the adepti art.
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Then let's do it!
:{{A|vo shlq002 4 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I sense the presence of monsters in this place. I don't know where they are hiding, so we'd better be careful.

;(Approach the core after unlocking it)
:{{A|vo shlq002 5 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' It appears that we've been taken for intruders... This time, why not allow me to take care of this.

;(After defeating the opponenets)
:{{A|vo shlq002 5 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' The core of the mechanism is exposed. Now's our chance!

;(After destroying the core)
:'''The mechanism is broken and the fog clears along with it...'''

:{{A|vo shlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, w—we're going to faaaall!!
:{{A|vo shlq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is everyone okay?
:{{A|vo shlq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, the Seelie has disappeared beneath the clouds again!
:{{A|vo shlq002 6 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' It looks like we need to go further down. But before that, let's destroy the guard mechanisms on this level first.

;(After destroying the core on second level)
:{{A|vo shlq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're gonna fall! This time we're really going to fall, aaaah!!!
:{{A|vo shlq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So high... We can't even see to the bottom!
:{{A|vo shlq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Luckily there was a pool of water at the bottom. Otherwise, that could have ended very differently...
:{{A|vo shlq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, that Seelie's on the move again! Let's catch up with it!

;(Approach the wall)
:{{A|vo shlq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Something looks different about this stone wall. Let's take a closer look.

;(Touch a wall that cannot be moved)
:''The rock does not budge an inch...''

;(Follow the seelie)
:{{A|vo shlq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look over there, could that be the Sunset Vermillionite?

;(Approach the Plaustrite)
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this it? Is this the Sunset Vermillionite?
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's so huge...
:{{DIcon}} So is the Jade Chamber.
:{{DIcon}} It needs to be big to get the whole Jade Chamber airborne.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true. But then again... why isn't it floating?
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Plaustrite doesn't float until it's activated. It may look different from most ordinary stones, but it weighs around the same amount.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Only after being activated does Plaustrite reveal its true nature, breaking free from the shackles of the mortal realm and ascending up into the heavens.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Shenhe! You seem to know everything about this!
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Only because my master is fond of chatting about these things. The moment she has some time to spare, she'll come straight for me and start telling story after story.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I don't care for her stories most of the time. I certainly didn't expect them to ever come in handy like this.
:{{DIcon}} I wonder who this master is...
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on a sec! Paimon just realized something!
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we activate it here, there's no way we'll be able to get it back to the site, right? Heck, we'll be dragged up into the sky, too.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if we don't activate it, how else are we gonna lift it? This rock must weigh well over a thousand pounds, surely?
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Don't worry. I can handle the weight quite easily.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you sure? Uhh, be careful!
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Please, don't worry. I'm well aware that a Plaustrite sample this large must be highly valuable. I will be gentle with it and make sure it does not get damaged.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon meant you, Shenhe.
:{{DIcon}} It's your safety you have to be careful of.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...My safety?
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! Paimon's sure you can handle it and everything, but if something this heavy lands on you, you're gonna get yourself hurt, no matter who you are.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You gotta be extra careful when lifting heavy objects. It's just common sense!
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Is it, now... Well then, thank you.
:{{A|vo shlq002 10 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I'll go on ahead with the Plaustrite. Let's meet at the building site later.

:'''Shenhe lifts up the Plaustrite and leaves.'''

:{{A|vo shlq002 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How was Shenhe able to carry that huge rock all by herself!? Hmm... adepti super-strength, much?
:{{A|vo shlq002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), we can't slow down yet. Let's go meet her at the building site!

;(If you talk to Siqin)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 siqin 01.ogg}} '''Siqin:''' We had a handful of scoundrels try to sneak in and steal some supplies earlier. I caught them, and they'll be dealt with according to the law.

;(If you talk to Liang)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 bright 01.ogg}} '''Liang:''' I heard a good few of my comrades have been sent over to [[Guyun Stone Forest]]. I sure hope they'll be safe out there...

;(If you talk to Anshun)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 anshun 01.ogg}} '''Anshun:''' I heard that Lady [[Keqing]] has gone to Guyun Stone Forest.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 anshun 02.ogg}} '''Anshun:''' She took a lot of our workers with her, too. So does that mean there's another construction project going on over there as well?

;(If you talk to Changfeng)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 changfeng 01.ogg}} '''Changfeng:''' That young lady who carried the Plaustrite in earlier... she's gotta be an adeptus, surely...

;(If you talk to Leming)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 leming 01.ogg}} '''Leming:''' Now we have the Plaustrite, the real construction work can finally begin! I think everyone's going to be very busy from this point onwards. Me especially.

;(If you talk to Lizheng)
:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 lizheng 01.ogg}} '''Lizheng:''' You again? Can't you see that I'm trying to work!? Look, if you wanna chat, find me at dinnertime, okay!

:{{A|vo dialog shlq002 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' What brings you here? You'll have to make it quick, I'm afraid, I really can't afford to chat for too long.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing out here?
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01a.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' As you can see, we're working on a construction project.
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01a 1.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Personally, I consider this project to be of greater importance than the Jade Chamber rebuild. That's why I'm here to supervise.
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01a 2.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I just hope we can complete it on schedule...
:{{DIcon}} What is this?
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01b.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' A new type of [[Guizhong Ballista]].
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01b 1.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ningguang commissioned an expert to dismantle and study the Guizhong Ballista, and design an improved version based on the original.
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01b 2.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' This design is a step down from the adepti's original Guizhong Ballista in terms of firing speed and power, but the good thing about it is that it can be mass-produced.
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01b 3.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's also considerably easier to assemble and disassemble. This will allow for flexible deployment, whatever the location.
::{{A|vo shlq002 12 keqing 01b 4.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I am confident it will prove very useful in dealing with future crises.<section end="Keqing" />

:{{A|vo shlq002 12 baiwen 03.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Ah, so you're the ones behind this. No wonder. The rarest talent turns in the rarest Plaustrite specimen.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 baiwen 04.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' But I have to correct you on one point. It's not "helper." It's "secretary."
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Okay then, Miss Secretary, what do you think of the rock we found? Pretty amazing, right?
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 baiwen 05.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' In truth, it is the finest piece of Plaustrite we have received so far.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 baiwen 06.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' If everything goes according to plan, we will use this piece in the foundation of the Jade Chamber, which will enable us to proceed to the next stage of construction.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 baiwen 07.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' As a side note, Lady Ningguang has rented some dwellings in the nearby area to serve as accommodations for the contestants. If you need a place to rest, you are welcome to stay there.

:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What kind of reaction is that!? So strange, aren't you happy about it?
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whenever Paimon gets praised, Paimon can't help but hold her head up high and break into a big, smug smile!
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I've had similar compliments before.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' They call me an adeptus, treat me with great deference and respect, as if I'm set apart from the common folk.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... 'cause that's how adepti are. At least, the ones we've met are pretty unique and reclusive, too. Way different than normal people.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' But I am not... Ugh.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shenhe?
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I'm fine. I've been exerting myself quite a lot ever since we set foot in that abode. I'm just a little fatigued.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ummm... Well, Baiwen said that there are some makeshift hotels we can use, right? Let's go check in and take a rest!
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' No need. I simply need to find myself a secluded place in the wilderness to sit and meditate in silence.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can't do that! It's dangerous out in the wild on your own!
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When you're hungry, you go eat something tasty, and when you're tired, you go lie down in a nice comfy bed, alright? Seriously, don't punish yourself like this.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon is right!
:{{DIcon}} Guest accommodations are far more comfortable than the wilderness.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...Okay. If you insist.
:{{A|vo shlq002 12 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great, now we're talking. Let's head to our hotel, (Traveler)!

:{{A|vo shlq002 13 juan 02.ogg}} '''Ju'an:''' Since this was chosen as the building site for the new Jade Chamber, we've had a constant stream of people in this area. And not just workers, either &mdash; visitors, business people, tea sellers, all sorts.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 juan 03.ogg}} '''Ju'an:''' So business is booming for me today. Very few vacancies. You're lucky you got here when you did!
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great!
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 juan 04.ogg}} '''Ju'an:''' One of your rooms is still being cleaned, I guess it should be ready within the hour. The other room is just through the door on the left.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 juan 05.ogg}} '''Ju'an:''' Here are your keys... Alright, hope you enjoy your stay. Please excuse me, I'll leave you to it.
;(Ju'an leaves)
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shenhe, you should go get some rest. We'll hang around outside until the other room's ready.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna go see if there's anything good to eat around here... Hehe, Paimon couldn't help but notice one of the guests walk in with a huuuuge Grilled Chicken Drumstick before!
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's buy one for Shenhe, too! She can have it as a midnight snack... or save it for breakfast tomorrow!
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Alright. I will head to my room for now.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' If you need anything, don't hesitate to disturb me. I'm a light sleeper. I will hear if you knock on the door.
:{{DIcon}} Have a good rest, Shenhe.
:{{DIcon}} See you tomorrow!
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Mm-hmm. See you tomorrow.
;(Cloud Retainer lands on a nearby summit)
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, isn't that [[Cloud Retainer]]? What's she doing here?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go and say hi!
{{Dialogue end}}

{{Quest Description|update|Cloud Retainer suddenly drops by on a nearby summit. What is her purpose here?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Cloud Retainer)
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One trusts you have met Shenhe. So, are you getting along quite well?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So far so good, yeah... So you know Shenhe, too, Cloud Retainer?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Naturally. Save for [[Ganyu]], who spends the majority of her time in [[Liyue Harbor]], all the adepti living today are acquainted with Shenhe to some degree.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool! So... what's her adeptus name, anyway?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Calling her "Shenhe" feels kinda friendly, but also kinda disrespectful. So Paimon's thinking, maybe it'd be better if we called her by her adeptus name instead?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Her adeptus name? Why, pray tell, would Shenhe have an adeptus name?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... don't all adepti have a special title they go by?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' On this latter point, you are correct. However... Shenhe is human.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, oh, right... Wait, what!?
:{{DIcon}} I thought so.
::{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 12a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You knew already, (Traveler)? ...Ugh, so is Paimon the only one who didn't know?
:{{DIcon}} Never would have guessed!
::{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 12b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon neither! This is a real surprise...
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 05.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Do you mean to say that she presents differently from ordinary human beings?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... to start with, her problem-solving methods are... extremely direct.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 06.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hah... Yes, she was like this all those years ago when one first met her. In this respect, she has not changed.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 07.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One first found Shenhe by chance in a cave. One was passing by and sensed the presence of a god's remains. Being of an ever-vigilant disposition, one entered immediately to inspect the scene.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 08.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Inside was Shenhe, then aged around six years old. In her hand, she held a dagger, with which she was confronting a monster that was the god's remains incarnate.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds so dangerous...
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 09.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' When one arrived, she had already been locked in confrontation with this monster for several days. Most mortal children are fragile, both physically and mentally, and are highly reliant on their parents for survival. But not so her.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 10.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' That she was able to endure such terrible danger was due not only to her strong willpower but also to the bloodlust and homicidal instinct with which she was born.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 11.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One dealt with the monster, yet she still refused to lower her guard. She even pointed her dagger in one's direction and remained ready to strike. Only after she was satisfied that one had no intention to cause her harm did she finally relent. She then passed out without uttering a single word.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In other words, if you hadn't passed by that day, Shenhe might have...
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 12.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Not necessarily. Upon one's arrival, one could sense that the god's wrath was gradually receding. Even had the stalemate continued, one suspects that Shenhe may have still emerged the victor of the confrontation.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's still so dangerous though! Why was a tiny little kid battling against the wrath of a god in the first place!?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 13.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Alas, the mortal world is rife with suffering of every kind, and she had experienced her fair share of this even at a tender age. Seeing that she was homeless, one decided to adopt her.
:{{DIcon}} So when Shenhe talks about her "master," she means...
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 14.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Indeed, it is one to whom she refers. Shenhe has an extraordinary constitution, making her well adapted to practicing the adepti arts. All the adepti cherished her talents, and so we were willing to train her.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 15.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' However, her homicidal urges did not subside with age. Rather, they grew stronger day by day...
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 16.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' [[Moon Carver]] once performed a divination for her. He declared that "Her fate is to bear the curse of calamity. Consumed by malevolent energy, she is prone to bring harm to those around her. Such is the magnitude of the danger this poses that her soul must be bound with [[red ropes]] to keep her homicidal instinct at bay."
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 17.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The red ropes have indeed served to keep her calmer and more content, but also seem to have rendered her somewhat... inexpressive. Perhaps the red ropes are so powerful that they have suppressed some of her other emotions as well.
;(A shadow passes and disappears)
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 18.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' It is only by fate that people's paths may cross. Now that Shenhe's path has crossed with yours, please be sure to treasure the gift that fate has given you, and take good care of her.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhhh, now Paimon gets it. You came out here to check up on Shenhe because you were worried about her, didn't you?
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 19.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph! You dare draw such a facile conclusion on the nature of one's present excursion? Incorrect. The truth is that while Liyue Harbor may seem peaceful today, danger is always lurking in the shadows.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 20.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ningguang once made a bold assertion that this is to be the era of the contract between Liyue and the humans... Well. One is most curious to observe how she will respond to the coming storm.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 21.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' If she handles it admirably, one is willing to be a witness to her achievements. But if she does not... the adepti shall not hesitate to seize control.
:{{A|vo shlq002 13 cloudretainer 22.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Let us conclude our conversation here for today. One has occupied enough of your time, and night is approaching. Be sure to get ample rest.

;(After talking to Cloud Retainer)
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Shenhe isn't an adeptus after all. She just grew up around the adepti...
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder she doesn't like being treated as an adeptus. Having everyone falling over themselves to show their respect all the time must be kinda hard to deal with...

;(Talk to Cloud Retainer again)<!-- can get either one as the first talk-again dialogue; can get either one after the first talk-again dialogue -->
;(Version 1)
::{{A|vo dialog shlq002 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' A human raised by the adepti is precisely what Liyue needs right now. It is also what the adepti wish to give to Liyue.
;(Version 2)
::{{A|vo dialog shlq002 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' There seem to have been a growing number of tales told regarding Shenhe in recent years. Perhaps she was seen on the previous occasion when she secretly ventured out from the mountains.
::{{A|vo dialog shlq002 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One has heard that a playwright in Liyue Harbor wrote an opera based on the legends told about her. It is called "[[The Divine Damsel of Devastation]]."
::{{A|vo dialog shlq002 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The play portrays her as making a stand to protect her fellow villagers... Hehe, one can only surmise that every story needs a hero.
----
;(Wait until following day and approach the hotel)
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey... So, Shenhe...
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...Master has relayed my situation to you, I take it.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? How did you know?
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I'd intended to wait until you came back before going to sleep, but I didn't hear you come in.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I was worried that something may have happened to you. So I went outside to check, and caught sight of my master.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' On top of this, you have been acting very strangely around me this morning, causing me to suspect that my master must have told you everything about me.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' After all, master is... very talkative.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Sorry, Shenhe. Paimon had you down as an adeptus this whole time, but it turns out Paimon was wrong.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' It's okay. I don't mind.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' The fault is mine for not explaining everything to you sooner. Because in my experience, trying to explain is a futile pursuit.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Still, though you mistook me for an adeptus, you never treated me as distant and unapproachable. Instead, you treated me as you would a friend...
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' For this, I am very grateful indeed.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' To be fair, we've met our fair share of real adepti, too.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, now it's settled! From now on, you're our friend! Whether you're an adeptus or a human isn't the important thing &mdash; first and foremost, we're just plain old friends!
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 10.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Got it. Although I don't know quite what it entails in terms of what I have to do, I must say I like the title "friend" very much indeed.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Well, now that we're all rested up, we should start searching for the other two items on the list.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But before we do that, let's go to the building site and ask Ningguang's little helper how the progress is going.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, Sunset Vermillionite is so rare, Paimon doubts many competitors will really be able to find any. If it turns out some of them have given up already, we'll be able to take things a little more slowly.

;(After talking to Shenhe)
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! And another thing, we bought some Grilled Chicken Drumsticks on the way back last night! There was a place just outside.
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Here's one for you, Shenhe! Try it, they're so good!
:{{A|vo shlq002 14 shenhe 11.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...I concur. It has a rich flavor, far more agreeable than those I've cooked for myself in the wilderness in the past.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Rainy [[weather]] begins when the player is talking to Cloud Retainer. This rainy weather is present in [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]], and [[Inazuma]], including in areas that normally never have rainy weather such as the cities ([[City of Mondstadt]], [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Inazuma City]]), [[Watatsumi Island]], and [[Andrius]]'s arena prior to defeat.<!-- Dragonspine and most of Inazuma was not checked -->
** The rainy weather is cleared upon spawning Andrius and then ending the battle either by defeating him<!-- assumption --> or leaving the arena<!-- confirmed -->.
