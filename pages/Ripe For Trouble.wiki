{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If the player talks to Tisoc before obtaining a [[Green-Edged Paper Slip]])
:'''???:''' Hey there, you two! Now, I can see the hot blood running in your veins as you rush into yonder cave, but stop there for a minute.
:'''???:''' Your attire tell me you're not from our tribe, the Scions of the Canopy... Heh, who am I kidding? You aren't from Natlan at all, are you?
:'''Paimon:''' What's up with that? Are only people from Natlan allowed in?
:'''???:''' That goes without saying! But even then, not just anyone from our tribe can go in, let alone people from Natlan as a whole...
:'''???:''' *sigh* Well, you're pretty quick on the uptake for a flying kid with shaggy hair.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, of course, Paimon's a bright spark... Wait are you saying she doesn't look like it?
:{{DIcon}} That's certainly how you strike me, Paimon!
:'''???:''' Yeah, it's just... exactly that! You get me, don'cha, my outlander friend?
:'''Paimon:''' What are you two talking about? Are you... complimenting Paimon? Hmm, doesn't quite seem like it...
:'''Tisoc:''' You can consider it praise, of course! Anyway... Name's Tisoc, and I'm the guard here &mdash; and an excellent one, at that.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon's Paimon &mdash; as good a guide as you are a guard &mdash; and this is (Traveler)...
:{{DIcon}} Most excellent of adventurers, at your service!
::'''Tisoc:''' I see. An adventurer, huh? Makes sense. Doubt any ordinary traveler could find this spot anyway.
:{{DIcon}} Formidable Guard Slayer, at your service!
::'''Tisoc:''' Really? Are you a "Formidable Guard" Slayer, or a Formidable "Guard Slayer," in that case?
::'''Tisoc:''' Either way... *sigh* Does that mean I'm facing some sort of dangerous person right now?
::'''Paimon:''' Nah, he's just talking nonsense! And even if he were to slay any guards, they'd be "Ruin Guards"!
:'''Tisoc:''' Ah! But anyway, I can't let you in. It is, after all, where our tribe produces our Flamegranates &mdash; real important business.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, what's so special about that? You find those everywhere here in Natlan!
:'''Tisoc:''' Ah, see that's where you'd be mistaken. If you pick them using a special technique, not only will they not explode, but they'll produce honey as rich in phlogiston as Quenepa Berries!
:'''Tisoc:''' Dry the skins, and you can even get bags that our Couriers can carry. *sigh* Though you outlanders wouldn't get the beauty of something like this.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so that's what those round sacks are made from...
:'''Tisoc:''' That's right. What's more, this cave is home to awesome [[Mountain King Flamegranate]]s... Which makes me, the one who guards them, just as awesome.
:'''Tisoc:''' That said, the Mountain King Flamegranates have recently been... Eh, forget it. Whatever the case, unless you've got one of those green passes that rustle when you rub 'em, I'm not letting you through.
:'''Paimon:''' Can't we even sneak a peek?
:'''Tisoc:''' Not even that &mdash; not even people from our tribe are allowed in without a pass...
:'''Tisoc:''' And speaking of that, I heard {{Color|buzzword|someone lost theirs}} a few days back. Couldn't find it either... Man did Wayna chew them out.
:'''Tisoc:''' Oops. Seems I've said more than I should.
:'''Tisoc:''' Anyway, no entry without a pass, y'hear?

;(Talk to Tisoc again, optional)
:'''Tisoc:''' *sigh* Whatever will we do about the Mountain King Flamegranates&mdash; Wait, hey! Stop! I told you before &mdash; no passage without a pass...
:'''Tisoc:''' I mean, take {{Color|buzzword|the fella in our tribe}} who lost his pass for example. I've known him a long time, but I can't let him pass either... Rules are rules. That's all there is to it.
---- 
;(Obtain Green-Edged Paper Slip)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, what's that you just picked up? A piece of paper with a green border?

;(Approach ??? [Poca])
:'''???:''' Oh, this is bad. This is bad... Tisoc... Has something happened to him?
:'''???:''' Should I go in and take a look? Ugh, but if that guy catches me, I'm going to get another earful... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Who might you be?
:{{DIcon}} Your name, please!
:'''???:''' I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm Poca, a Courier here in the tribe. I&mdash;I'll have you know I even earned the title of Best Courier the year before last... It's the truth, you can check for yourself!
:'''Poca:''' ...Wait a minute. I'm supposed to be the one asking these questions. I mean, I'm a Scion of the Canopy, aren't I!? So, who are you then? You're not even from Natlan, are you?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, doesn't matter who you are or where you're from &mdash; the skittish types always look more suspicious...
:'''Poca:''' Yeah, so I've been told... "Chin up and chest out, Poca!" But if you ask me, back-bent and careful-on-your-feet works better for my line of work.
:'''Poca:''' A&mdash;Anyway, who are you two...

:'''You introduce yourselves to Poca...'''

:'''Poca:''' Ah, I see. So you're travelers from afar...
:'''Poca:''' *sigh* I'm likely not supposed to tell you this, but this cave is the site of the [[Mother Flamegranate Tree]]'s roots, which our tribe's always guarded.
:'''Poca:''' Special "Mountain King Flamegranates" also grow there, making this a very, very important spot.
:'''Poca:''' That's why my friend, the serious Tisoc, guards this spot. And while it's not good to speak ill of people behind their backs, I reckon he's almost too serious!
:'''Poca:''' He bars the way here everyday, and gets super mad if anyone tries to sneak past... That hasn't made him the most popular fella in our tribe.
:'''Poca:''' Heh, not that I dislike him for it... But either way, he's not here today, and I've been waiting a while... A worrying sign.
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't you go in and have a look yourself?
:'''Poca:''' No, I couldn't! You need a pass to get in &mdash; you know those green-edges slips of paper? Those are the ones! And I don't have one...
:'''Poca:''' They aren't easy to get your hands on, and strictly controlled too. I heard that someone lost one a couple of days ago, and Wayna gave them a real earful.
:'''Paimon:''' (Hmm, that's weird. She seems to be describing the item we found... Why don't we show it to her, (Traveler)?)
:{{DIcon}} Might this be the pass you're talking about...
:{{DIcon}} (Display the green piece of paper...)
:'''Poca:''' Ah, that is indeed the pass. Hmm... Ugh, you've put me in a tough spot now.
:'''Paimon:''' Tough spot... Why? We can just give it to you, and then, boom &mdash; not only do you have a pass, but you can even go in and check on your friend...
:'''Poca:''' *sigh* S'not that simple. Having one won't stop Tisoc from lecturing me...
:'''Paimon:''' And why's that?
:'''Poca:''' Well, just think, little Paimon! These passes are usually given to those who can do long-term guard duty, but I'm just a tribe Courier...
:{{DIcon}} Who runs to and fro every day...
:'''Poca:''' Exactly. So if I went in, I'd be exposed right away. In theory, anyone who sees something that belongs to the tribe should have it retrieved... But I can't use it.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so that's it. In that case, we'd have just snuck in without showing you the pass at all!
:'''Poca:''' Well, that's what makes things tough on me... How about this? I'm just going to pretend you're not here, like a Yumkasaurus with its eyes close...
:'''Poca:''' And could I trouble you to go in and have a look in my stead? Tisoc's serious, but he's not the brightest. Just say you got a pass from our chief. What do you say?
:'''Poca:''' Of course, I'll be sure to reward you. In fact, I'd be glad to help someone who helped me and even retrieved one of our passes.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, y'know, (Traveler)... If Tisoc's not hurt, we'll get paid just for having a walk down there. Nifty, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, we'll go in and have a look.
:'''Poca:''' In that case, I'll be up here under the Mother Flamegranate Tree, waiting for you, alright?
----
{{Quest Description|Time to look for Tisoc, the missing guard...}}
;(Talk to Poca again, optional)
:'''Poca:''' Why, that Tisoc, worrying me like this... But anyway, I'm quite curious as to what he's been hiding lately...

;(Approach roots)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! Someone's passed out over there. That's Tisoc, isn't it?

;(If the player previously met Tisoc)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey! Wake up! You okay?
::'''Tisoc:''' Ugh... I... H&mdash;Have I been called to the Night Kingdom already? I believe I see a floating person...
::'''Tisoc:''' Huh? Wait. Let me have a closer look at you... You're Paimon!
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! It's Paimon, most excellent Paimon!
::'''Tisoc:''' *sigh* Thank you both so much. I was coming down here to check on things, but I wound up fainting... Perhaps the abnormal environment here has caused a drastic change in temperature...
::'''Tisoc:''' N&mdash;No, wait. First off, how did you get in here without a pass?
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, we've got one. C'mon, (Traveler), show him. That'll teach him to let passes pass, but not people! 
::{{DIcon}} This is what you're looking for, I believe...
::{{DIcon}} (Display the green piece of paper...)
::'''Tisoc:''' Hmm... Yes, this is one of our passes.
::'''Tisoc:''' I didn't expect to see it in the hands of an outlander. That's quite novel... But rather strange all the same.
::'''Paimon:''' Why? Is this the wrong pass?
::'''Tisoc:''' Right pass, wrong people. In truth, the green patterns on the side of the pass have names hidden in them... and this should be the one that was lost a few days ago.
::'''Tisoc:''' ...Let me guess. You found the pass and came here. In which case, the most sensible thing to have done in my absence would have been to send this back to our tribe.
::'''Tisoc:''' But you chose to come down here instead... Did someone instruct you to, then? And since they knew about the passes, but not all the details... A Courier, then?
::'''Paimon:''' What the... You do know your stuff after all! And Poca told us you were some overly serious, stubborn, thick-headed... Err, oops.
::'''Tisoc:''' Oh, her, was it? Good. Then I know who to settle the score with once I get back up.
::'''Paimon:''' Ack, slip of the tongue... But still, she only asked us to come down here because she was concerned about you!
::'''Tisoc:''' Oh really? I'd say she did it on purpose... *sigh* Didn't she think she'd figure me out despite my efforts to hide it...
::'''Tisoc:''' Still, she did send me an outlander unrelated to tribal affairs, like delivering a pillow to someone about to doze off.
::'''Tisoc:''' Well then, brave warriors! Could you hear me out? I've a request I can't tell the rest of the tribe about. {{sic|I'd preferred|expected=I'd prefer/I'd have preferred}} to have solved this myself...
::'''Tisoc:''' But as you can see, I ended up lying on the ground here.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're just a guard. Why do you have to investigate this cave too?
::'''Tisoc:''' Actually... *sigh* It's the Mountain King Flamegranates. Here's one of them right here - the best of the best, both in terms of size and phlogiston content.
::'''Tisoc:''' It's just that they were supposed to ripen over the last two days... and yet, as you can see, they're still all green and blue. No signs of maturing at all.
::'''Tisoc:''' As their names suggest, they are to be offered to the Mountain King, and their importance needs no words to explain.
::'''Tisoc:''' Also, this isn't just about the Mountain King Flamegranates... Most of the fruit grown on the Mother Tree amidst the cliffs are also "green" as can be.
::'''Tisoc:''' I've taken care of them for so many years. How could I not tell that something had gone wrong with the roots?
::'''Paimon:''' You could've just told the others in your tribe!
::'''Tisoc:''' Pah. No one knows Flamegranate Trees better than I do, that much I can guarantee. In other words, if I can't solve the issue...
::'''Tisoc:''' ...Forget it. If I can't solve this, I'll simply admit defeat and have people from either the Masters of the Night-Wind or the Collective of Plenty take a look. But before that, I'm the only person who can handle this.
::'''Tisoc:''' It will, however, be difficult to pull off on my own, so... Well, you are brave outlander warriors, are you not?
;(If the player has not met Tisoc)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, Tisoc! Wake up! Are you alright?
::'''Tisoc:''' Ugh... I... H&mdash;Have I been called to the Night Kingdom already? I believe I see a floating person...
::'''Tisoc:''' Huh? Wait, no, these are the roots of the Flamegranate Tree... Bah, and here I thought I'd gone to the Night Kingdom already.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, you might certainly have ended up in a faraway place, had we not come down to have a look...
::'''Tisoc:''' Th&mdash;Thank you so much. I wanted to come down and check things out, but the temperature changed drastically for some reason... and I collapsed.
::'''Tisoc:''' N&mdash;No, wait, hang on. First off, how did you get in here without a pass?
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, we've got one. C'mon, (Traveler), show him. That'll teach him to let passes pass, but not people! 
::{{DIcon}} This is what you're looking for, I believe...
::{{DIcon}} (Display the green piece of paper...)
::'''Tisoc:''' Hmm... Yes, this is one of our passes.
::'''Tisoc:''' Sorry, could I get your names...

::'''You introduce yourselves to Tisoc...'''

::'''Tisoc:''' (Traveler) and Paimon, huh. I see...
::'''Tisoc:''' I didn't expect to see it in the hands of an outlander. That's quite novel... But rather strange all the same.
::'''Paimon:''' Why? Is this the wrong pass?
::'''Tisoc:''' Right pass, wrong people. In truth, the green patterns on the side of the pass have names hidden in them... and this should be the one that was lost a few days ago.

::'''Tisoc:''' That said... *sigh* This is going to be difficult to pull off on my own. So, my brave outlander warriors...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we could help you, it's just that...
:'''Tisoc:''' ...Hah. I'll bet Poca sent you down here with promises of payment or something, yes?
:'''Tisoc:''' Well, if we solve our Flamegranate Tree problem, I'll have her contribute a greater share.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, why her...
:{{DIcon}} Shouldn't it be you instead?
:'''Tisoc:''' Hey now, she's a Courier. More capable by far of paying than someone on a fixed salary like me!
:'''Tisoc:''' And anyway, she's the once who persuaded two outlanders to enter our taboo grounds, just so she could find out what's going on &mdash; there's gotta be a "cost" to that, right?
----
{{Quest Description|Explore the roots of the Mother Flamegranate Tree alongside Tisoc to find a way to get the Mountain King Flamegranates to ripen}}

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' But even if we wanted to help solve the problem, what could we even do to help?
:'''Tisoc:''' I have a hunch. Please go over there and take a look first!

;(Approach the cracked rock)
:'''Tisoc:''' Ach, as expected, this spot is completely blocked off... That said, I found what's causing the temperature change a moment ago.
:'''Tisoc:''' And as I thought, it's because there's this... solidified lava blocking the airflow.
:'''Paimon:''' So what do we do, then?
:{{DIcon}} We could negotiate with it...
::'''Paimon:''' Bold of you to think it's capable of bargaining at all! Why don't we find some other way to get it to "clear out"!?
:{{DIcon}} We could just blow it up!
::'''Paimon:''' That could work &mdash; there's certainly more than enough fruits around here to cause a great big boom.

;(Destroy the cracked rock)
:'''Paimon:''' Who'd have thought there'd be such a huge space behind this rock...
:'''Tisoc:''' Indeed. Our journey to solve the problem has only just begun...

;(Approach the cracked rocks)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, more lava blocking our way...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's find a way to blow it up!

;(Destroy the cracked rocks)
:'''Paimon:''' Talk about a chain reaction!
:'''Tisoc:''' Those lumps of congealed lava have been blown away... and the path to the bottom of the roots has opened up too. Lady luck is with us, it seems!
:'''Paimon:''' The bottom of the roots?
:'''Tisoc:''' That's right. Breaking through the rock up here is just a band-aid solution... If there's no air circulation, it will affect the temperature at which Flamegranates ripen.
:'''Tisoc:''' But as I suspected, simply opening up a passage hasn't gotten to the "root" of the problem... To do that, we'll have to go down to the bottom of the roots to take a look.

;(Enter lower level)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon knew it! No wonder Natlan's so hot, they even have underground lava...
:'''Tisoc:''' Haha, good one Paimon. Where else would all the phlogiston in the Flamegranates come from?
:'''Tisoc:''' It's precisely because of the environment that such phlogiston-packed fruit can grow in the first place.

;(Approach lava)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, this is amazing! Such thick roots &mdash; and they're not burning despite being so close to the lava!
:'''Tisoc:''' Of course. The roots of the Flamegranate Tree not only endure proximity to Liquid Phlogiston &mdash; their fibers can even absorb it and grow as a result.
:'''Tisoc:''' ...As such, being "close to lava" isn't the normal state. The roots should really be "immersed in lava."
:'''Tisoc:''' Seems like the issue's with the lava's surface... The entire root system's temperature has gone down. That's how lava that should never have cooled or piled up now blocks our way...
:'''Paimon:''' So we just need to get the {{Color|buzzword|lava level to rise}}, right?
:{{DIcon}} Well, if you could grow to prodigious size and sit in the lava, Paimon...
::'''Paimon:''' No way! That sounds super hot!
:{{DIcon}} Quick, Paimon, vomit the food you ate into the pool of...
::'''Paimon:''' That won't raise the lava one bit! It'll swallow all that food &mdash; and at that point, it might as well stay in Paimon's stomach.
:'''Paimon:''' You're talking nonsense again, aren't you, (Traveler)... Still, if we must make the lava rise...
:'''Tisoc:''' Look, over there. The issue's just that the lava outlet's been blocked.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon gets it. All we need to do is blast that lava rock away, and the lava behind will... Wait, won't we be swallowed up by the surging tide once that happens?
:'''Tisoc:''' Hmm... That's a good point, Paimon. Let's see if we can find another way...

;(Approach the solidified magma)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, there really is an endless flow of lava coming out from here... But how are we gonna smash this big thing?
:'''Paimon:''' And if we smash it open here... We'll all be swallowed up by the lava!

;(Approach the solidified magma from other side)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the back of that big rock... Let's smash it from this side!

;(Destroy the cracked rock)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh oh, the lava's rising! The roots of the Flamegranate Tree are glowing where they meet with the lava...
:'''Tisoc:''' Ah, now this should be the normal look of things... Flamegranate Trees truly are mysterious.
:'''Tisoc:''' When I followed my father around as a little lad, it was witnessing this scene that convinced me that I must take care of the trees as he did...
:{{DIcon}} Will this allow the Flamegranates to mature?
:'''Tisoc:''' That's right. Not only that, but with your help, these ones have been stocked full of absorbed phlogiston. They'll make for the best Flamegranates ever... Huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Is that an earthquake!? N&mdash;No, wait, the lava's rising! C'mon, run! To the high ground!

:'''You escape from the surging Liquid Phlogiston with great difficulty and haste...'''

:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That was way too scary! What in the world happened back there? That lava just came bubbling out from underground like sludge...
:'''Paimon:''' Good thing Paimon clung onto you, (Traveler), or you might've fallen right in!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe fly me to safety next time?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmph, don't get ahead of yourself. That'd be way too tiring!
:{{DIcon}} Thought I'd lose my legs for a moment back there!
::'''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Right! C'mon, let Paimon have a look at you... Looks like they're in one piece. There, there, don't worry...
:'''Tisoc:''' *pants* Let me catch my breath for a bit... I think blowing the rocks up might have been too much agitation for the lava.
:'''Paimon:''' Still, you sure it won't be a problem that it surged up so high? Y'know, when a withered flower sucks in too much water...
:'''Tisoc:''' Well, that's a... good point, but at the same time, the Liquid Phlogiston levels will drop slowly until it becomes stable, just as before.
:'''Tisoc:''' That said, thanks to that... Look, you two! Look at the Mountain King Flamegranates' color...
:'''Tisoc:''' Let's take a closer look shall we?
:'''Tisoc:''' Wow, such perfect coloration.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa!
:{{DIcon}} No longer is this "green"...
:{{DIcon}} But a "ripe orange"!
:'''Tisoc:''' Ah, just the sight of it's enough to make you feel warm... Perhaps we'll be able to pick them after a few more days of observation.
:'''Tisoc:''' The Mountain King's not been in the best shape in recent years. If it eats this fruit, things might take a turn for the better...
:'''Tisoc:''' Either way, I can't thank you enough. This... isn't much, but take it as a token of my gratitude.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, we'll take it gladly, then. Wait didn't you say you'd have Poca fork out the lion's share?
:'''Tisoc:''' Haha, I was kidding. What's hers is hers, and what's mine is mine. We're not so close that I could bill her for helping me out.
:'''Tisoc:''' But well, what did I say? I'm the Flamegranate expert, aren't I?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, guess you're an excellent expert, on top of being a great guard!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright then. Let's head back up and try not to faint this time!
:'''Tisoc:''' That won't happen so easily now since things have stabilized here... But anyway, the pass, please. It's an important item as far as our tribe's concerned, after all...
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, right. But what if we wanna swing by again?
:'''Tisoc:''' If you're just swinging by to have another look around&mdash;
:'''Tisoc:''' I'm just going to have to keep one eye closed, just as a Yumkasaurus might.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, that's settled, once and for all. Let's go get our reward from Poca!
:'''Paimon:''' She said she'd be waiting for us under the Mother Flamegranate Tree, right?

;(Talk to Poca, optional)
:'''Poca:''' You're back! You were gone quite a while, too. So, how did it go? Run into any problems?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we sure got a lot done down there...

:'''You tell Poca what happened down by the roots of the Flamegranate Tree.'''

:'''Poca:''' So he really pulled it off... Brilliant. Now we can tell Wayna that we won't be needing to trouble the Masters of the Night-Wind or the Collective of Plenty about this matter.
:'''Poca:''' What did I tell you? I knew he could do it.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, do you're saying that Wayna already knew there was something wrong with the Flamegranate Tree's roots?
:'''Poca:''' Of course! We're all well aware of what's been going on with the Mother Flamegranate Tree. Tisoc's the only one who'd think that no one else had noticed and go about trying to solve the problem all by himself.
:'''Poca:''' Anyway, despite being so set in his way of thinking, there's something quite endearing about his obstinacy.
:'''Poca:''' Haha, and once again, thanks to the two of you, (Traveler) and Paimon! In truth though, I'd heard your names a long time ago &mdash; after all, as couriers, staying in the loop is how we make a living!
:'''Poca:''' So I simply gave you a little nudge along the way... by leaving that pass somewhere you'd come across it.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that was you!
:'''Poca:''' Haha, indeed. Well, I'm guessing that blockhead already rewarded you, so what kind of person would I be if I gave you any less than he did? Here, take these!
:'''Poca:''' And please, with this reward, let our... past grievances be forgotten, eh?
