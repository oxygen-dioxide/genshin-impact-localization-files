{{Description|An ancient bronze compass. Its needle points towards some ever-distant shore, to a non-existent harbor.}}
'''Copper Compass''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Heart of Depth]].

==Description==
A bronze compass used by a seaman.<br>In an ever-tumultuous life of wandering,<br>It points toward the direction where its owner's heart lies.

The rough [[Skipper]] once used this compass to guide his huge ship,<br>Navigating treacherous ocean paths and conquering huge whirlpools.<br>It also guided [[Parsifal|the one]] whose deep hatred hid behind an uninhibited laugh,<br>And who, lost and despondent, sought death and burning drink...

"I believe you all sing that the thief could not avoid the gallows in the end, eh?"<br>"As long as you have a place to belong to, even ending up in the belly of a fish would be alright&mdash;"<br>"Hey now, didn't you sign a contract with this ship when you came aboard?"<br>"That memory didn't get washed down with the wine, did it?"<br>"Good, then &mdash; after all, it is time to fulfill your contract."

"Is that so? ...Well, alright. It doesn't matter anymore, anyway..."
