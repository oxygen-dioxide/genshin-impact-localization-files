|description    = A slender, amphibious fish that often appears in the deep ocean. Biologically, it is an offshoot of the unagi, and it often acts in symbiosis with larger creatures.<br />As to why they appear in [[Enkanomiya]], it may be that the [[Bathysmal Vishaps]], rays, or perhaps even the ancient Great Serpent brought them to this strange land.
