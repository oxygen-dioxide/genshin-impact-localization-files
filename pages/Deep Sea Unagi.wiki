|description    = A slender, amphibious fish that often appears in the deep ocean. Biologically, it is an offshoot of the unagi, and it often acts in symbiosis with larger creatures.<br />As to why they appear in [[Enkanomiya]], it may be that the [[Bathysmal Vishaps]], rays, or perhaps even the ancient [[Orobashi|Great Serpent]] brought them to this strange land.

{{Description|Deep Sea Unagi is an amphibious creature that often appears in the deep ocean.  As it is darker in color than the [[Adorned Unagi]] and [[Red-Finned Unagi]], it is less visible in a dim environment.  Try searching for them more carefully.|The Inazuma Diaries}}
