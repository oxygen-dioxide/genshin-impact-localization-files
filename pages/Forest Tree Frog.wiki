|description = A small frog that often appears in wetlands.<br>This animal is very common in wetland areas, and its body secretes a mysterious sticky substance that has much medicinal utility. Tree Frogs are well-suited to dwelling in rainforests.<br>It is said that some tree frogs can glide between the trees. Research indicates that the principle behind such an ability is quite similar to that of wind gliders.
