'''Erinnyes''' is an island in [[Fontaine]]. It is where the [[Opera Epiclese]], [[Fountain of Lucine]], [[Marcotte Station]], and [[Erinnyes Forest]] are located. The ruins of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] are located on the north side of the island, and exploring the [[Roots of Erinnyes|depths of Erinnyes]] is considered ill-advised by [[Neuvillette]].<ref name="Elphane">{{Ref/NPC|Elphane}}</ref><!--{{Location Intro|description=<p></p>}}--><!--

{{Description|Ever since the first diluvian period, the [[Opera Epiclese]] has stood atop the consecrated Island of Erinnyes. Overlooking the city above the waters, it symbolizes the new era's commitment to the rule of law and the pursuit of justice.<br>However, though the ideals guiding the nation have changed, some old traditions remain alive. To this day, newlyweds still toss coins into the [[Fountain of Lucine]] to wish for peaceful and happy lives.|[[Expedition]] description}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Erinnyes is an alternative spelling for the {{W|Erinyes}} from Greek mythology (also known as the Eumenides, or the Furies in English); the goddesses of vengeance and retribution against those who had committed moral or legal crimes. There were three of them, namely Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone.
** This spelling may be a reference to ''{{W|Les Érinnyes}}'', a French adaptation of the Ancient Greek ''{{W|Oresteia}}'' plays written by Aeschylus. The final play of the Oresteia trilogy — ''Eumenides'' — centers on the trial of Orestes for his matricide (of Clytemnestra) before the goddess Athena. The outcome of the trial signified a shift in the way crimes were punished in ancient Greece; from carrying out acts of vengeance, such as the Erinyes' pursuit of Orestes to avenge his mother, to the administration of justice by trial in the court.
