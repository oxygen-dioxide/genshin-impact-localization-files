==Profile==
Egeria became the god of Fontaine after Remus' death, uniting the various tribes that remained after Remuria's destruction. She established Fontaine's laws and was known by various titles, including "Noble Navigator," the "Ruler of Rivers and Seas," and the "Queen of All Waters."<ref name="THotDaFoR" /> Little is currently known about Egeria's reign, although it is believed that she knew about Fontaine's future conundrums; rumors claim that the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]] now spreading around Fontaine &mdash; that all Fontainians are born with sin, and that the waters will rise and dissolve the people of Fontaine, leaving only Focalors behind &mdash; are rooted in Egeria's last words.<ref name="When All">{{Ref/Quest|When All Return to the Waters}}</ref> In ''The Final Feast'', Egeria states: "The original sin is the fairest: Everyone sinks... Make the most of the final feast, because for the sinners, the curtain call has come," although this has not been identified as her last words.

Egeria is the alleged creator of the [[Oceanid]]s, and although this view has been challenged by later researchers,<ref name="ANHE">Interactable, Institute of Natural Philosophy: [[Institute of Natural Philosophy#Ancient Natural History Excerpts|Ancient Natural History Excerpts]]</ref> the Oceanids willingly followed Egeria and the strongest of them traveled all over Teyvat to follow Egeria's command of "connect[ing] everyone in the world."<ref name="Life Flows On II">{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref> Following Egeria's death, many of the Oceanids chose not to return to Fontaine, in part out of a refusal to recognize the new Hydro Archon Focalors,<ref name="Life Flows On II" /> and in part because Fontaine's waters suddenly grew bitter from pain and hate, and finding other sources of pure water was necessary for survival.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Idyia}}</ref> With Egeria's death, most of Fontaine's waters are no longer capable of naturally creating Oceanids.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Tainted Water-Splitting Phantasm}}</ref>

When the cataclysm struck and the Abyss' power emerged all over [[Teyvat]], Egeria was among the Archons who fought at Tunigi Hollow. After she was slain, her body transformed into the pure, primordial waters of the Amrita, from which Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm. When even the Amrita began to succumb to the Abyss, Rukkhadevata summoned [[Simurgh]], the [[Khvarena]] given to her long beforehand by the late [[Nabu Malikata]], to drink from the Amrita and burst into thousands of motes of Khvarena which would then cleanse the Abyss' defilement.<ref name="Vibrant Pinion" /> The [[Pari]], who are motes of Khvarena which have sentience, consider the Harvisptokhm their god.<ref name="Splendorous">{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref>

==Story==
=== History===
An [[Oceanid]] legend states that after the [[Hydro Dragon]] was removed from its position as the "heart" of the [[Primordial Sea]], an envoy of [[Celestia]] (possibly the [[Ruler of Life]], one of the [[Four Shades]] of the [[Heavenly Principles]]) created Egeria as the Primordial Sea's new heart. Despite the Heavenly Principles's alien origins, Egeria's substance and essence were formed entirely from material originating from Teyvat. At the time, no divine duty had been assigned to her.<ref name="Wings">{{Ref/Book|Wings of Merciful, Wrathful Waters}}</ref>

According to legend, the first Oceanid was born after Egeria shed the "first tear," which then gave birth to all other Oceanids. Egeria bestowed a task to the Oceanids "to seek an understanding of the diverse array of species and to love every creature." The Oceanids, following their master's desire to connect everyone in the world, thus dispersed across the waters of [[Teyvat]] to act as spies,<ref group="Note">The original Chinese term used in ''Life Flows On (II)'' is {{Zh|{{wt|間諜|间谍}}}}, which can be translated as either "spy" or "secret agent."</ref> the most powerful of whom was [[Rhodeia of Loch]].<ref name="Life Flows On II" /> Despite the usage of the term "spy," however, [[Endora (NPC)|Endora]] &mdash; communicating on Rhodeia's behalf &mdash; denies any ulterior motive on Egeria's part.

Some of Egeria's followers soon desired to live on the surface, having seen and envied human life. Not wanting to refuse her followers, Egeria decided to fulfill the request herself, taking water from the [[Primordial Sea]] and inserting it into the Oceanids' "blood" vessels, thus creating humanoid forms for them to walk on land. This action did not go unnoticed by [[Celestia]], who deemed it a sin and sentenced her to be sealed for her crimes, claiming that a prophecy would come to dissolve the people of Fontaine in order to wash their sins away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}}</ref>

After [[Remuria]] was destroyed by conflicts and rebellions, Celestia commanded Egeria to return from her [[Primordial Sea|primeval prison]]<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Ancient Sea's Nocturnal Musing}}</ref> to take over [[Remus]]' position and rule Fontaine.<ref name="Splendor of Tranquil Waters"/> Egeria returned to Fontaine and gathered the survivors, mediated between their feuds, and instructed them to establish new cities around flowing springs, thus commencing an era guided by law which has endured to the present day.<ref name="Remuria"/> She was awarded a [[Gnosis]],<ref name="Wings" /> ascended as the Hydro Archon, and became one of [[The Seven]].<ref name="Vibrant Pinion" />

She exiled all of the criminals from her nation, who lived in misery as they were shunned by society. Eventually, some of these criminals begged for forgiveness, which she heard through the waters. Egeria granted their wish for redemption, ordering them to guard her secret beneath the waves, which they did. This resulted in the construction of the [[Fortress of Meropide]], a living place for them, with its main purpose to stop the path leading to the [[Primordial Sea]], though this was eventually forgotten over time.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones}}</ref>

While knowing she could not make an enemy of the divine, Egeria did not want harm to befall her followers because of the prophecy. She assigned Focalors, one of her Oceanid followers, to be her successor, hoping that she would be able to concoct a plan to deceive Celestia.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref>

===The Cataclysm===
Five hundred years prior to the events of the main story, the cataclysm began. Egeria was among several gods who ventured to Tunigi Hollow to combat the forces of the [[Abyss]] spewing forth from the rift there. However, she was eventually slain during the conflict, and her body was subsequently turned into a pool of pure dew called the [[Amrita Pool|Amrita]].<ref name="Vibrant Pinion" />

As Egeria had been stained by corruption and unable to be reborn in a purer plane, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the Harvisptokhm from the Amrita, allowing Egeria's consciousness to remain anchored to the mortal realm by dwelling within the Gaokerena, a giant lotus within the Harvisptokhm.<ref name="Hymm 1">{{Ref/Quest|The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 1)}}</ref> The power of the Harvisptokhm would maintain the seal and absorb the defilement at Tunigi Hollow, keeping the Abyss at bay for years to come while the Amrita nourished the [[Vourukasha Oasis]] around the Harvisptokhm.<ref name="Splendorous" />

Eventually, as the corruption of the defilement began taking its toll on the Harvisptokhm, a [[Khvarena]] bird named [[Simurgh]] was forced to make her destined sacrifice by drinking the water of the Amrita and transmuting herself into limitless Khvarena lifeforms. This resulted in the creation of the sentient [[Pari]] and other Khvarena forms, who began to defend and worship the Harvisptokhm as their god.<ref name="Splendorous" />

===Legacy===
Following Egeria's passing, she was succeeded as Hydro Archon by Focalors. However, the Oceanids, who worshipped Egeria and refused to recognize Focalors as the new Hydro Archon, ventured to the Harvisptokhm in search of their master.<ref name="Pale Fire"/> Upon discovering what remained of their former god, the Oceanids spread across Teyvat to continue their former god's wish in exile.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Rhodeia of Loch}}</ref> Since then, many of the Oceanids have cut all ties with Fontaine.<ref name="Life Flows On II" />

Over 400 years ago, [[Rene de Petrichor]], [[Jakob]], and [[Karl Ingold]] traveled to the Girdle of the Sands in hopes of finding a way to avert Fontaine's impending water crisis. There, Rene discovered that his and Jakob's physical constitutions were similar to the Gaokerena's, but Karl's was not.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Rene's Investigation Notes}}</ref>

===Present Day===
Centuries later, massive defilement build-up &mdash; which was not ritually cleansed by the [[Order of Skeptics]], who had lost their connection to the Pari &mdash; caused [[the Sign of Apaosha]] to form over the Harvisptokhm, threatening to erode it. During the {{Quest|Khvarena of Good and Evil}}, the Pari [[Sorush]] teams up with the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] to purify the defilement and awaken Egeria's consciousness.<ref name="Splendorous" /> With help from [[Mihir]] and [[Rashnu]], the trio perform the Rite of Chinvat at Tunigi Hollow to gain access into the Harvisptokhm.<ref name="Hymm 1" />
[[File:Gaokerena.png|300px|thumb|The Gaokerena, a lotus flower in which Egeria's consciousness was anchored by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]].]]

Inside the tree, the trio traverse through various Defiled Chambers within Egeria's consciousness to extract several Spenta Hearts within them. With the hearts, the trio perform the Rite of Ab-Zohr to bloom the Flower of Sanctity within the Gaokerena and awaken Egeria's consciousness, which then unleashes Amrita across the land to rid it of its defilement, extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha and allowing the withered Harvisptokhm to regrow.<ref name="Hymm 2">{{Ref/Quest|The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)}}</ref>

When the Traveler and Paimon arrive in Fontaine, they learn that a prophecy has recently been circulating around Fontaine: That all people from Fontaine are born with sin that cannot be absolved; one day, the waters of Fontaine will rise and the sinful people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne &mdash; only then will the sins of the people be washed away. [[Neuvillette]] speculates that it is rooted in Egeria's last words before her death, believing that it is the "conundrum" she left behind for her successor.<ref name="When All" />
