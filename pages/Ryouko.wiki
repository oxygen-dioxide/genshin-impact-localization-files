==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ryouko:''' Hehe, welcome. Care to have some specialty snacks?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Sure, I'll have some. <small>''(Only after completing [[Chisato's Letter]])''</small>
::'''Ryouko:''' Wonderful. Here is the menu.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Ryouko/Supper Gossip|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Ryouko:''' Ha ha, it seems that you need to reconsider your deck composition...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Ryouko:''' I had no idea you were so good at cards. You must be exhausted from all that strategizing. Do you want to buy something to eat?
:{{DIcon}} So, what's with this store?
::'''Ryouko:''' This food stall.. was founded by my husband, who asked me to join him.
::'''Ryouko:''' I didn't really want to work in this line of business at first. You have to wake up early and go home late. My husband was never in good health either... How could he have handled this for long?
::'''Ryouko:''' But he told me that he loved seeing the smile on people's faces while they were eating the snacks I made... In the end, I could not dissuade him.
::{{DIcon}} Your husband?
:::'''Ryouko:''' We promised each other that we'd buy a shop in [[Hanamizaka]] when we made enough money so that more people would be able to try our snacks.
:::'''Ryouko:''' ...But during the autumn two years ago, he didn't listen to me and insisted in purchasing goods in pouring rain. In the end...
:::'''Ryouko:''' Now, the best way for me to remember him is to run this stall well and cherish our memories together.
:::'''Ryouko:''' If you would visit more often, dear customer, that would certainly help him rest in peace...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You must be very good at cooking?
:::'''Ryouko:''' Hehe, this client has a way with words. Even though I'm not famous, I'm confident in my abilities when it comes to the seasoning of Inazuma snacks.
:::'''Ryouko:''' Here, I've cooked a fresh batch. Would you like to try some they are still hot?<!--sic-->
:::'''Ryouko:''' It seems like you're an outlander. If the food isn't to your tastes, I can specially adjust the seasoning just for you.
::;(Obtain [[Dry-Braised Salted Fish]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ryouko:''' Take care. I look forward to your next visit.
