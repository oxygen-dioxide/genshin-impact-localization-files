{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yizheng:''' Come on! Just need to persevere. I'll get used to working on the ship soon!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Yizheng:''' Greetings! I'm Yizheng, one of the workers here at the dock. I'm in charge of short-distance transport of small items between Qingce Village and Chenyu Vale.
::'''Yizheng:''' As you can see, Wangshu Inn is just up ahead. That's where this route ends.
::'''Yizheng:''' But I haven't been able to visit it via boat because I get seasick easily.
::'''Yizheng:''' I've heard the food there is really good, though.
::{{DIcon}} Can you still be a boatman if you get seasick?
::'''Yizheng:''' Well, I love the feeling of sailing on water, so there's that...
::'''Yizheng:''' I've been fascinated with the ocean since I was young. I could watch large ships in the harbor for hours on end every day.
::'''Yizheng:''' The old men who worked at the dock said that it took many sailors a while to get used to the waves and the wind on the ocean.
::'''Yizheng:''' I got this job as soon as I came of age so I could get a head start.
::'''Yizheng:''' And before I knew it, I'd been at this for many years.
::{{DIcon}} Where's this giant ship?
::'''Yizheng:''' It's really easy to get stranded in the rivers here, so it's no place for large ships. You'll see them in Yilong Wharf and Liyue Harbor, though.
::'''Yizheng:''' The giant ships with metal frames fear no storms and can sail right into huge waves. Exciting, don't you think?
::'''Yizheng:''' I would have been on one of those and traveling the world right now if it weren't for my seasickness.
:{{DIcon}} What's so amusing?
::'''Yizheng:''' Work! Work keeps me motivated!
::'''Yizheng:''' Just think about it... If I work hard and improve, I'll overcome my seasickness eventually.
::'''Yizheng:''' Then I can board a giant ship and become a sailor on long journeys.
::'''Yizheng:''' That's my ultimate goal as a dock worker!
:{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::'''Yizheng:''' Thank you, youngster. I hope you'll get to experience the charm of giant ships one day.
