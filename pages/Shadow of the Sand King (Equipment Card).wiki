==Trivia==
*There are two main possibilities of who the card depicts. One possibility is that this depicts a priest of [[King Deshret]] as the headpiece was made in imitation to the one worn by him. The other possibility is that this is King Deshret himself as he may have worn this similar headpiece. Moreover, the Artifact Set [[Gilded Dreams]] is attributed to him.
