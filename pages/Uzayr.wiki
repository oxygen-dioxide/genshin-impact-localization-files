'''Uzayr''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in {{Quest|Treasure and True Interest}}.

==Profile==
Uzayr was a student at [[Alkami]]'s training center and one of the 20 students assigned to Kaveh's class. Like [[Tanisha]] and [[Waiz]], he was falsely sold the dream of striking it rich as an architect, but unlike those two, his reason for wanting to become wealthy isn't stated. 

Being from a poor family, his parents couldn't afford the exorbitant tuition fees to put him through Alkami's classes and were instructed to take out a loan from the loanshark [[Fakhr]], which Uzayr claims that they are still paying off. Using this information, Kaveh and the [[Traveler]] confront Fakhr and expose Alkami's schemes to the [[Matra]], resulting in the closure of Alkami's training center.

After Alkami's training center is closed down for investigation, he, [[Tanisha]], and a new boy named [[Shurayh]] return to the location of Alkami's classes to discuss the situation, expressing disappointment that Alkami was a scammer. Uzayr explains to his friends that Kaveh could always become their instructor, recalling how Kaveh promised to take him under his wing if anything happened the day before, with Shurayh skeptical that Kaveh would return.

At the end of the route, he becomes one of Kaveh's students.
