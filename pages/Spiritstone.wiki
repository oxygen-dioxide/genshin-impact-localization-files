{{Location Intro|The '''Spiritstone'''<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?}}</ref>|description=<p>{{If Self|Spiritstone|It|The Spiritstone}} is a [[Celestial Nail]] located in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. A fragment known as the '''Wishstone''' was discovered in [[Stony Halls]], and the effect it had on the miners who came in contact with it prompted the [[Liyue Qixing]] to close off The Chasm entirely. Chunks of ore that seem to be related to this mysterious large crystal were also found.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Find The Chasm Mining Records}}</ref></p>}}

==Overview==
Little information is given about the Spiritstone or the ancient civilization whose ruins line the depths of The Chasm. Given that it is a Celestial Nail, it can be presumed that it was cast down by the [[Heavenly Principles]] after the war against the [[Second Who Came]], both to heal the land and suppress the "dark poison" &mdash; suggested to be [[Forbidden Knowledge]] from the [[Abyss]] &mdash; that had penetrated the earth.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Homecoming}}</ref>

In the {{Quest|Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?}}, the [[Traveler]] purifies the large crystal, which summon the [[Ruin Serpent]] Haftvad the Worm from the depths. Later into the fight, [[Yelan]] shoots the nail to drop it to the ground to destroy the creature, impacting the platform below and changing the nail's elevation.

During ''[[Perilous Trail]]'', a group consisting of the Traveler, [[Paimon]], [[Arataki Itto]], [[Kuki Shinobu]], [[Yanfei]], and Yelan fall into the space underneath the Spiritstone. There, they discovered that the domain it was connected to had a mysterious property which completely annihilated the power of the Abyss, but also doomed the [[Millelith]] soldiers and the [[Yaksha]] [[Bosacius]] who had willingly sealed themselves in there to destroy the Abyssal threat during the [[cataclysm]].

It cannot be from this continent &mdash; only the heavens, with which it shares its shade, could have been its home."<br>"I have decided to explore deeper within through secret paths to uncover its secrets... I wonder how far I can press on, and what further records I shall leave behind..."|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/The Court of Pillars|The Court of Pillars]]}}
