'''Sorush''' is a [[Gadget]] that can be used for exploration in the [[Girdle of the Sands]], [[Sumeru]]. It is obtained during the World Quest ''[[The Splendorous Sky That Day]]''.

Sorush is not a true gadget and is merely toggled on when equipped, thus regular gadgets can still be used as per normal. It will also temporarily disappear while in combat or underwater. Outside of the Girdle of the Sands, it is just a cosmetic item (the player cannot play as Sorush).

Upon starting ''[[As the Khvarena's Light Shows]]'' the gadget is removed and replaced with the second version, mechanically identical but now featuring her wearing the Twin-Horned Chaplet.

==Usage==
Sorush has her own health bar. She can be damaged by [[Burning|fire]] in the environment, but [[Enemy|Enemies]] will not attack her (or even notice her). Conversely, Sorush cannot deal damage to Enemies. While playing as Sorush, most menus are still accessible, but [[Party|Party Setup]] is not. [[Character|Player Character]] is marked on the map while in Sorush mode.

==Trivia==
* Sorush's Accelerate skill consumes [[Stamina]] at a slower rate than a Player Character's [[Sprint]].
* [[NPC]]s turn their heads to follow Sorush, but will not interact.
* Sorush's Interact skill can affect nearby objects:
** Certain Enemies will stop their idle animations
*** [[Treasure Hoarders/Enemy Group|Treasure Hoarders]] that are sitting or lying down get up and walk around
*** Dancing [[Hilichurls]] stop dancing
*** [[Eremite Floral Ring-Dancer]] stops swinging
** Destroys fragile objects, i.e., cuts down shrubbery but cannot break wooden boxes
** Startles [[Wildlife]] (will not notice her until she uses her skill)
** Alerts [[Fatui Skirmisher]]s (will show "!"), though they will not attack. Curiously, no other Enemy type in the Girdle of the Sands reacts this way.
* The achievements ''[[When the Red Scarf Transforms Into a Bird in Flight...]]'', ''[[Soaring in the Skies of Sary-Ozek]]'', and ''[[Whose Descendant Are You, and What's Your Name?]]'' may be references to the novel ''{{w|The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years}}''. Set in Sary-Ozek, it features a plotline where a mother tries to remind her brainwashed, enslaved son of his heritage, but is ultimately killed by him. Her white headscarf then turns into a white bird, which forever soars the skies of Sary-Ozek, echoing her words.

=== Etymology===
*{{lang|''{{w|Sraosha}}''|ae=ê¨Øê¨≠ê¨Äê¨äê¨¥ê¨Ä}} is the Zoroastrian yazata of "Conscience" and "Observance", which is also the literal meaning of her name. It appears as {{lang|''Sorush''|fa=ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿàÿ¥|fa_rm=Sor≈´sh}} in New Persian.
