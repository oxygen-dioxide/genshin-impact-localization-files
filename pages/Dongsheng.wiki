==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Dongsheng:''' Welcome, welcome to the Second Life. What would you like to buy?
:{{DIcon|GeneralGoods}} This and that.
::'''Dongsheng:''' Over here please. Pick at your leisure.
:;(Opens [[Second Life]] wares)
:{{DIcon}} What's this place?
::'''Dongsheng:''' We're just a small store that sells everyday goods. The name's a little special, I know. I wanted to... commemorate something that happened in the past.
::'''Dongsheng:''' Would you care to hear how this store got its name?
::{{DIcon}} Well, let's hear it.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' I used to be an adventurer who visited every corner of the world.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' But the good times couldn't last. I got into an accident in Dihua Marsh, and was seriously injured.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' Fortunately, a [[Xiao|masked adeptus]] came to my rescue, and I was barely able to escape with my life.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' From that day on, I never ventured out again. This life was given to me by that adeptus. I can't just throw it away that easily.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' An ancient adage of Liyue says that "a withered tree lives again," referring to life being given anew &mdash; which fits my experience exactly.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' That's why I adapted the last part of that saying and made it the name of my shop, to commemorate that event.
::{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, but I have matters to attend to.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' It's alright, it's best not to raise old matters.
:::'''Dongsheng:''' A simple life is best, after all...
:{{DIcon}} No, thanks. See you.
::'''Dongsheng:''' Alright. Do come again, dear guest.
