==Event Dialogue==
===Divine Ingenuity===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Honglang:''' This Domain... What secrets lie inside it...
:{{DIcon}} What can you tell me about this Domain's initial appearance?
::'''Honglang:''' Um, honestly, we can't be sure ourselves.
::'''Paimon:''' Didn't you say that this place was this big, gloomy, empty room?
::'''Honglang:''' Well, that was... also something that the team of adventurers "desired," you see.
::'''Honglang:''' When entering this Domain, each of them only had one thought in mind...
::'''Honglang:''' "How I wish this place was a space heretofore unexplored by anyone."
::'''Honglang:''' And so this Domain responded to their desires, turning into something most strange.
::'''Honglang:''' So as to what this Domain might have originally been like... I suspect that it might have been "nothing at all."
:{{DIcon}} Is it safe to adventure in here?
::'''Honglang:''' As long as you do as I instructed, I'm confident that nothing will go wrong.
::'''Honglang:''' Still, I suggest that you not come into this with any particularly large wishes, just to avoid... you know, any unforeseen results.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Honglang:''' Yes, see you. Do be careful while operating this Domain, now.
