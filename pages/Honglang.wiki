==Dialogue==
===Divine Ingenuity===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Honglang:''' This Domain... What secrets lie inside it...
:{{DIcon}} What can you tell me about this Domain's initial appearance?
::'''Honglang:''' Um, honestly, we can't be sure ourselves.
::'''Paimon:''' Didn't you say that this place was this big, gloomy, empty room?
::'''Honglang:''' Well, that was... also something that the team of adventurers "desired," you see.
::'''Honglang:''' When entering this Domain, each of them only had one thought in mind...
::'''Honglang:''' "How I wish this place was a space heretofore unexplored by anyone."
::'''Honglang:''' And so this Domain responded to their desires, turning into something most strange.
::'''Honglang:''' So as to what this Domain might have originally been like... I suspect that it might have been "nothing at all."
:{{DIcon}} Is it safe to adventure in here?
::'''Honglang:''' As long as you do as I instructed, I'm confident that nothing will go wrong.
::'''Honglang:''' Still, I suggest that you not come into this with any particularly large wishes, just to avoid... you know, any unforeseen results.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Honglang:''' Yes, see you. Do be careful while operating this Domain, now.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Wind Chaser===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Honglang:''' Every time there's trouble, they send me to fix it...
:{{DIcon}} About this Domain...
::'''Honglang:''' There are a bunch of randomly distributed wind currents in this Domain. Some of them even collide with each other, forming a zone impassable via flight.
::'''Honglang:''' It's also pretty much impossible to force your way through these wind currents using a wind glider.
::'''Honglang:''' However, we have also discovered some mechanisms in this Domain. Activating them seems to affect some wind currents...
::'''Honglang:''' We think that if we can make smart use of these mechanisms, it should make exploring this Domain a heck of a lot easier...
::'''Honglang:''' However, there's also a bunch of monsters from who-knows-where skulking around in this Domain...
::'''Honglang:''' So please, take extra care while exploring this Domain, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} About yourself...
::'''Honglang:''' Me? I'm just a regular old adventurer, until Lan put me in charge of exploring unknown Domains of this type... *sigh*
::'''Honglang:''' She said something about trusting my abilities and believing that I would do great things.
::'''Honglang:''' But I think she just wanted to find someone who was free to take charge of this thankless task... It could have been anyone!
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Honglang:''' I'll leave exploring this Domain to you while I get your payment ready.
::'''Honglang:''' Be careful while you explore!
