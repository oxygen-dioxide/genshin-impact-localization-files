[[Version 4.4]]
* Fixes a bug where when the Character Card "Alhaitham" had the Status "Chisel-Light Mirror" attached, the text description for the character's Normal Attack abnormally would not state that DMG inflicted would be Dendro DMG (this was purely a textual error as the actual effect was working properly).

[[Version 4.3]]
