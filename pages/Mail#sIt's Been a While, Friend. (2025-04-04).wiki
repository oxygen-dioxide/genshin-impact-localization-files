|text      = I have to say, the commissions from the [[Adventurers' Guild]] aren't quite scratching the itch anymore. I still get to hunt monsters sometimes, but... How should I put this? I'm hungry for a bigger adventure.

That's why I came to [[Natlan]].

[[Natlan/Culture#Tribes_of_Natlan|Tribes]], hunting, monsters, [[Saurian|saurians]], and a wild, untamed land full of secrets just waiting to be discovered - it's everything I ever dreamed of!

I'm very fond of the "[[Scions of the Canopy|Huitztlan]]" tribe in particular, and I've asked them to teach me some of their climbing tricks. You should come catch me in action, swinging my way across the cliffs.

Oh, I've also included some trophies from my travels. I hope you'll find a use for them.

As always, give me a call if you run into any trouble. I'll come to help any time.
