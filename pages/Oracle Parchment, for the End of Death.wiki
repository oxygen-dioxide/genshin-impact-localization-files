==Gameplay Notes==
* The [[Strange Parchment]] is the base version of the parchment, but it is a missable item only obtained by completing the {{Quest|Royinjan's Chapter: Linga}} before completing any part of Step 1, which yields the [[Unsealed Parchment]] first and makes the Strange Parchment unobtainable.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/bTp-1gfbkxs?t=2860 Royinjan's Chapter: Linga]</ref>
* The map is identical across all parchment versions, depicting the spots for all the challenges in it, and indicating the solution to the final challenge with the arrows.
* Completing this Hidden Exploration Objective awards the {{Achievement|Call of the Nameless City}}.

==Lore==
Each time a challenge is completed, the parchment will be replaced by the next version, expanding the text on the item description.
{{Dialogue Start}}
# [[Strange Parchment]]
#: Hapless traveler, what brings you to this deep underground cave?
#: Did the legendary tales of [[Hasad|Hasad the Golden Adventurer]] entice you so?
#: Know that the tales told the world over are but a speck of sand compared to what I have experienced.
#: Only the [[King Deshret|nameless god of the desert]] knows what terrible misfortune has befallen me.
#: Those ancient secrets unbeknownst to anyone,
#: They have laid layer upon layer of curses on me,
#: And I have become the oracle of a creature invisible.
#: &nbsp;
#: Three challenges I have set forth, by order of the evil spirit watching me from the shadows.
#: Within them I hide treasures brought forth from the cursed city of brass.
#: If fear shall not stay your greed and curiosity,
#: Then follow my path.
#
# [[Unsealed Parchment]]
#: Beside the deep tunnel that leads to the pit of filth where countless Dev once dwelt,
#: The wails and screams of death echo across the ruins.
#
# [[Guiding Parchment]]
#: When the flames are lit in the correct order,
#: In the same way you came here,
#: I shall be free from this endless curse.
#
# [[Whispering Parchment]]
#: But those eternal beings can never perish,
#: Until death has become the end of death.
#
# [[Mysterious Parchment]]
#: Deep in the desert of eternal desolation, there are things even older than the ancient pyramids.
#: Those are the sinister whispers of the spirits of al-Azif, each one of them repeating that accursed name:
#: [[Shiruyeh]].
{{Dialogue End}}

The parchment reveals the fate of [[Royinjan]]'s grandfather, Hasad,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: First Chapter}}</ref> who went missing during one of his expeditions.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: Royinjan's Chapter}}</ref> Royinjan never learns about his grandfather's fate, even after this Hidden Exploration Objective is completed.

==Trivia== 
* The text on the parchment item icon translates to "That is not dead which can eternally lie, and with strange aeons even death may die."<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/xbxn8l/i_translated_the_strange_parchment_so_you_dont/ Strange Parchment Translation]</ref> This is from a couplet by {{w|H.P. Lovecraft}} that he attributed to the fictional "mad poet" Abdul Alhazred in ''{{w|The Nameless City}}'' short story.<ref>Wikipedia: {{w|Necronomicon#Appearance and contents|Necronomicon}}</ref>
* ''Al Azif'' is a title H.P. Lovecraft attributed to the ''{{w|Necronomicon}}''.
* The particle collection challenge labels the particles as [[Anemo]], but are instead [[Dendro]].
