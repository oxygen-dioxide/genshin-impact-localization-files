|desc_basic      = Fatty and lean chunks of meat are mixed with crunchy bamboo shoots before being kneaded into a ball, fried, and then boiled. The finished dish is very popular, finding a place at home meals or banquets alike.
|desc_delicious  = Emerald green onions and the ruby red meatball complement each other perfectly, while exquisite and extraordinary knife skills make for a melt-in-your-mouth meatball, fatty but not greasy, guaranteed to have you praising it all week. Don't forget to clean your plate for good luck!
