==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Livre:''' Hello, welcome to Leschots's clockwork workshop. Are you here to make a purchase? We have all sorts of interesting toys here!
:{{DIcon}} Clockwork goods?
::'''Livre:''' Indeed. We specialize in machines that function via those principles.
::'''Livre:''' Toy birds, puppets, we have it all.
::'''Livre:''' Each of them is a high-quality, fresh design. Well... though the puppet's dialogue might get bothersome after a while.
::'''Livre:''' If you're interested, we also have clockwork horses that run, clockwork [[Blubberbeast]]s that blow trumpets, and penguins that can waddle and shake in place.
::{{DIcon}} You've got penguins here in Fontaine?
::'''Livre:''' Uh... Sorry, I wasn't being very precise.
::'''Livre:''' Usually, penguins live in the cold north, but I've also heard that some of them will appear in places with a warmer climate.
::'''Livre:''' The penguins in our store weren't made by me &mdash; they're consignments made by a young lad named [[Freminet]].
::'''Livre:''' He's very good, if I do say so myself &mdash; reminds me of my younger brother, in fact.
::'''Livre:''' I once thought of inviting him to develop clockwork toys, but he remained silent, and I didn't really want to force the issue.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Livre:''' Stop by for some fun if you've got the time.
