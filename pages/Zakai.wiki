==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zakai:''' Why do people in Sumeru love to haggle so much? I'm from Sumeru too, but I don't have this awful trait.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Zakai:''' I'm a fisherman and a fresh fish wholesaler. I mainly supply seafood to restaurants in Sumeru City.
::'''Zakai:''' I also provide research materials for several researchers of [[Amurta]].
::'''Zakai:''' My buyers are all long-time clients, and our cooperation has always gone smoothly. It's just that I have to dig in my heels whenever it comes to the price of replenishing their stock...
::'''Zakai:''' I keep thinking to myself, why should larger quantities be cheaper? Are my crates of fish not all of the same quality?
::'''Zakai:''' If I started giving out discounts all willy-nilly, won't my buyers worry that there may be problems with my products?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Zakai:''' See you.
