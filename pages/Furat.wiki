==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Furat:''' The environment here is so nice that even I feel like staying and attending classes.
:{{DIcon}} Studying is a good thing.
::'''Furat:''' Hmm... In my opinion, it's half-and-half.
::'''Furat:''' If you are good at studying, you don't have to worry about making a living; but if you are too good, I hear there's a risk of going mad?
::'''Furat:''' So, it's best for an ordinary person like me to just look for a job that suits me.
::'''Furat:''' Oh right, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm a supplier, and I mainly provide Pardis Dhyai with basic supplies.
::'''Furat:''' You can contact me too, if you need any daily necessities.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'll keep that in mind.
:::'''Furat:''' Good! Looking forward to hearing from you then.
:::'''Furat:''' If not for the business, we can still shake hands for becoming friends. Please accept this as a gift from me. I'm sure it'll be useful someday.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Nagadus Emerald Fragment}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Furat:''' Bye!
