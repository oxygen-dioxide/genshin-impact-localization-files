==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nappa:''' It seems like [[Tatankasaur]]s are capable of dreaming... Do you think they dream of flying in the sky?
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Nappa:''' Oh, hello! Are you here to see the Tatankasaurs too? They're so cute!
::'''Nappa:''' They may not be able to fly, but they're much gentler than [[saurians]] who can. And don't be fooled by how they're always sleeping. They're a diligent lot, even in their dreams!
::'''Nappa:''' In the past, when [[Nanaxa]] was sleeping, its legs would move like it was chasing something. Hehe, doesn't that sound like a dream of diligence?
::{{DIcon}} What do they dream of?
:::'''Nappa:''' Maybe they dream of becoming giant volcano dragons and soaring among the clouds...
:::'''Nappa:''' Or, maybe they dream of a mountain of cabbages! Tatankasaurs are very fond of cabbages!
:::'''Nappa:''' Hehe, but honestly, I have no idea. I just think it's fun to imagine.
::{{DIcon}} Aren't Tatankasaurs supposed to be fierce?
:::'''Nappa:''' Not in the slightest! Unless someone wicked tries to hurt one on purpose, Tatankasaurs very rarely lose their temper.
:::'''Nappa:''' And even when they do get angry, they never hurt people. The most one will do is butt you lightly with its head... Despite the fact they're strong enough to crack rock.
:::'''Nappa:''' The point is, Tatankasaurs are really just gentle babies.
:{{DIcon}} Are you the caretaker here?
::'''Nappa:''' Huh? Caretaker? Ah, people sometimes call me that, but it's not like anyone bothered to consult me about making me a caretaker...
::'''Nappa:''' Maybe they did that because I come here every day to see the Tatankasaurs. I'd keep them company while Dad was keeping watch over the volcano.
::'''Nappa:''' I don't need to do anything for them, I just sit by their sides while they stare off into space. It makes them happy. I'm quite the fan of zoning out myself, to be honest, so it's a win-win situation.
::'''Nappa:''' But that kid [[Cipitz]] often comes to play-fight with the baby Tatankasaurs... It's very distracting and makes zoning out quite hard...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nappa:''' Alright, see you. Drop by again if you have the chance &mdash; Tatankasaurs really enjoy having company.
