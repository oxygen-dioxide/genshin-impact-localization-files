}}'''Preinstallation''' is a function in Genshin Impact that downloads an upcoming major update's resources to the player's device before that actual version is released. It is made available a few days prior to release.

Preinstalling depends on the player's device.

==On PC==
On PC, the preinstall button will appear next to the "Launch" button a few days prior to release. To preinstall the game, the player simply selects "Get now". Preinstallation takes some time and reduces the time spent during updates. Once all the resources are preinstalled, the text "Get now" will turn into "Installed".

==On Play Store/App Store/Epic Games Store==
On these platforms, preinstallation can be initiated by going to the store and selecting "Update" next to Genshin Impact. The player will be able to continue playing Genshin Impact while it is updating; although the app will close once the installation commences. Sometimes, preinstallation needs to be started again by going into the game and selecting the preinstall option.
