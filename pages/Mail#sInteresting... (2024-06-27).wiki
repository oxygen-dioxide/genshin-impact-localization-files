|text      = Little one, I haven't seen much of you around the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|shrine]] lately. Let me guess... Ah, your travels must have been smooth-sailing, and you made many new friends, so much so that you feel you no longer need my blessings?

Hmm, if that's indeed the case, then my birthday celebration has to be exceptionally entertaining, one so memorable that you'll never forget it. That's why this year, I'm planning to have [[Yae Publishing House]] hold a ramen eating contest together with [[Kiminami Restaurant]].

Quite a few promising contenders have already signed up, hehe.

Of course, the rewards are bound to be generous. Win the first round, and you'll receive a signed copy of Yae Publishing House's best-selling light novel. On top of that make it to the semifinals, and you'll be awarded a ramen voucher, with which you get to enjoy six months of free ramen at Kiminami Restaurant.

As for the grand prize... well, let's just say it's a little something that I've personally prepared, hehe...

Little one, I'm sure you and Paimon wouldn't miss such a delightful opportunity for the world, would you?
