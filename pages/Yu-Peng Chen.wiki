==Early Life and Education==
<blockquote>There is no doubt that my vision for the future actually manifested when I was young. I remember taking a {{w|Solfège|solfeggio}} class at that time—I was still in art school at the time—the teacher asked what you want to do. That's when I volunteered to stand up and said that I wanted to be a first-class Chinese composer. I remember that I was in art school—just a teenager at the time—and I already had such an ambition. This should be my pursuit for the future. I have to be the best. I want to be the most famous composer in China.<br /><br />{{zh|毫无疑问我对未来的憧憬。其实在我小时候就体现出来。我记得那个时候上视唱练耳课，还是在艺校的时候，老师就问大家想做什么。那个时候我就自告奋勇站起来。我要做中国第一流的作曲家。我记得那是我在艺校 十几岁的时候，我就已经有这样的一个抱负了。这应该是我对未来的一个追求。我一定要做到最好。我要做中国最有名的作曲家。}}<br /><br />&mdash; {{zh|不急}}TV interview, ''Chen Zhiyi: Music That Truly Has a Soul, Will Be Ingrained Deep Into Your Bones''<!--陈致逸|真正有灵魂的音乐,会深深烙在你的骨子里--><ref>{{zh|带你一起看落日}} (November 6, 2019).

The first film score Chen independently produced was for ''Bump in the Road'', a 2013 comedy film directed by {{w|Raymond Yip}} ({{zh|葉偉民}})<!--Yè Wěimín-->.<ref name="ArtsBangMusicalDream"/> The film's story tells of a man named Kai Zhang<!--章开--> who suddenly receives an ultrasound image of his child; he embarks on a road trip with his younger brother Xin<!--心--> to search for the child's mother.

In 2014, Chen returned to score Raymond Yip's ''{{w|The House That Never Dies}}'', a thriller film based on the haunted house {{w|Chaonei No. 81}}. Director Yip gave great importance to the music and did not give restrictions on producing the soundtrack. It was a challenge for Chen as he had no reference for the music, so he created the style, structure, tempo, and orchestration himself.

Its music production was the first test of Chen's creative techniques in the genre of horror music and influenced his work on ''The House That Never Dies''. The film is divided into three acts, each having a unique musical style. The first story is "Japanese-style creepy," the second is "American-style brutal," and the third is "heartwarming with emotions."<ref name="2016GuaitanWeixin">{{zh|陈致逸原创音乐}} (March 22, 2016).

The next film directed by Raymond Yip was ''{{w|Phantom of the Theatre}}'' in 2016, a thriller like his two previous works. The story tells of a haunted theater filled with the spirits of a performance troupe that perished in a fire many years prior. What Chen found to be most time-consuming in producing the music was not the rigorous score and complex engineering but making the score rich while not complicated, concise and not monotonous.<ref>{{zh|陈致逸原创音乐}} (May 19, 2016).

In April 2016, Chen was invited to produce the score for ''Butterfly Cemetery''. A film based on a novel of the same name by Jun Cai ({{zh|蔡骏}})<!--Cài Jùn--> and directed by Weihao Ma ({{zh|马伟豪}})<!--Mǎ Wěiháo-->, it tells of a woman named Xiaodi Shang<!--尚小碟--> who meets a half-butterfly man during a trip to Budapest. Compared to his previous film works, Chen chose a more modern style for the music, and the techniques he employed were influenced by German composer {{w|Hans Zimmer}}'s minimalist style. Since the story is set in Hungary, Chen incorporated Hungarian elements into the music. The music production went on for five months, and the film was released in October 2017.<ref>{{zh|陈致逸原创音乐}} (October 20, 2017). [https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nGEW_1dUsoWT1Y_ZpJvmEg "{{zh|音乐纪实 蝴蝶公墓}}"].

===''Magic Town''===
In 2015, Motion Magic<!--official English name--> ({{zh|幻维数码}}) invited Chen to compose songs for ''Magic Town'', an educational program for children. Most of the creative team were first-time parents or had young children, including Chen, whose partner was expecting their daughter. As Chen was about to become a father, he was motivated and proud to take on the project. ''Magic Town'' had nearly a hundred songs that took almost two years to produce, and many were improvised by Chen when he first worked on them. Chen considered the diversity of musical styles and incorporated elements from various genres such as folk, jazz, rock, electronic dance, new age, etc. He also took into account the fact that children are "exposed to advanced knowledge and culture." Therefore, he used trendy elements for nursery rhymes. The overall experience of working on the project was much different compared to Chen's past film and television works in terms of emotions. In film music, various emotions are present, including negative ones such as anger, fear, anxiety, and depression; Chen felt these as he composed. ''Magic Town'' was different because of its overall positive, bright themes.<ref>{{zh|陈致逸原创音乐}} (January 6, 2017). [https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/J6rgWkZGNO3csItJoQrZxA "{{zh|致我们最可爱的宝贝}}"]. ''Weixin''.

Chen went beyond limits in producing his work for them to reach their best quality. He incorporated new instruments into his works, such as traditional Chinese instruments, which, according to Chen, made the style of the game music "refreshing." He was also interested in integrating elements of Chinese folk music into the soundtrack to create a "new national style" of folk music to promote Chinese culture. While working on the game, he also built his own fan base. He began to care more about players' preferences as regular communication with them brought changes to his ideas; he made his music more inclusive and integrated more elements into it. Through all this, Chen established his confidence in music as he formed his style and direction.<ref name="ChenZhiyiZhihu"/>

Many filmmakers were involved in the game's story creation, martial arts action, art style, costume design, etc. In the process, the game incorporated cinematic creation techniques. Following this, Chen requested to produce the landing music at the level of film music. He composed the soundtrack "Thousand People, Thousand Faces" ({{zh|千人千面}}), which plays at the beginning of the game as the player selects and modifies their character. Chen noted that the landing music shapes the first impression of the whole game. Therefore, the music was based not solely on the theme of martial arts but on the curiosity and enthusiasm felt by players when exploring the game world. Also noted was that treating the music with high requirements and quality was unavoidable.<ref>{{zh|陈致逸原创音乐}} (December 22, 2015).

It was a challenge since the theme may not be suitable for singing, and for Chen to adapt the work of a senior composer he admired. Previously, Chen arranged theme songs by himself.

{{See also|Soundtrack/Background}}
<blockquote>Actually, Chen Zhiyi tried to do this thing a long time ago. [When it comes to] the combination and fusion of [Chinese] folk music and symphonic music, the audience and players are more concerned about whether folk music and symphonic music can be integrated, rather than put together, like rice and eggs [to make] fried rice with eggs. I think that this is really a question of how beautiful does the music sound and does the music transmit that spirit of Chinese culture. I believe our original music this time is produced to a really high standard.<br /><br />{{zh|其实陈致逸很早以前就在尝试做这个东西。现在的民乐跟交响乐的联合和结合，观众大家玩家们更关心的是，民乐和交响乐能不能融合，而不是放在一起，只是一加一炒蛋炒饭一样。我觉得其实这个还是音乐是不是漂亮、这个音乐里面有没有中国的精神。我们这次的原声音乐来说我觉得是高水准的。}}<br /><br />&mdash; Dong An, ''"Songs of Travelers" — Behind the Scenes of the Music of Liyue''</blockquote>

===2017: ''Midnight Radio'' and ''Time Tunnel''===
[[File:Midnight Radio.png|thumb|160px]]
<blockquote>I used to own a bar, on Shanghai's Huangjincheng Road<!--黄金城道-->, which is a very quiet lane. One day I was walking on this lane alone at midnight, and an idea of rhythm suddenly came. I told it to my partner Chenming Tian, and it really hit off with the lyrics he came out. This song has a bit of dark humour, which is especially suitable for fast-paced, vaguely melodic rap, and it was my favourite genre at the time. So in one go, this song was born.<br /><br />{{zh|我曾经开过酒吧，在上海黄金城道，那是一条非常安静的小路。有天午夜我一个人走在这条路上，乐思就突然袭来，我讲给了我的搭档词人田辰明听，与他有感而发的歌词一拍即合。这首歌有一点黑色幽默，特别适合喜欢速度快的说唱，这种隐约有旋律的RAP，而且这是当时我特别喜欢的风格。于是各方面一蹴而就，这首歌诞生了。}}<br /><br />&mdash; Description of ''Midnight Radio''</blockquote>
On April 14, 2017, Chen released the singles "Midnight Radio" ({{zh|午夜电台}}) and "Time Tunnel" ({{zh|时光隧道}}).<ref name="ChenNetEase04142017TT"/><ref name="ChenNetEase04142017MR"/> He composed both songs while Chenming Tian ({{zh|田辰明}})<!--Tián Chénmíng--> wrote the lyrics.

[[File:Time Tunnel.png|thumb|160px]]
"Midnight Radio" started with a rhythm that came to Chen's mind as he walked down an empty road at night. He shared this with Tian, who came up with lyrics. Tian later explained in a comment that the convenience store mentioned at the beginning of the song is a {{w|Lawson (store)|Lawson store}} located at the intersection of Fuxing Road<!--复兴路--> and Maoming Road<!--茂名路-->. What also inspired the lyrics are the times he squatted on the side of the road to smoke cigarettes in the middle of the night; the clerk at the store would play the midnight radio.<ref>{{zh|陈致逸工作室}} (April 14, 2017).

===2018: ''You're Not Here'' and ''A Cup of Moon''===
[[File:You're Not Here.png|thumb|160px]]
In 2018, Chen collaborated with lyricist Qian Jing ({{zh|镜千}}) to produce the song "You're Not Here" ({{zh|你，不在这里}}). The song was based on a poem that Jing wrote at the time his grandfather had passed away, two years prior to the song's creation. When Chen read the poem for the first time, his grandfather had also recently passed away. He decided to finish the song in one go as his grandmother was also seriously ill. And before releasing the song, Chen had many of his relatives and his grandmother listen to it before she died. The song was released on February 1, 2018.<ref name="ChenNetEase02012018"/> Chen said:

<blockquote>I personally think that this is a completely non-commercial song about family affection, expressing my deepest thoughts. I hope that others can understand my feelings, but I don’t want it to be overly snooped on by people. I hesitated for a long time between publishing it or not. In the end, I chose to let more people hear it and call for more memories of my loved ones.<br /><br />{{zh|我私心里认为这是一首完全不商业的关于亲情的歌，表达了我内心里最深处的思念。我希望别人可以体会我这种心情，但又不想它被人过分地窥探，在发布与否之间犹豫了很久，最后还是选择让更多地人听到，呼唤更多关于亲人的回忆。}}<ref>{{zh|陈致逸原创音乐}} (February 1, 2018).

Chen and Jing next worked on  "A Cup of Moon" ({{zh|一杯月}}), together with music engineers Jiade He ({{zh|何迦德}})<!--Hé Jiādé--> and Kaola ({{zh|考拉}})<!--Kǎolā-->, and mixing engineer Junjie Liu ({{zh|刘俊杰}})<!--Liú Jùnjié-->. It was a song originally made for the [[#Qingqin Qingqing|Qingqin Qingqing]] ({{zh|轻琴謦磬}}) band, hence its length of six minutes. Lin Yin ({{zh|银临}})<!--Yín Lín-->, a singer Chen invited to participate in the project, persistently suggested shortening the song, but Chen continued with his vision. He also completed the arrangement in one sitting during an eight-hour-long live broadcast.<ref name="CupMoonNetEaseColumn">{{zh|陈致逸}} (November 12, 2018).

===2019: ''Being Towards Death''===
[[File:Being Towards Death.png|thumb|160px]]
After two years of production, Chen digitally released his first original album, ''Being Towards Death''<!--向死而生-->, on April 2, 2019.<ref name="ChenNetEase04022019"/> It includes various works created over ten years and features new recordings of previously released works, such as  "Midnight Radio," "Time Tunnel," and "A Cup of Moon." The production of the album was supported through crowdfunding. With an initial goal of 30,000 RMB, the project raised 38,000.<ref name="BeingTowardsDeathModian">[https://zhongchou.modian.com/item/30175.html "{{zh|陈致逸首张原创合辑《向死而生》：人世风灯，向死而生}}"]. ''Modian''.

All songs he worked on got revised at least twice before arriving at the finished product; "A Cup of Moon" got revised at least three times. He also described Chen's attitude towards music as "rigorous."<ref>{{zh|陈致逸原创音乐}} (September 30, 2018). [https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/MQt3mWDu05_afT0BV-i-NQ "{{zh|首张众筹原创歌曲专辑《向死而生》10月1日正式开售！}}"].

<blockquote>Chen really went out of his way for his precious album. Every day, he worked until one or two o’clock in the morning before going home, just to optimize and re-optimize all the songs at the last minute. Even several songs were re-edited directly and recorded again.
