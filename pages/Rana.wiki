==Profile==
Rana is a Forest Watcher, responsible for guiding travelers through the forest and caring for its ecosystem. She met the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] while on patrol, when they fended off some [[fungus|fungi]] that were attacking her. She quickly befriended them, witnessing the Traveler's combat prowess as they eliminated monsters and [[The Withering|Withering Zones]] alike. 

After finishing up her duties, Rana escorted the Traveler and Paimon to her hometown of [[Vimara Village]], where they learned about the recent mysterious disappearances of local children before heading out again to clean up more Withering Zones. On their way back, they saw [[Iotham]] running into a cave and followed him, finding him trapped in a Withering Zone surrounded by monsters. Without regard to her safety, Rana charged in to save him. She succeeded, but the exposure to the Withering caused her to become severely ill.

After escorting Iotham back to the village, the Traveler and Paimon rushed back to the cave to find Rana being protected by [[Arana]], an [[Aranara]]. She was also the one who had protected Iotham in the Withering Zone. Arana told them that Rana needed [[Bija]] to be purged of [[The Withering|Marana]]'s corruption. After going on a [[Aranyaka|lengthy adventure]] where they met and befriended the Aranara, the Traveler finally obtained the Bija. Giving it to Rana, she woke up from her coma and recalled everything about her time with Arana, whom she had befriended in her youth but learned she'd forgotten all about, much to her dismay. As they rekindled their friendship, a light appeared from her chest to coalesce into a {{Dendro}} [[Vision]] in her hands, showing that she had been recognized by the gods.

With her newly acquired Vision secured on her waist, Rana decided to go on a journey with Arana, thanking the Traveler and hoping that they would meet again in the future.

===Appearance===
Rana is a young woman with the typical female NPC model. She has long brown hair with straight-cut bangs and brown eyes, and wears the female Forest Ranger uniform. After completing the Aranyaka quest series, a {{Dendro}} Vision is visible on her waist.

==Trivia==
* She is the first real NPC to ever get their [[Vision]] onscreen.
** Rana's Vision on her character model has the back side facing outward instead of inward. This is also reflected in her [[Genius Invokation TCG]] [[Rana (Support Card)|Support Card]].
* When assisting the Player, Rana fights like an {{Enemy|Eremite Axe Vanguard}}. However, she does not use the Sand Throw attack.
