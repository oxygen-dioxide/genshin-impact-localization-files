|description    = A unique-looking long stone table that may be found in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]], imposing its rather impressive surface area on its surroundings. As the name suggests, this table's design is inspired by large shields. Its unique pitted design not only provides excellent support for the user's arms but also allows their torsos to lean closer to the table center, thus improving on the usual "long-table experience." However, this complex outer structure also causes high construction and maintenance costs, which have prevented its widespread use.
