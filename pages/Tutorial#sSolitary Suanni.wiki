|text1    = An illuminated beast that dwells deep within the mountains that can use {{Color|help|Hydro}} and {{Color|help|Anemo}} simultaneously in battle. Render it Frozen while it is gathering {{Color|help|Hydro}}-aligned adeptal energy, before using {{Color|help|Shatter, Melt, or other Elemental Reactions}} to break the ice and cause it to enter an immobile state. When it is gathering {{Color|help|Anemo}}-aligned adeptal energy, use {{Color|help|attacks from Elements that can react with Anemo}} to destroy the Spiritwind Pearls summoned during the process to achieve the same advantage.
