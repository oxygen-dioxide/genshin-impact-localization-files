* Deals {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.
* If there are nearby targets with the {{Color|Geo element}}, it will drain a large amount of {{Color|Geo element}} from a maximum of 2 such targets. This effect does not cause DMG.

{{Description|A true master of stone may carve jade and shape gold.}}
'''Dominus Lapidis''' is [[Zhongli]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{TalentNote|particles|Any DMG dealt by this skill|0.5}}
** This particle generation has a cooldown of '''1.5s'''.
* {{TalentNote|icd|All DMG dealt by this skill|plural=1}}
* Holding this ability will drain 8 [[Gauge Unit Theory|gauge units]] of {{Geo}} from a maximum of 20 objects (e.g., ores, Hilichurl rock shields, etc.) and 6 gauge units of {{Geo}} from a maximum of 3 enemies within a 10m radius.
* While holding the Elemental Skill, Zhongli's [[Interruption Resistance]] is greatly increased.<ref name="Zhongli Adjustments">HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/7524 To All Travelers: Regarding Adjustments to Zhongli]</ref>
* Multiple nearby Stone Steles will resonate with each other. Additionally, other [[Geo Constructs]] can take resonance from multiple nearby Stone Steles.
** The Stone Stele's horizontal resonance range (the radius) with other Geo Constructs is about twice the size of the Stele's {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}} pulse range. The resonance range is also slightly less than the range of [[Albedo]]'s [[Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma]]. The vertical resonance range is about 50% of the Stele's height counted from the bottom to the top of the Stele.
** The Stele will scan for new nearby Geo Constructs just before the resonance tick.
* Stone Stele will resonate with pillars created by [[Geo Samachurl]]s.<ref name="Samachurl Pillar Resonating">Imgur: [https://imgur.com/eSiYfAM Geo Samachurl Pillar Resonating]</ref>
** This implies that Zhongli can resonate with enemy Geo Constructs as well.
* A maximum of 3 Geo Constructs is allowed on the field between all players. If another player places a Geo construct after the limit has been reached, the oldest Geo construct will be replaced first.
** Geo Constructs created from [[Wake of Earth]] do not contribute to this cap.
* The AoE range of the Jade Shield debuff, which decreases opponents' Elemental RES and Physical RES, is a cylinder with a radius of '''7.5''' meters and a height of '''10''' meters.
*{{TalentNote|character=Zhongli|snapshot|Stone Stele's AoE DMG and Resonance DMG}}
*{{TalentNote|character=Zhongli|talent=Dominus Lapidis|ascension|1|Resonant Waves|increases the [[Shield Strength]] of characters with the Jade Shield by 5% every time the Jade Shield takes damage, up to a maximum of 25% increased Shield Strength. This lasts until the Jade Shield disappears.}}
*{{TalentNote|character=Zhongli|talent=Dominus Lapidis|ascension|2|Dominance of Earth|increases the damage from holding Dominus Lapidis, creating a Stone Stele, and Stone Stele resonance by 1.9% of Zhongli's Max HP.}}
