{{Description|A true master of stone may carve jade and shape gold.}}
'''Dominus Lapidis''' is [[Zhongli]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|any DMG dealt by this skill|0.5}}
** This particle generation has a cooldown of '''1.5s'''.
* The Stone Stele has a maximum duration of '''30'''s.
* From '''2'''s after creating the Stone Stele, it resonates with itself and nearby [[Geo Construct]]s every '''2''' seconds dealing {{Color|Geo DMG}}.
** Stone Steles will resonate with Geo Constructs created by enemies.
** Geo Constructs other than the Stone Stele itself, can take resonance from multiple nearby Stone Steles.
** Despite the animation of the resonance appearing like a pulse that gradually spreads out, all enemies in the AoE of the resonance take DMG simultaneously.
** {{Talent Note|character=Zhongli|snapshot|Stone Stele's AoE DMG and Resonance DMG}}
* While holding the Elemental Skill, Zhongli's [[Interruption Resistance]] is greatly increased.
* When holding is complete, Zhongli will drain '''8''' [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge units]] of {{Geo}} from a maximum of 20 objects (e.g., ores, Hilichurl rock shields, etc.) and '''6''' gauge units of {{Geo}} from a maximum of 2 enemies within a 10&nbsp;m radius.
* The AoE of the Jade Shield RES debuff is a cylinder with a radius of '''7.5'''&nbsp;meters and a height of '''10'''&nbsp;meters.

;<big>Passive Effects</big>
*{{Talent Note|character=Zhongli|talent=Dominus Lapidis|ascension|1|Resonant Waves|Increases the [[Shield Strength]] of characters with the Jade Shield by 5% every time the Jade Shield takes damage, up to a maximum of 25% increased Shield Strength. This lasts until the Jade Shield disappears.}}
*{{Talent Note|character=Zhongli|talent=Dominus Lapidis|ascension|2|Dominance of Earth|Increases the damage from holding Dominus Lapidis, creating a Stone Stele, and Stone Stele resonance by 1.9% of Zhongli's Max HP.}}
