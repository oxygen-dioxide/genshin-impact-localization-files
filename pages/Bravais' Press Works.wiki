{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Bravais' Press Works|It|Bravais' Press Works}} contains the Forging Press, which is used to refine {{Item|Arkhium Stock}} into {{Item|Arkhium Lumenite}} for the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] "[[Arkhium Forge]]". Upon doing so, the press cannot be used again as the chamber containing it is completely flooded.</p>}}

{{Tutorial|Forging Press}}

==Location==
Bravais' Press Works can be accessed via three ways:
# A waterway from the {{Enemy|Millennial Pearl Seahorse}}'s chamber.
# A hidden tunnel in [[Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop]], right before the final room. Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop is accessible during the {{Quest|Road to the Singularity}}.
# A [[current]] at the end of [[Geode Mine Shaft]], available after finishing the {{Quest|An Eye for an Eye}}.

==How to Operate==
Before operating the press, the player must obtain all seven {{Item|Mysterious Ore}} items, which will automatically combine to form {{Item|Arkhium Stock}}.

# The terminal in front of the press is unpowered, and attempting to use it reports that the pipe pressure must be normalized first.
# Close the three valves on the walls by rotating their handwheels until they stop emitting steam. One will require installation of a {{Item|Handwheel (Bravais' Press Works)}} found nearby on the floor of the chamber.
#: The handwheel is surrounded by two [[Nimble Harvester Mek]]s

# Insert the {{Item|Arkhium Stock}} in the center of the press.
# Interact with the terminal in front of the press to activate the power supply system.
# Interact with the terminal again to begin operating the press.
# Watch the Arkhium Stock in the press; it will gradually grow brighter until it emits a flash; when it does, interact with the terminal. Repeat until the system overheats.
# {{Enemy|Pyro Slime|x = 4}} will spawn at the center of the press; defeat them.
# Apply {{Hydro}} or {{Cryo}} to the center of the press until the heat meter above it disappears. (This may have happened already due to elemental attacks against the slimes.)
# {{Enemy|Large Pyro Slime|x = 1}} will spawn; defeat it.
# The terminal in front of the press reports that the cooling system must be activated. The terminal for that is nearby, down a short ramp at the north-west area of the chamber. Select "Activate Cooling Process."
# The cooling and drainage terminal reports that the water intake is blocked. Drop to the bottom of the chamber and look for a large stone with blue veins. Destroy it, and water will flood into the chamber.
# Return to the press terminal and operate the press again as before until it reports that water has entered the system.
# Go down the ramp to the other terminal and interact with it. The terminal will report that the drainage pipe is blocked.
# Dive into the water and obtain the Water Blades ability from the nearby [[Xenochromatic Creature|Xenochromatic Hunter's Ray]].
# Go to where the large stone was destroyed previously to find a [[Xenochromatic Creature|Xenochromatic Hat Jellyfish]] trapped by [[Fontemer Seagrass]]. Use the Water Blades ability to free it, then obtain its Hat-Shaped Bombs ability.
# Locate the two drainage pipes which are blocked by [[Red Meanies]]. Use the Hat-Shaped Bombs to destroy them and unblock the pipes.
# Return to the drainage terminal and interact with it to drain the water.
# Return to the press terminal and operate the press again as before until a seal ruptures and the chamber is completely flooded.
# Swim to the center of the press and obtain the {{Item|Arkhium Lumenite}}.
# Collect the [[Precious Chest]] in the newly opened passage, then proceed to the [[Current]]. The current ends at the ruins under the [[Statue of the Seven]] in the [[Liffey Region]], where [[Desnos]] is found.

==Interactables==
===Forging Press Device Operation Standards===
This interactable is found next to the main terminal of Bravais's Press Works in the Submerged Stony Path underground area.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:1. Pre-Startup Preparation
:Step 1: Before initiating the pressing process, the operator should wear protective gear at all times and perform a comprehensive equipment inspection.
:Step 2: Before starting up the equipment, the operator must {{color|buzzword|ensure the stock has been placed correctly}} to prevent mechanical damage to the equipment due to idling.
:Step 3: {{color|buzzword|Check the equipment's energy supply system}} to ensure that the equipment can run within normal parameters.
:Once the above inspection steps have been completed, {{color|buzzword|the pressing process can be initiated at the terminal}}.

:2. Pressing Process Operation
:When the pressing process is activated, the press will cause the stock to enter an {{color|buzzword|activated state}}. You need {{color|buzzword|to activate the press when the stock is giving off an orange-red light}}. Operating the press with the hammers can effectively induce deformation, so the operator must pay close attention to the state of the stock at all times during operation and {{color|buzzword|manually operate the press with the hammers with the right timing}}.

:3. Troubleshooting
:To facilitate the operator's self-inspection, a fail-safe system has been installed on the base of currently available equipment models. The operator can troubleshoot system problems based on the errors reported by the fail-safe system. For more detailed instructions, please consult the {{color|buzzword|"Emergency Response Handbook: 3rd Edition"}}.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Maintenance Log===
This interactable is found on a desk at the bottom of Bravais's Press Works in the Submerged Stony Path underground area.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maintenance Log:''' "All I can do now is to try to stop the cooling system and try to seal the leaking areas. It's just a stopgap measure, however."
:'''Maintenance Log:''' "If someone did remove the seals and operate the cooling system, the whole room would be instantly filled with a huge amount of water. The Forging Press will be utterly ruined."
:'''Maintenance Log:''' "Though no one other than Bravais really cares about the devices in here, I suppose a prayer that the {{color|buzzword|emergency drain}} proves useful couldn't hurt."
{{Dialogue End}}

===Emergency Handbook: Third Edition===
This interactable is located below the entrance platform of Bravais's Press Works in the Submerged Stony Path underground area.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:Common problems and appropriate emergency response measures are listed in this manual. If an error not included in the manual occurs, please contact Senior Researcher Bravais at once.

:Common errors include the following:
:Insufficient Energy Supply:
:This error is usually caused by insufficient pipe pressure, specifically when an indicator gas leak occurs from the valve or exterior surface of the pipe. To address this, adjust the valve by turning the handwheel until the valve is no longer leaking indicator gasses.
:System Overheated:
:This error indicates the press temperature is too high. In this state, the entire system is more hazardous. Addressing this is a high priority. The recommended method is to decrease the temperature of the press's ventilation window and initiate the cooling program to dissipate the heat.
:Water Entering the System:
:When this error occurs, abort the process and perform an inspection of the environmental sealing to prevent reoccurrence. In case of emergency, the emergency drainage function can also be activated to temporarily address the unexpected presence of excess water.
:Blocked Emergency Drainage Pipe:
:This error is normally caused by a foreign substance blocking the drainage pipe. When this error occurs, simply inspect and clear the drainage pipe.

:Repair Requests & Feedback Log:
:...
:Repair Request: Evidence of leakage on the ground found near the cooling system water intake under the press. Requesting urgent maintenance.
:Maintenance Outcome: Temporary sealant has been applied to the water intake to prevent water ingress. Due to the risk of backflow when using the cooling system, its use has been suspended until a permanent solution can be implemented.
