==Description==
A nagamaki sword designed by one of [[Tatarasuna]]'s inspectors.<br>
It is said that the diagram is as simple and upright as that inspector was.

For a long time, before the introduction of the outlander technology that helped build the [[Mikage Furnace]],<br>
Tatarasuna smelted iron using the traditional "Tatara Metalworking Method."<br>
After [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]] became the inspector, he was for a time obsessed with the grim loveliness of steel.<br>
He thus consulted the similarly inclined Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki for advice,<br>
With the result being this tough and simple sword, the Daitatara Nagamasa.

Although he was only the foster son of the [[Mikoshi Clan]], and although his [[Chiyo|foster mother]] had stained the reputation of the Mikoshi,<br>
And even though Mikoshi's only legitimate heir, [[Iwakura Michihiro|Michihiro]], abandoned him and disappeared,<br>
His self-admitted stupidity and loyalty led him to cherish the Mikoshi name all the more.<br>
He strove to enter the government and got rid of the family's bad reputation with his diligence and righteousness.

When his yoriki [[Katsuragi]] was connected with but a single trace of misconduct, he had him executed without mercy.<br>
Ever since then, the name of the sword and his title were changed forever.
==Lore==
This sword was originally forged and wielded by [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]] at the [[Mikage Furnace]] in Inazuma. It was originally named the Daitatara Nagamasa, before being used to kill [[Katsuragi]]. The sword was later named "Katsuragikiri Nagamasa" (a play on words: Nagamasa who cuts Katsuragi).

More lore on the sword is shown in the 3.3 Archon Quest detailing the [[Wanderer|Wanderer's]] involvement at Tatarasuna.

==Availability==
*[[Forging]]
**Its diagram is obtained from a chest contained in [[The Arsenal]].

==Trivia==
* The weapon is mentioned in the [[Rather Aged Notes]].
* During the [[Version 3.3]] [https://youtu.be/oTIHLsa0bj0?t=72 trailer] (at 1:12), a man can briefly be seen holding this weapon during what appears to be [[Wanderer]]'s memories.

===Etymology===
*In this weapon's original name, Daitatara Nagamasa, {{Lang|"Daitatara"|ja=大たたら}} means "Great Tatara", while {{Lang|Nagamasa|ja=長正}} is naturally derived from Mikoshi Nagamasa's name.
**{{Lang|"Katsuragikiri"|ja=桂木斬}} means "Katsuragi-slashing." Because this sword was partially named after Nagamasa, this epithet became associated with both the sword and himself.
