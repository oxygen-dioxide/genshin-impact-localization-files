'''Amrita''' is a substance created from the remains of the original Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]], after she was slain at [[Tunigi Hollow]] during the [[Cataclysm]]. It is described as a pure and sweet dew. It is capable of repelling the [[Abyss]], and is also the source of the [[Khvarena]]'s power.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref>

Most of the Amrita can be found in [[Vourukasha Oasis]], where it nourishes the land and maintains a seal over the [[Abyssal Corruption]] in the area. It was also from Amrita that [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] grew the [[Harvisptokhm]], which now serves as both the home of Egeria and the "core" of Amrita. 

The [[Pari]] were originally created when [[Simurgh]]'s Khvarena mixed with the Amrita. They believe that they and all memories that belong to Khvarena will eventually return to the Harvisptokhm (that is, to Amrita).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Heart of Amrita}}</ref>
