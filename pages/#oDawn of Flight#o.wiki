|description    = A floating platform made of resilient fabric and lightweight "Ashen Aratiku Wood," found around the Flower-Feather Clan.<br>The original intent for these platforms was to expand the increasingly crowded landing spaces, offering more landing options for Qucusaurs. However, due to their competitive nature and strong territorial instincts, the Qucusaurs were unwilling to abandon their familiar spots, and the platforms failed to meet their intended purpose. Fortunately, the manager of the flight trial grounds realized that these platforms could be used in another way &mdash; as destinations for novices undergoing transition training. It turns out that this has been rather effective.
