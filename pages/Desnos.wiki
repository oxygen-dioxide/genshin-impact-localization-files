{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Desnos:''' When will I be able to start working at the Institute again...
:{{DIcon}} Are you still working here?
::'''Desnos:''' Honorary Senior Researcher! So happy to see you! Take a seat, I'll make some coffee... Oh. I drank all the coffee. I guess I'll have to pour you some water.
::'''Desnos:''' Right. As you see, I'm continuing my qualifications review work here. But... well, as before, there are still very few adventurers coming to apply for work.
::{{DIcon}} Do you even have coffee to drink here?
:::'''Desnos:''' Of course. This is an official Fontaine Research Institute satellite office. It has everything an office should have, in full compliance with the full standards for office supplies.
:::'''Desnos:''' And while my office might lack walls, it does have a ceiling. I'm doing much better than all those project teams who had their entire offices blown to smithereens.
:{{DIcon}} I'll let you get on with your work.
::'''Desnos:''' You're too kind. Take care.
