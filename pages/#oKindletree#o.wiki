|description    = A young sapling whose yellowish leaves don't have a high water content, meaning it easily dries out. It is said that in the distant past, its trunk and branches contained a flammable substance making it the perfect firewood. It stands out because of its color, is easy to find, and has helped many an adventurer in the past. For these reasons, it is called the "Kindletree".
