==Summary==
The Traveler learns from Katheryne that Inazuma Adventurers' Guild has been exploring [[Seirai Island]] recently, but their exploration has been impeded by the wild storms on the island. The guild has sent two adventurers, [[Eiko]] and [[Taisuke]] to investigate, but they haven't come up with any leads. Katheryne suggests the Traveler could help investigate and so the Traveler sets off to Seirai Island.

After arriving on the island, the Traveler meets up with Eiko and she explains the current situation: they are able to explore the periphery of the island but attempting to get closer to the center of the island is too dangerous due to the effects of [[Balethunder]]. Their current progress has led up to discovering some strange stone structures they believe to be called "Warding Stones," but these stones are busted up and they lack any knowledge of what to do with them. Although they've made zero progress on the Warding Stones, the group has noticed some peculiar tracks of a cat, but Eiko and Taisuke decide to focus on the Warding Stones while the Traveler and Paimon leave and follow the cat's tracks.

Following the tracks, the Traveler arrives at a shrine in noticeably better condition and with fairer weather than the rest of the island. There they meet a mysterious talking cat named "[[Neko]]," who proclaims itself to be the "provisional head priestess of the [[Asase Shrine]]." Neko has been trying to keep the shrine in good condition, because [[Hibiki]] would grieve should she see the shrine in a sorry state. As such, Neko is worried about the shrine's damaged Offering Box and agrees to teach the Traveler about the Warding Stones in exchange for fixing the offering box. The Traveler fixes the offering box and Neko explains how to seal the four Warding Stones and informs the Traveler about the "bird of most prodigious size" that the stones were meant to keep sealed.

Returning to Eiko and Taisuke, the Traveler tells them what they learned from [[Neko]] and Taisuke gets excited at the prospect of meeting a talking cat. Eiko keeps Taisuke on subject and together the group discusses how to seal all the Warding Stones and they set off to find them. The group successfully seals the first two Warding Stones but finds themselves puzzled at the location of the other two stones. The Traveler realizes it's up in the sky and departs from the rest of the group to travel up through a [[Phase Gate]] to search for them. After sealing the last two Warding Stones up in the sky, a huge platform is suddenly formed from the floating stones up in the sky. Deciding to investigating, the Traveler steps onto the platform and encounters the [[Thunder Manifestation]]. After defeating it, the Traveler continues their investigation and finds a strange feather called the [[Peculiar Pinion]].

The Traveler returns to Eiko and Taisuke who've both noticed that the storm has passed after all four Warding Stones were sealed. The Traveler tells them what happened and they're perplexed about the strange phenomenon that the Traveler experienced. Taisuke examines the Peculiar Pinion but has no knowledge of it and suggests to put up a commission. Having solved the issue of the storm, Eiko decides to return to the guild to submit their report, but Taisuke insists they visit the Asase Shrine first to see the talking cat.
