'''Key Sigils''' are items found in [[Enkanomiya]]. There are a total of five types and each one of them can release matching seals found throughout the map. Releasing these seals can reward the player with [[Chests]] or advance certain [[World Quests]].

When a Key Sigil is within close proximity of a player, an icon will appear on their [[minimap]] along with a sound effect, similar to the [[oculi]]. The seals can sometimes be obscured by a [[Sunfire Phantasm]], switch between [[Whitenight]] and [[Evernight]] to uncover the seals.

59 Key Sigils can be found throughout Enkanomiya. When they are all collected, the player will be granted the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[One Key for Each Lock]]." Two Key Sigils are obtained during the [[The Still Water's Flow]] world quest, but these do not count towards the achievement.
