|text      = Do you still happen to remember those two good fellows who helped cook in the cafeteria? Recently, they've been regularly "passing by" my office talking about a certain pair of blond and white-haired prison pals of theirs.

Judging from their recent behavior, aside from intending to invite you two over for a meal, I'd hazard a guess that they're preparing something for me as well.

I suppose I'll just carry on pretending I have no idea what's going on...

Anyway, feel free to drop by whenever you're free, and I really do mean whenever. I'm guessing that you're already quite proficient at harnessing the power of Hydro, but forgive me for reminding you — be careful on your way over.

(If you come up against anything that you struggle to deal with using {{Hydro}}, just make sure you stay safe.)
