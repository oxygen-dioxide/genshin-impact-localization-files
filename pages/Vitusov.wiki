{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vitusov:''' Half an hour to finish a triple portion of "Surf, Turf, and Perch"... Do you think that's possible?
:{{DIcon}} It's worth a shot.
::'''Vitusov:''' I think so too!
::'''Vitusov:''' Before coming to Natlan, I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to stomach the local food.
::'''Vitusov:''' But it seems like I was completely overthinking it! A big, filling, high-calorie meal is just what the doctor ordered.
::'''Vitusov:''' Hold on, let me think about this... It's about time I had a go at this limited-time clean plate challenge.
:{{DIcon}} Just be wise to your limits, alright?
::'''Vitusov:''' Okay, understood.
