'''Spirited Valor''' is [[Shikanoin Heizou]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Heizou's hair is styled in a short mullet, and his bangs are pushed back with a black headband.

Heizou's attire consists of a sleeveless white collared tunic worn over a sleeveless black undershirt with a mustard yellow tassel decoration dangling from his right shoulder, detached black sleeves with buckles that cover his arms and palms and a black choker around his neck. He fashions a brown cloud-patterned ''haori'' coat that he ties around his waist, a thick dark belt with two pale red tassels hanging from it where a sheathed jitte and his {{Anemo}} [[Vision]] is attached, golden-brown knee-length ''hakama'' pants and dark knee-high red-strapped sandals that expose part of his feet.
