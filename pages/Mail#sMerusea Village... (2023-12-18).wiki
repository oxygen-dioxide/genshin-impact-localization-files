|text      = According to our previous public pronouncements, it is my birthday today.

[[Furina]]'s birthday is a public holiday, and it remains so to this day.

On the centenary of when I took up my post, someone proposed that my birthday should also be designated as a commemorative holiday. In actuality, I do not know the exact date of my birthday.

As the spring and fall weather in [[Fontaine]] is less than satisfactory, and I am not particularly fond of summer, I finally settled on this date.

In years past, on this day I would usually extricate myself from duties at the Court and go to [[Merusea Village]], visiting the [[Melusine]]s who lived there.

This time, I would like to invite you to come along with me. I have heard you are often traveling around Fontaine lately, and are well acquainted with many Melusines. If you were present, they would surely be overjoyed.

It was merely a sudden notion I had, I suppose I may be intruding. I prepared a gift by way of thanks. Should you be available, I look forward to meeting you.
