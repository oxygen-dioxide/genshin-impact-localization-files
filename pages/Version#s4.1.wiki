Moreover, formulas for which the player runs out of materials will not immediately be moved to the bottom of the list; the list will only be updated after switching to another screen.<!--Processing was not updated for the latter, and I cannot test for the former as there are not enough processing recipes to fill the entire screen. Mystic Offering was not updated for the former, and I will not sacrifice my entire 5-star artifact stash to test whether it does the latter.-->
