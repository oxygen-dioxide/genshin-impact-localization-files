'''Crafting Methods''' ''(unofficial name)'' are permanent systems in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that allow players to obtain certain items out of various starting materials.

Some like [[Crafting]] are instantaneous, while others like [[Forging]] have a processing time. [[Cooking]] is the only crafting method that features a minigame. Certain Crafting Methods allow for a character to assist the process, and may yield additional products if that character possesses a [[Utility Passive#Bonuses on Crafting Methods|Utility Passive]] related to that Crafting Method.
