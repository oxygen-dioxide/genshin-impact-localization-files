|description    = A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but can also be trained to deliver messages.<br>This type of pigeon is mostly active in mountainous regions. It sports the colors of the mountain rocks and the red earth on its feathers, giving it a graceful and distinguished appearance. After a long time bathing in the sunlight of the Realm Within, the brilliant posture of the Crimsonflank Pigeon can even attract the light-loving Sun Crabs.
