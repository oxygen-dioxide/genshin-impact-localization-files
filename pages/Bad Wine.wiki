{{Description|Many years have passed since [[Vennessa]] took the keys of [[Mondstadt City|Mondstadt]] and founded the [[Knights of Favonius|Ordo Favonius]] to watch over her beloved city. But a [[Fatui|new power]] appeared, spreading its dark influence across the lands and imposing a "blood tax" upon its subjects. New heroes must step forward to protect all that is dear.}}
'''Bad Wine''' is Chapter 1 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
Many years passed since [[Mondstadt]] drove out the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy|aristocracy]] and [[Vennessa]]'s founding of the still operating, [[Knights of Favonius]].

In an underground [[Fatui]] [[Haeresys|arena]], [[Krupp]] is putting test subjects to fight. As the [[Anthony (Manga)|latest one]] fails, [[The Doctor|Il Dottore]], disappointed with the experiment, threatens to use Krupp as their next test subject. Desperate to avoid that fate, Krupp suggests they get recruits from Mondstadt instead.

At [[Dawn Winery Manor|Diluc's manor]], a banquet is being hosted by [[Diluc]] himself. Dottore and Krupp arrive and arrange a meeting with the master. In a separate room, the three sit down with [[Church of Favonius]] Seneschal [[Seamus Pegg|Seamus]], and Cavalry Captain [[Kaeya]]. They negotiate the recruitment of Mondstadt's citizens into the Fatui for protection. Disliking the idea, Diluc ends the conversation.

Dotorre leaves the manor in anger as Krupp offers to look for an alternative. Kaeya approaches him and persuades Krupp to visit the underground cellars of the manor. Krupps enters the cellars and is attacked by the [[Diluc|Darknight Hero]], who forces him to reveal the Fatui's intentions with the recruits. Before Krupp can say anything, Dottore eliminates him.

Diluc resumes the banquet while Dottore leaves, passing by [[Amber]].
