'''Yakshas''' were a race of particularly fierce [[illuminated beast]]s,<ref name="EotL">{{Ref/Quest|End of the Line}}</ref> both in appearance and their martial prowess. To quell the lingering hatred of fallen gods from the [[Archon War]], which caused plagues, curses, and miasmas all over [[Liyue]]. [[Morax]] called upon the yakshas to help wage a never-ending war against the monsters and other such manifestations of the gods' hatred.<ref name="YTGA">{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref><ref name="yaksha trailer">{{Ref/Quest|Glimmers of the Vigilant Yaksha|note=Cutscene}}</ref>

Over time, this task stained them with karmic debt which wore away at their souls and sanity. Madness and despair overwhelmed the yakshas: Some turned on each other, others succumbed to the darkness, and yet others vanished. Now, only one yaksha remains: Alatus, who currently goes by the name [[Xiao]].<ref name="YTGA" /><ref name="yaksha trailer" />

==Overview==
===Appearance===
[[File:Yakshas - Masks.png|thumb|180px|The five foremost Yakshas' masks]]
Unlike most of the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti who take on completely beastlike appearances, the yakshas seen so far have all taken humanoid appearances.<ref name="yaksha trailer" /> However, they retain beastlike qualities through their masks and attire, and each is associated with an animal as well.<ref group="Note">[[Pervases]], after his death, had his spirit indwell a crane statue, as seen in [[Insights of Drifting Dreams]]. His Chinese name, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=铜雀|zh_tl=Copper Bird}}, further points to his birdlike aspect.</ref><ref group="Note">The Chinese name for Alatus is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=金鹏|zh_rm=Jīnpéng|zh_tl=Gold {{w|Peng (mythology)|Peng}}}}, after the mythological bird. The tattoo on his right arm, which vaguely resembles a bird viewed from behind with its head in profile, depicts an illuminated beast and is related to his true form. (The full tattoo can be clearly seen on his [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/8642 Developer Insights].)</ref>

The Yakshas don {{w|Nuo opera|Nuo}} masks during battle,<ref name="yaksha trailer" /> although it is unclear if this is a trait shared by all yakshas or if it was exclusively used by the five foremost Yakshas. Notably, the symbols on their masks are cruder than, but still resemble, the elemental symbols of [[The Seven]].

===Powers and Abilities===
Because Xiao is the only yaksha left in modern times, it is unclear how many of his techniques were common to all yakshas and how many are his personal abilities. For example, Xiao's [[Elemental Burst]], [[Bane of All Evil]], is the time-honored "Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering" used to purge demons and divine karma.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Vision}}</ref><ref name="alatus1-3">{{Ref/Quest|The Purging of Evil}}</ref> Given that its Chinese name directly references {{Lang|Nuo|zh=傩}}<ref group="Note">In the Chinese version, Xiao's Elemental Burst is named {{Lang|mini=1|zh=靖妖傩舞|zh_tl=Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering}} and its description says this is the technique's name, which is corroborated by Xiao's [[Xiao/Lore#Vision|Vision story]] in both Chinese and English. However, the English version translates his Elemental Burst to make the term consistent with the way it was translated in his [[Xiao/Lore#Character Story 1|first Character Story]], where it is used as a title to describe Xiao's experience and expertise in slaying demons. The English description for Bane of All Evil was altered to reflect the term's use as a title.</ref> and that Yaksha Masks are based on Nuo masks, it is likely that "Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering" was a technique practiced by several yaksha, each with their own version.

As adepti, yakshas are capable of performing adepti arts such as Dream Trawler, used for self-cultivation,<ref name="alatus1-3" /> and Mortal Lingering.<ref name="alatus1-4">{{Ref/Quest|Insights of Drifting Dreams}}</ref> [[Bosacius]] uses his arts to seal his treasures in the region of [[Minlin]],<ref name="TYW">{{Ref/Quest|The Yaksha's Wish}}</ref> although it is unclear which parts of the puzzles in [[The Yaksha's Wish]] were created using his arts.

==Story==
===History===
Yakshas were illuminated beasts of "dreadful appearance and warlike temperament" who "spared no brutality" to perform their duty. For this reason, the Geo Archon, [[Morax]], called upon them to fight the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods after the [[Archon War]]. While there were many yakshas, five were considered the foremost yakshas for their strength and capability: [[Bosacius]], [[Indarias]], [[Bonanus]], [[Menogias]], and [[Alatus]]. Those five became known as the {{lang|"Five Yakshas"|zh=五夜叉}},<ref name="EotL" /> or simply {{Lang|"The Yakshas"|zh=仙众夜叉|zh_tl=The Yakshas of the [[Adepti]]}},<ref name="YTGA" /> with Bosacius, the eldest of them, as their leader.<ref name="EotL" />

Though strong, the yakshas were not all able to handle the darkness they faced. It's said that "some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul." Of the Five Yakshas, Bonanus, Indarias, and Menogias all perished, while Bosacius grew weary of battle and left his treasures in the region of [[Minlin]],<ref name="TYW" /> only to later succumb to his karmic debt and go mad.<ref name="EotL" /> During the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, monsters of the [[Abyss]] were sent by the people of [[Khaenri'ah]] to attack Teyvat, with [[The Chasm]] in Liyue as one of their targeted locations. Despite his insanity, Bosacius was drawn to the bloodshed and fought alongside the [[Millelith]] in defense of Liyue. Because he no longer remembered his own name, legends of the battle at The Chasm referred to him as the "Nameless Yaksha."<ref name="EotL" /><ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Tenacity of the Millelith}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Vermillion Hereafter}}</ref>

Now, only Alatus remains among all the yaksha.<ref name="YTGA" /><ref name="yaksha trailer" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|All things are impermanent, and to exist is to suffer. We yakshas have no need of sympathy or tears. My comrades who have passed on would see your tears as a stain on their legacy.|Xiao<ref name="alatus1-3" />}}
Amongst the adepti, the yakshas were greatly respected for their strength. Xiao holds a "high level of seniority"<ref name="XiaoDet">{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Character Details}}</ref> and other adepti refer to him by his title Conqueror of Demons out of respect,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Turning Point}}</ref> and some adepti like Ganyu even go to Xiao for training lessons. However, the task he has been entrusted with makes him keep his distance from even other adepti; [[Ganyu]] remarks that "all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us,"<ref>{{Ref/VO|Ganyu|About Xiao}}</ref> indicating he never worked closely with most non-yaksha adepti even in the past. His curt interactions with her are professional at best, leading her to find him somewhat unapproachable.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Illuminated Beast of the Sea of Clouds}}</ref> However, this is partially because he believes he is not a suitable mentor for her due to the bloodshed and karmic debt that accompanies him.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiao|About Ganyu}}</ref>

By contrast, Xiao appears to be fond of his fellow yakshas. He quickly grows reminiscent after [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] reveal that they met [[Pervases]], a long-dead yaksha who used the adeptus art Mortal Lingering to temporarily manifest in modern Liyue. He later decides to try [[Grilled Tiger Fish|Grilled Ticker Fish]], Pervases' favorite food, despite his usual distaste for mortal foods that aren't [[Almond Tofu]],<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiao|Favorite Food}}</ref> and repeats Pervases' catchphrase before getting caught up in his memories.<ref name="alatus1-4" />

The yakshas seem to have held a special bond with Morax. Xiao was freed from his enslavement to a cruel god when Morax defeated them and took him in as one of his own,<ref name="Xiao2">{{Ref/CS|Xiao|2}}</ref> leading to him to become fiercely defensive in matters related to the Archon.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiao|More About Xiao: IV}}</ref> The names "Xiao"<ref name="Xiao2" /> and "Pervases"<ref name="alatus1-4" /> were both personally bestowed upon them by Morax, suggesting that this may also be the case for all yakshas. [[Zhongli]], Morax's current mortal vessel, regularly prepares medicine for Xiao in hopes of alleviating the pain incurred by his karmic debt, and appears somewhat wistful over how diligently he holds to his duty.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|About Xiao}}</ref>

Amongst mortals, yakshas were once highly regarded as the protectors of Liyue. Large statues depicting them, such as those seen at [[Luhua Pool]], were erected across the nation, and people conducted rituals involving chants and food offerings to alleviate their pain and help them continue their mission.<ref name="OtWW">{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Ode to Windborne Wraith}}</ref> As their numbers dwindled over time, however, the Yakshas have faded into obscurity in the mortal realm.

Part of their obfuscation appears to be deliberate for the safety of mortals. [[Hu Tao]] states that stories about the miasmas and curses caused by fallen gods are seen as the stuff of legends nowadays, and if common people were to find out that they really existed, it would incite panic.<ref name="PCC1-2">{{Ref/Quest|In Pursuit of a Phantom}}</ref> Xiao avoids interacting with the mortal realm beyond his duties to purge demons, as his karmic debt can cause monsters in his vicinity to become stronger and more vicious.<ref name="alatus1-3" /> Simply being around him was enough to stain Paimon and the Traveler with his karmic debt, which allowed Pervases to identify him.<ref name="alatus1-4" /> Furthermore, unleashing his full strength to deal with the remnants of fallen gods is incredibly destructive, and any mortal in the vicinity would be "lucky" to survive the encounter.<ref name="XiaoDet" />

Over the ages, the yaksha statues have been damaged and have had their features almost completely destroyed.<ref name="OtWW" /> While books such as [[Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti]] and the "Ode to Windborne Wraith" chapter of "Tour of the Land of Liyue" exist to preserve knowledge about the yakshas, they appear to be rather unpopular due in large part to the archaic, wordy writing style of their authors, who are scholars at [[Sumeru Akademiya]].<ref name="alatus1-2">{{Ref/Quest|Glimmers of the Vigilant Yaksha}}</ref> For unspecified reasons, the "Ode to Windborne Wraith" chapter was among the chapters deemed "mystical and magical" for the Liyue edition and was cut from their version of the book.<ref name="OtWW" /> As a result, the yakshas have remained a subject of scholarly interest rather than something widely popular among the general public.

That said, the yakshas have not been completely forgotten. The [[Wangshu Inn]] at [[Dihua Marsh]] was established by the [[Liyue Qixing]]'s secret agents as a front for their true mission of assisting Xiao in his duty.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|3}}</ref> [[Chongyun]] and Hu Tao, due to their lineages, have greater knowledge of Liyue's history than most and have interacted with Xiao.<ref name="PCC1-2" /><ref group="Note">Chongyun's "About Xiao" [[Chongyun/Voice-Overs|Voice-Over]] implies he has directly spoken to Xiao before, and certain dialogue options in his first [[Hangout Event]], [[Signs of Evil]], reference Xiao.</ref><ref group="Note">Xiao's "About Hu Tao" [[Xiao/Voice-Overs|Voice-Over]] indicates he is familiar with her, while Hu Tao's [[Hu Tao/Voice-Overs|Voice-Over]] for him has her playfully feign ignorance, claiming "that kind of stuff is top-secret!"</ref> [[Starsnatcher]]'s grandfather, a folklorist, researched the yakshas in the past and imparted tales about them to his grandson, which led him to develop an interest in them himself.

Two of [[Yelan]]'s ancestors, [[Boyang]] and his younger brother [[Rongzhao]], fought alongside Bosacius at The Chasm. Boyang perished alongside Bosacius inside the mysterious domain, while his brother returned but went insane from karmic debt, only temporarily soothed by passing Wangshu Inn, where Xiao lives. The mysterious circumstances behind her family's past gave Yelan a great curiosity regarding what happened at The Chasm.<ref name="ATEL">{{Ref/Quest|At Tunnel's End, Light}}</ref>

==Trivia== 
* In the cinematic shown during [[Glimmers of the Vigilant Yaksha]], the elements for the other four of the five Guardian Yakshas were Pyro, Hydro, Electro, and Geo. The Electro Yaksha was stated to be Bosacius in ''[[At Tunnel's End, Light]]''.
** While not explicitly stated in-game, the identities of the Yakshas and their corresponding elements are confirmed by their voice actors; Indarias' and Menogias' Japanese VAs have stated that they voiced the 炎夜叉 (flame yaksha)<ref  name="indarias VA" group="Note" /> and the 岩夜叉 (rock yaksha)<ref name="menogias VA" group="Note" /> respectively. This leaves Bonanus as the Hydro Yaksha.

[[File:Location Cuijue Slope - Pillar Mask.png|thumb|The yaksha mask-like design found on the Nine Pillars]]

*The pillars seen at [[Cuijue Slope]], in their unbroken form, are adorned with what appears to be a yaksha mask. Approaching the mask and inlaying it with a [[Stone of Remembrance]] is a step in completing the World Quest [[Nine Pillars of Peace]], and causes both the mask and a portion of the pillar to shatter. However, the yakshas have not yet been explicitly mentioned in relation to the Cuijue Slope area, leaving this possible link a mystery.
*The Yakshas' masks are inspired by the masks worn in {{w|Nuo opera}} ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=傩|zh_rm=Nuó}}). Nuo operas contain many different aspects, including songs, dances, ceremonies, and sacrifices. These operas were performed to drive away demons, diseases, and evil influences, as well as petition for blessings from the gods.

===Etymology ===
*In Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist texts, the {{w|Yaksha|yakshas}} (feminine: {{w|Yakshini|yakshinis}}) are a broad class of nature spirits who are often worshipped as guardian deities. They serve {{w|Kubera}}, the god of wealth and prosperity; in some Buddhist beliefs, he is known as {{w|Vaiśravaṇa}}, the god of war. Both of these epithets are ascribed to [[Morax]].
* Of the Five Yakshas, only Alatus has any clear connection to a mythological yaksha: {{w|Garuda}} (also known as Suparna), the golden-winged eagle who is also the basis for the Chinese Buddhist mythological figure {{w|Golden Winged Great Peng}}.
*The other four Yakshas' names have no discernable basis and seem to use original names; the English localization opted to {{w|Latinisation of names|Latinize}} their Chinese names to fit in with the decision to translate Xiao's title, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=金鹏|zh_rm=Jīnpéng|zh_tl=Golden Peng}}, as the Latin word {{Lang|mini=1|la={{wt|alatus|Alatus|Latin}},|la_tl=Winged.}}<ref group="Note" name="YakshaNames" />
**{{Lang|Bosacius|zh={{wt|浮||Chinese}}{{wt|舍||Chinese}}|zh_rm=Fúshě<!--|zh_tl=Abandoning excess-->}} uses the Latin masculine suffix {{Lang|mini=1|la=''{{wt|-aceus|-acius|Latin}}''}}.
**{{Lang|Indarias|zh={{wt|應|应|Chinese}}{{wt|達|达|Chinese}}|zh_rm=Yìngdá<!--|zh_tl=[One who has] arrived at the answer-->}} uses the Latin feminine suffix {{Lang|mini=1|la=''{{wt|-arias||Latin}}''}}.
**{{Lang|Bonanus|zh={{wt|伐||Chinese}}{{wt|難|难|Chinese}}|zh_rm=Fánàn<!--|zh_tl=Suppressing danger-->}} uses the Latin masculine suffix {{Lang|mini=1|la=''{{wt|-anus||Latin}}''}}.
**{{Lang|Menogias|zh={{wt|彌|弥|Chinese}}{{wt|怒||Chinese}}|zh_rm=Mínù<!--|zh_tl=Overflowing/everlasting fury/vigor-->}} uses the Latin feminine suffix {{Lang|mini=1|la={{wt|-ius|-ias|Latin}}}}.
* All of the Five Yakshas' titles make some kind of reference to an animal in the original Chinese text:
**Bosacius' title, {{lang|mini=1|zh=腾蛇太元帅|zh_tl=Marshal Téngshé|zh_lit=General Soaring Snake}}, refers to the {{lang|{{w|Teng (mythology)|Téngshé}}|zh=腾蛇}}, a flying dragon in Chinese mythology.
***His English title, Marshal Vritras, is derived from the {{w|Vritra}}, a Vedic serpent that personifies drought, evil, and chaos.
**Indarias' title, {{lang|mini=1|zh=火鼠大将|zh_tl=General Fire Rat}}, refers to the mythological {{w|fire rat}}, a large rat from the southern volcanoes whose fur is fire-repellant.
***Her English title, General Musatas, is derived from the Latin word {{Wt|mus|''mus''|Latin}}{{Wt|-atus|''atus''|Latin}}, meaning "mouse-like".
**In Bonanus' title, {{lang|mini=1|zh=螺卷大将|zh_lit=General Curled Snail}}, the character {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|螺}}}} refers to any aquatic snail. Her English title's derivation is unclear.
**Menogias' title, {{lang|mini=1|zh=心猿大将|zh_tl=General Xīnyuán|zh_lit=General Mind-Monkey}}, is derived from the Buddhist term {{w|monkey mind}}, used to describe someone who is capricious, restless, and cannot be contained. It is often associated with, and embodied by, the mythological figure {{w|Sun Wukong}}.
***His English title, General Kapisas, is derived from {{Lang|sa={{wt|कपीश}}|sa_lit=Monkey God|sa_rm=Kapīśa|mini=1}}, one of the names of the Hindu god {{W|Hanuman}}.
