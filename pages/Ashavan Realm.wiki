===Etymology===
* {{Lang|''{{w|Ashavan}}''|ae=𐬀𐬴𐬀𐬬𐬀𐬥}} is a Zoroastrian term for "possessing/mastering truth" or "possessing/mastering righteousness." It can also be a combination of two Sanskrit words, ''Asha'' meaning "hope or life" and ''Van'' meaning "forest." ''Ashavan'' means "hopeful forest or forest with life."
* In the Chinese name for Ashavan Realm, the term {{zh|s=善见|t=善見|rm=Shànjiàn}} is the Chinese translation of {{Lang|{{w|Sudarshana Chakra|''Sudarshana''}}|sa=सुदर्शन}}, which is derived from two Sanskrit words &mdash; {{Lang|''Su''|sa=सु}} meaning "good/auspicious" and {{Lang|''Darshana''|sa=दर्शन}} meaning "vision."
