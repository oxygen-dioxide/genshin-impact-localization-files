==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{Lang|''{{w|Ashavan}}''|ae=𐬀𐬴𐬀𐬬𐬀𐬥}} is a Zoroastrian term for "possessing/mastering truth" or "possessing/mastering righteousness". It can also be a combination of two Sanskrit words, ''Asha'' meaning "hope or life" and ''Van'' meaning "forest". ''Ashavan'' means "hopeful forest or forest with life", which is more relevant from Sumeru's perspective as compared to the word of Zoroastrian origin.
* In the Chinese name for Ashavan Realm, the term {{zh|善见|rm=Shànjiàn}} is the Chinese translation of {{lang|{{w|Sudarshana Chakra|''Sudarshana''}}|sa=सुदर्शन}}, which is derived from two Sanskrit words – {{lang|''Su''|sa=सु}} meaning "good/auspicious" and {{lang|''Darshana''|sa=दर्शन}} meaning "vision".
