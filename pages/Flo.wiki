==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Flo:''' I wonder &mdash; what sorts of clothes are in fashion over in the city of Fontaine? Hmm? Are you wearing the latest and greatest, by any chance?
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;I doubt so...
::'''Flo:''' Huh. I do think that the clothes you're wearing do have a designer feel to them, though...
::'''Flo:''' I've never seen their like before. In fact, I thought that they were some new fashion of a sort... Ah, I'd love to try something like that on.
::{{DIcon}} You love fashionable outfits, don't you?
::'''Flo:''' Sure do!
::'''Flo:''' Lovely clothes with their own sense of style can sometimes even give their wearers confidence in their beauty. It's a wonderful thing.
::'''Flo:''' People who are able to design such clothes are awesome. I, too, really love sewing and design work.
::'''Flo:''' Sometimes, when I see the beautiful clothes worn by people in the city of Fontaine, I think, "Ah, if only I could put something similar on!"
::{{DIcon}} Can Melusines wear human clothes, though...
::'''Flo:''' Well, of course not. Our bodies are very different &mdash; even beautiful clothes made for children wouldn't make good direct fits for us...
::'''Flo:''' But whether we be human or Melusine, our feelings toward lovely clothes are one and the same, and so I wish to create such clothes that Melusines, too, can wear!
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'' and before completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Flo:''' Hmm. Was it just me, or was everything shaking a bit just now?
::'''Flo:''' Oh dear... [[Virda]] said that she'd be going out to train. Will she be alright?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Flo:''' Sure. Please tell me about any beautiful clothes you know of next time we meet, alright?
{{Dialogue End}}
===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Ancient Colors''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Flo:''' Ah, I heard about what happened from Virda. Thank you for saving her!
:'''Flo:''' Sorry for the trouble my little sister caused you. I'll remind her to stay safe in the future...
:'''Flo:''' Oh dear. How could I ever thank you?&nbsp;... Oh, I know! Why don't I help you design a set of clothes?
:'''Flo:''' Really, though, I'm only any good at sewing... So how would tights do? I've heard that the thieves and heroes in those stories all love wearing them...
:{{DIcon}} I think I'll pass on the tights...
::'''Flo:''' Ah, so you don't like them? Well, if you find clothes that you do like, please, tell me.
::'''Flo:''' I can imitate even the most fashionable outfits perfectly as long as I have something to model my work after. I'm quite confident in my work in this regard!
::{{DIcon}} You love fashionable outfits, don't you?
:;(Dialogue continues same as above)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Virda...
::'''Flo:''' She's not injured &mdash; thanks to you, of course.
::'''Flo:''' She seems to have gotten all excited about having been able to help out, though. *sigh* I have to wonder if she heard a word I said about staying safe...
:{{DIcon}} See you...
::'''Flo:''' Alright. Next time we meet, if you want any nice-looking clothes, you can come to me to get its design worked out...
