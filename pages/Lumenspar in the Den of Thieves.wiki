==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing this Hidden Exploration Objective awards the {{Achievement|Den of Thieves}}.

==Trivia==
* Accessing the den of thieves through illegitimate means (e.g., {{w|Glossary of video game terms#clipping|wall clipping}}), instead of through the trapdoor under the tent, results in an otherwise invisible ''Prospecting Thieves (Continued)'' quest completion message appearing, but no rewards are given for it.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/bedVMfz454E Completing a Quest That Does Not Exist in Genshin Impact]</ref>
