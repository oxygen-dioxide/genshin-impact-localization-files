{{Quote|Cardinal Calvin has been taking care of various matters since the departure of [[Seamus Pegg|my father]] and Grand Master [[Varka]]. He's so busy that he seldom ever leaves his room. Even the other sisters in the Church rarely ever see him.|[[Barbara]]}}
'''Cardinal Calvin''' is the cardinal and de facto Seneschal of the [[Church of Favonius]]. The Seneschal of the Church of Favonius, [[Seamus|Seamus Pegg]], prior to his departure with Varka on an expedition, entrusted and turned in all of his duties and responsibilities to Cardinal Calvin. This has left the replacement Cardinal swamped with work. According to Barbara, the last time she's seen him in person was when the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]] was stolen, distraught by its disappearance.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sister Victoria's Vexation}}</ref>
