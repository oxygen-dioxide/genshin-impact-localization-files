'''''They Who Hear the Sea''''' is a World Quest that occurs in [[Twinning Isle/1.6|Twinning Isle]], [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]]. It was part of the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event.

==Steps==
# The quest starts after interacting with the Echoing Conch, [[Echoing Tales/Story|The Clan of Song, Scattered]], located slightly west of the [[Teleport Waypoint]] at Twinning Isle.
# Search for treasure on Twinning Isle
#*Dig the area where the hilichurl is at.
# Unlock the treasure chest

==Gameplay Notes==
*The lock's code is '''5'''-'''2'''-'''1'''-'''4''', corresponding with the first word in each of the stanzas of the poem recited in the conches of 'Songs of a Distant Home': Five Mountains, Two Paths, One River and Four Winds.
*The option to dig for the chest does not appear until the quest has been triggered.
*The player needs to check the [[Conch Retrospection]] in the Event menu screen at least once. Otherwise, the chest will not unlock even if the correct code is entered.
**The code will work even if the player did not collect all the relevant conches, as long as the criteria above is fulfilled.
*The chest is guaranteed to contain a 4* [[Berserker's Bone Goblet]]. The stats are random.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You discover a strange conch shell on Twinning Isle in the Golden Apple Archipelago. The sounds that come from within seem to hint at something...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Interact with the conch)
:'''Echoing Conch:''' "The tides are getting higher by the year. If the water level rises much further, we will stand very little chance of survival..."
:'''Echoing Conch:''' "There's no other choice. I must tell everyone to pack up their belongings and move to higher ground."
:'''Echoing Conch:''' "Mother!"
:'''Echoing Conch:''' "What's wrong?"
:'''Echoing Conch:''' "The tide reached us, so I told everyone to run and get to higher ground. But the family heirloom &mdash; I'm sorry... It was a choice between that and getting everyone to safety, so I... I didn't have enough time to get it."
:'''Echoing Conch:''' "It's right in {{Color|buzzword|the center of the island}}. If the water recedes sometime, or if someone gets in from outside, we'll just have to get them to find it for us."

;(After digging up the chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Found it! Treasure, treasure... Wonder what'll we find inside...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? There's a lock on it. And it's coded, too... Looks like we'll need the code to open it...
:{{DIcon}} We can just shatter it, can't we?
::'''Paimon:''' Wait! What will happen if the stuff inside breaks as well?
::'''Paimon:''' Let's find a way to unlock it instead, shall we?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like we'll have to find a way to unlock it.
::'''Paimon:''' But Paimon doesn't see any stone tablets, portraits, notes, carvings or notes nearby...
::{{DIcon}} There's a dearth of scholars, Treasure Hoarders, and adventurers, too.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. Hmm... This is an unprecedented test!
:'''Paimon:''' But since this chest contains "family heirlooms" and is locked using a code...
:'''Paimon:''' That's gotta mean that the person who locked it thinks that the code they left behind is easy enough to remember.
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like our only chance are those conches that store sounds.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's listen to the sounds inside those conches again. Let's hope that they can give us some clues about the code...

;(Upon interacting with the chest)
:'''Locked Chest:''' (You must enter the correct code to open this chest. What number do you wish to enter in the first position?)
:{{DIcon}} Enter "1"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "2"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "3"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "4"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "5"
:'''Locked Chest:''' (You must enter the correct code to open this chest. What number do you wish to enter in the second position?)
:{{DIcon}} Enter "1"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "2"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "3"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "4"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "5"
:'''Locked Chest:''' (You must enter the correct code to open this chest. What number do you wish to enter in the third position?)
:{{DIcon}} Enter "1"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "2"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "3"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "4"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "5"
:'''Locked Chest:''' (You must enter the correct code to open this chest. What number do you wish to enter in the fourth position?)
:{{DIcon}} Enter "1"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "2"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "3"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "4"
:{{DIcon}} Enter "5"

;(If the correct code was entered)
:'''Paimon:''' It opened! Let's have a look at what's inside!

;(If the wrong code was entered)
:'''Paimon:''' Aw, it didn't open... Looks like we didn't enter the correct code...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's listen carefully to the sounds that the conches make. Maybe those'll give us some clues.
