:'''[[Renaud]]:''' If I'm to be honest, you're a lot sturdier than I imagined...
:'''[[Rodamonte]]:''' Assess as you wish. I don't care.
:'''Renaud:''' ...Your rationality is most admirable, too. It is something I lack. But I can't help but worry about you &mdash; it must be hard, being unable to speak to those around you.
:'''Rodamonte:''' I do not wish for their understanding. This is the price of keeping a secret.
:'''Rodamonte:''' Also, are you done beating around the bush? Let's get to the meat of the matter. I'm busy.
:'''Renaud:''' The meat of the matter... Um...
:'''Renaud:''' So, uh, have you found anything else lately?
:'''Rodamonte:''' You want it all?
:'''Renaud:''' Well, of course I'd like to see them, too. I mean, I trust your decision-making, right?
:'''Rodamonte:''' How did this become my decision? The key is your view. What do you say?
:'''Renaud:''' Um, what should I say...
