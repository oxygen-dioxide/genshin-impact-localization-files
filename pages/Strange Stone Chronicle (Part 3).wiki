{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Chesil's area two in-game days later)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers that the gem merchant said that he would use the rocks to make some kind of new accessories...
:'''Paimon:''' How far along is he with that, though?
:'''Paimon:''' If we have time, let's go back and check!

;(Talk to Chesil)
:'''Chesil:''' Ah, it's you two, the ones who sold me those gemstones...
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! You said something about turning them into pretty accessories the last time we met... How's that going?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't wait to see how they turned out!
:'''Chesil:''' About that... I'm afraid I must disappoint you.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh?
:'''Chesil:''' I really wanted to inlay the gemstones in jewelry, but the ore is far too hard to polish by hand in any detail...
:'''Chesil:''' And that's not even the worst part. Who could have imagined that after being cut and polished, the ore would lose all its original glow?
:'''Chesil:''' Either way, they're not suitable for crafting at all.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... Paimon didn't expect things to turn out like this. We genuinely thought that these stones would be useful in some way...
:'''Chesil:''' Useful, you say... Well, it certainly isn't useless...
:{{Black Screen|Chesil places a mechanical clock on the counter while speaking.}}
:'''Chesil:''' Look at this new mechanical clock &mdash; it was made using that very ore.
:'''Chesil:''' I was about to blame myself for misjudging the ore and was going to just get rid of it...
:'''Chesil:''' But then some clocksmiths came by and saw the scraps left over from our processing attempts. Since the ore was so durable, they took some with them and used it to make components for their clocks.
:'''Chesil:''' I was surprised to discover that thanks to the ore's high resistance to abrasion, it is superior to materials traditionally used for the moving components of clocks.
:'''Chesil:''' But if they're used to make clocks, the supply shipments would need to be even more reliable...
:{{DIcon}} I guess we can do that...
:{{DIcon}} If you contact Puca directly...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Chesil about Puca and the ore veins.}}
:'''Chesil:''' I see. then that is truly a happy coincidence! The prototype clock was created using the latest waterproof clam-style design &mdash; in other words, it was intended for Melusine use from the very start!
:'''Chesil:''' In that case, could you bring this prototype to Miss Puca and explain the situation to her?
:'''Chesil:''' After all, I've never done business with Melusines before... If Miss Puca could provide us with a stable supply, we'd be able to establish a whole new production line.
:'''Chesil:''' I'll be sure to personally visit her in the future! Hmm... it would be a good idea to implement Melusine aesthetics into future clock designs...
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, sounds like it'll benefit Puca too if you succeeded!
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, this could be a great opportunity for Puca to start her own gemstone factory! C'mon, let's go talk to her!
:'''Chesil:''' I'm counting on you!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Special Clock}})

;(Talk to Chesil again, optional)
:'''Chesil:''' If Miss Puca can provide a steady supply of ore, then perhaps we'll be able to mass produce these clocks.
:'''Chesil:''' Anyway, I'm counting on you!

;(Talk to Puca)
:'''Puca:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, it's been a while!
:'''Puca:''' Are you looking for the same strange rocks as last time?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, we are, but there's something else too...
:{{Black Screen|You give Chesil's prototype clock to Puca and tell her about Chesil's plan to make clocks using the strange ore.}}
:[[File:Item Special Clock.png|100px]]
:'''Puca:''' A&mdash;Amazing! They can make things like these out of those rocks!?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Only the bits inside are made from that stone...
:'''Puca:''' You can even hear it ticking underwater... I've never seen a clock like this!
:'''Paimon:''' Chesil talked about it having an oyster-style structure... Or was it clam-style?
:'''Puca:''' Hehe, I'm happy just hearing the sound coming from the clock!
:'''Puca:''' I never imagined that even ordinary stones like this would be so suited for something...
:'''Puca:''' I always thought that you had to be like my [[Sluasi|sister]], and only the rarest of gemstones could be turned into treasures. I never thought that you could also make something incredible with such ordinary rocks...
:{{DIcon}} Everything has its value and purpose.
:'''Puca:''' Mm-hmm, I suddenly feel really good about myself!
:{{Black Screen|Puca carefully places the clock in a nice place.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, now all you have to do is get the ore ready and sell it to Chesil when he needs it!
:'''Paimon:''' Then, you'll even be able to have your own gemstone workshop, just like your sister!
:'''Paimon:''' You've collected lots of different stones, after all. Maybe you'll be able to find a use for each and every one of them!
:'''Puca:''' Right! I'll definitely make preparations for that! Thank you so much!
:'''Puca:''' If you ever need any rocks, come find me anytime!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, don't mention it!
