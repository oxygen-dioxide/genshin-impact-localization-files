==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Affan for the first two times)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} The Golden Roses have sprouted into seedlings, yes.
:'''Affan:''' These seeds... Where did you even find these seeds, I wonder?
:{{DIcon}} From a far-off place.
:'''Affan:''' Did you indeed? Well, I suppose that the seeds Uncle Shafaqat sowed really did find their way back here in the end after being spread to every corner of the desert &mdash; even if the path they took meandered quite a bit.
:'''Affan:''' We'll have to take good care of these seedlings &mdash; I intend to leave them to young Sabbah. Once I, too, am gone, these flowers shall pass on to her.
:'''Affan:''' Thank you, child. There is little I can give you... but please accept these fruits and flowers.

:'''Affan:''' You've truly helped this old man out, and you asked for no reward &mdash; but ah, I would have trouble sleeping tonight if I didn't give you a little something at least.
:'''Affan:''' This seedling recently broke through the soil, and Sabbah suggested giving it to you. She even wrapped it up nicely.
:'''Affan:''' Take it as a memento from us. May you be as resilient as this seedling, and may you always keep the faith.
