# Defeat the Hilichurls

==Request Details==
===Request from Yinjie===
{{Quest Description|The hilichurls are causing trouble...}}
Help Needed:<br>
One of the good things about doing business here at {{Color|buzzword|Caravan Ribat}} is that things aren't as risky as they are out there in the desert.<br>
However, we still sometimes encounter harassing {{Color|buzzword|hilichurl}} bands who sometimes take up residence in our cargo storage by force.<br>
I mean, how are honest businesspeople supposed to do a job like this? Please help us restore order and normalcy.
