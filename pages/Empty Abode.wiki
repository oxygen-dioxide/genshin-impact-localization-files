;(While approaching Stormterror's Lair)
:{{A|vo mdaq067 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like this is the front gate to {{Color|buzzword|Stormterror's Lair}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq067 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The gate is enormous compared to us... But still, Paimon wonders how Dvalin gets in there with a body that huge?
:{{A|vo mdaq067 1 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' He doesn't walk in, he flies in.
:{{A|vo mdaq067 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Oh. Hmm, you do have a point.
:;(At the entrance)
:{{A|vo mdaq067 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's stuck.
:{{A|vo mdaq067 2 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It's stuck.
:{{A|vo mdaq067 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, check out that {{Color|buzzword|roof}}. Is there a giant {{Color|buzzword|hole}} in it?
:{{A|vo mdaq067 2 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hmm... I suppose we could make use of that {{Color|buzzword|wind current}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq067 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's make a detour then. Heading up!
:{{A|vo mdaq067 2 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Let's make a detour then. Heading up!
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Do you think there will be Abyss Mages hiding in the ruins?
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Either way, if we do run into one, we will let the victorious Master Diluc do the&mdash;
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Do not underestimate them just because I have beaten one of them before.
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I'm not boasting. I'm simply saying there is more to the Abyss Order than a few mages.
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Correct. That's why I tagged along, after all.
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Well, that &mdash; and also for your safety.
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, why am I so diligent? Too diligent for a poet, in fact!
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So says the person that made zero effort to search for the dragon tears and drank in the tavern all day!
:{{A|vo mdaq066 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't get it, what part of you is remotely diligent?
:;(When approaching the wind current)
:{{A|vo mdaq067 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look! A {{Color|buzzword|wind current}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq067 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It might lead us to the top of the tower.

;(At the top of Stormterror's Lair)
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh, we can't advance any further. The ruins seem to be guarded by ancient {{Color|buzzword|seals}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this the work of Dvalin?
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' No. These ruins were once part of an ancient city. Dvalin just happens to be nesting in these ruins for now.
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' These ruins even predate the existence of The Four Winds.
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Mondstadt is a city without a ruler. However, before it was,
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It was ruled over by a tyrant.
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Anyway... I'll sing you that story when we have a chance [[Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land (Quest)|in the future]].
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' The markings on this seal... If my archaeological knowledge is not mistaken, this appears to be a {{Color|buzzword|light actuator}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' If we retrieve and {{Color|buzzword|reintegrate}} all the {{Color|buzzword|parts}}, we should be able to {{Color|buzzword|get it working}}.
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' We should be close to completing the ceremony for this actuator.
:{{A|vo mdaq067b 1 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Let's put the {{Color|buzzword|last part}} back and see.
