|description = Some say fate hides in the wind, like the fragrance of flowers, like rain and dew...<br />Such is the law of nature, absolute and insurmountable.<br />Others, on the other hand, strive to seek out their own destinies, or even go as far as to reweave the threads of fate.<br />But at the end of it all, is this not an orchestration of fate?
