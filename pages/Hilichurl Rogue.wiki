{{Description|Hilichurl wanderers unaffiliated to any specific tribe or group. They can often be found roving the wilds.<br>Sometimes, they may also lend their aid to other hilichurls for a variety of reasons.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

'''Hilichurl Rogues''' are an enemy group and part of the [[Hilichurls|Hilichurl]] family and are found in [[Liyue]], [[Sumeru]], [[Fontaine]], and [[Natlan]]. Wanderers seeking a bygone splendor that once belonged to their people, these hilichurls live solitary lives, though they will occasionally help smaller groups of hilichurls before resuming their journey and are said to be more intelligent than the common hilichurl.

In combat, Hilichurl Rogues deal Elemental DMG, and will sometimes summon slimes of their corresponding element and use them to attack the player. Destroying these slimes will knock the rogue down for a few seconds.
