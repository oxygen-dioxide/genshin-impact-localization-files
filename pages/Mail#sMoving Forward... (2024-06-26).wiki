|text      = This morning, I received some desserts from [[Yae Miko|Miko]]. She told me she's going to "stir things up" on her birthday and told me to "seize this opportunity too."

Though I... am not particularly interested in any lively occasions myself.

The fleeting "moments" spent together shall gradually make up an irreplaceable "eternity." Thus, the significance of celebrating one's birthday lies in creating new memories with their cherished ones.

Let us meet at Hanamizaka, then. We can share about our experiences since we last met and witness how Inazuma continues to move forward, ushering in a new age, moment by moment.

...However, I find myself perplexed. What's the difference between [[Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk]] and [[Dango Milk|regular Dango Milk]]?
