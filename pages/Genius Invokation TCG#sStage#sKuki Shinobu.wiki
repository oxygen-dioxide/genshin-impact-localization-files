;(Talk to Kuki Shinobu)
:{{A|vo card shinobu invite easy 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Sure, I'll play. I've dabbled a bit in this kind of game before, so I know a trick or two.

;(When the player defeats one of Kuki Shinobu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card shinobu ingame easy 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Nice play.

;(When the player defeats two of Kuki Shinobu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card shinobu ingame easy 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' This is turning into quite the predicament.

;(When Kuki Shinobu defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card shinobu ingame easy 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' You've gotta stay calm, you know...

;(When Kuki Shinobu uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo card shinobu ingame easy 04.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Now it's my turn.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card shinobu invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Seems like I've still got a ways to go before mastering this game.

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card shinobu invite easy 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Hmm... if there were official tournaments or organizations for this game, then I suppose I could try my hand at becoming a certified TCG player.

===Serious Showdown===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kuki Shinobu)
:{{A|vo card shinobu invite hard 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' No problem. I've played quite a few matches with other members of the Arataki Gang, but none of them are any good... Let's see how good you are.

:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...

;(When the player defeats one of Kuki Shinobu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card shinobu ingame hard 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' I'll give you credit for that one.

;(When the player defeats two of Kuki Shinobu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card shinobu ingame hard 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' What an absolute mess...

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card shinobu invite hard 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Not bad at all. Got any interest in becoming Boss' TCG coach? Just the other day, he swore that he'd put some serious effort into getting better at the game.

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card shinobu invite hard 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' ...Don't mention a word of this to Boss. The moment he finds out, he'll proclaim me the "Genius Invokation TCG Champion of the Arataki Gang," and drag me off to all sorts of places to play on his behalf.

===Guest Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kuki Shinobu)
:{{A|vo card shinobu freetalk 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Boss is quite fond of this game, too. When he first started playing, he'd look for people to duel every day, boasting about his skills all the while. But then he got around to playing a few rounds with me... Don't think he's been nearly as cocky since.

::{{A|vo card shinobu leave 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Take care. I'll be heading out soon, too. Hmm... now what kinds of souvenirs should I get before I leave?

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card shinobu endofgame win 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' This kind of game isn't that hard to play once you figure out the fundamental logic behind it.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card shinobu endofgame fail 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' You know what they say &mdash; practice makes perfect. I think I'll need to find some more time to practice my decks.
