|description     = A traditional Sumeru dessert.
|desc_suspicious = The sickly sweetness explodes in your mouth like a bomb, leaving your teeth rattling in the wake of its saccharine shockwave. The appropriate amount of sweetness lifts the spirits, but too much of it becomes a terrible burden.
|desc_basic      = This puff pastry contains chopped nuts and has been baked after having butter drizzled atop it &mdash; and not forgetting some syrup once it comes out of the oven. Some researchers will specially order this veritable "fortress of sweetness" to replenish their energies before an exam. This is also why this dish has great pride of place as the Akademiya's favorite dessert.
|desc_delicious  = A certain researcher once said that the people of Sumeru can be split into two categories. Those who eat desserts to live, and those who live to eat desserts. The thin puff pastry layers of this dish, and the bone-piercing aroma of butter and honey, may yet consign all who taste it into the second camp.
