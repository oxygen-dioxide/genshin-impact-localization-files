'''Sacrificial Offering''' is a [[World Quest]] in [[Inazuma]]. It is the second part of the [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] questline.

==Steps==
# Go to the abandoned shrine northeast of [[Konda Village]]
# Carry out the investigation at the abandoned shrine
#*''(Optional)'' Interact with the large [[Sky Kitsune Statue]] to the east.
#* Interact with any [[Mysterious Shadow]].
# Continue the investigation at the abandoned shrine (Mysterious Shadow locations in [[Sacrificial Offering#Gallery|Gallery]])<!-- does this step technically ever show up if you never talk to the Sky Kitsune Statue and just go straight to sending the Mysterious Shadows to the kitsune statues? -->
#* Talk to the three [[Mysterious Shadow]]s twice until they teleport to the three kitsune statues surrounding a small stone platform.
#* The first shadow is in front of a small shrine near the entrance to the area. She will teleport to a kitsune statue along the road.
#* The second shadow is in front of the main shrine with the [[Electroculus]]. She will teleport to the Sky Kitsune Statue located southeast of the platform with the three kitsune statues.
#* The third shadow is on the roof of the shrine. She will teleport to the trees south of the main shrine, passing the platform with the three kitsune statues.
#* Once all three shadows are at the platform, they will vanish and spawn 3 [[Exquisite Chest]]s.
#* Investigate the platform to obtain [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary]].
# Head to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] to investigate
#* Talk to [[Inagi Hotomi]] to obtain [[Memento Lens]].
# Return to the abandoned shrine and use the Memento Lens to investigate
#* Observe the [[Earth Kitsune Statue]]s using the lens to witness several scenes featuring the masked miko and an old man, the previous rite's worker. Three of the scenes feature the required lines; the other scenes are optional to watch:
#** At the {{w|hokora}} (little shrine) near the torii.
#** To the right (when facing it) of the main shrine.
#** Next to the Sky Kitsune statue.
#** Near the three Kitsune statues where you got the chests.
#** Further to the east of the main shrine.
#** South of the three Kitsunes, near where the Mysterious Shadow was in the trees.
# Recite the sacred words in front of the Sky Kitsune Statue
# Obtain the [[Ward (Sacrificial Offering)|ward]]
# Find the barrier
#* The barrier is in a cave north of a small lake located south of Grand Narukami Shrine.
#* There are two entrances to the cave:
#:* One entrance has a locked gate, with an [[Electroculus]] behind it. It requires a [[Rust-Worn Key]], which can be found on top of a table under the well in Konda Village.
#:* The second can be found to the west of the locked gate. It has [[Electro Crystalfly|Electro Crystalflies]] flying near the entrance.
# Destroy the barrier
#* The puzzle is solved similarly to the [[A Strange Story in Konda#Puzzle|previous quest]]. Adjust the Electro lanterns with the corresponding number of petals to form the pattern given by the shrine emblem. Adjust the central lantern to "2", and the other 3 lanterns to "3".
#* Defeat the [[Ochimusha|Mysterious Samurai]].
# Talk to [[Hanachirusato]]

==Notes==
*The first line of the sacred words is "In the name of Narukami's envoy." The second line is "And of the Hakushin bloodline." The third is "Bring forth the fried tofu!"
*After obtaining the Memento Lens, it is possible to complete the ritual at Araumi and at the Kamisato Estate before completing this quest, even though the two are formally required for the next quest, Cleansing Defilement. If the rituals are completed early, the step towards completing Cleansing Defilement will start at ''Complete the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual (2/3)''.

==Dialogue==
{{StubDialogue|Investigate the Abandoned Shrine: figure out conditions for triggering Paimon's dialogue after speaking to Mysterious Shadows (based on location? looping? number of times??<br /><br />Any early part: Is there dialogue if you go straight to the Thunder Sakura root via the crystalfly tunnel before discovering the 3 sacred lines?}}
===Investigate the Abandoned Shrine===
{{Quest Description|According to [[Hanachirusato]], these barriers must be broken to cleanse the [[Thunder Sakura]]'s roots. The next barrier seems to be located in the abandoned shrine to the northeast of Konda Village. Although the place sounds quite unsetting indeed, this is Hanachirusato's request, so it is best that you see it done.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon approaching the abandoned shrine at Mt. Yougou)
:'''Paimon:''' This must be the abandoned temple that the masked shrine maiden talked about!
:'''Paimon:''' ...It definitely looks abandoned.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, time to search the area for clues!
;(Talk to Mysterious Shadow)
:'''Mysterious Shadow:''' ...
:;(If first or second encounter){{Verify}}<!-- someone put this line for the first instance, but this line can definitely be obtained in the second instance without getting it in the first instance, too -->
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? She vanished... How?
:;(If third or fourth encounter){{Verify}}
::'''Paimon:''' Gone again... Ohh, Paimon's getting spooked now...
:;(If fourth or fifth encounter){{Verify}}
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm. Seems like there's some {{Color|buzz|pattern}} to her disappearances.
::'''Paimon:''' We should {{Color|buzz|observe}} carefully... And by "we," Paimon means you!

;(If the large [[Sky Kitsune Statue]] statue is approached)
:'''Paimon:''' A fox statue... Yup, it's the same as the one in Konda Village!
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon doesn't see a ward in it... or has the ward been hidden?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, it's some troublesome {{Color|buzzword|secret}} again, isn't it...
:{{DIcon}} We're a pretty good combination...
::'''Paimon:''' Hehehe, right? The village chief told us everything.
:{{DIcon}} I sure hope that isn't the case...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait! There's some writing here.
:'''Paimon:''' {{Color|buzzword|"The ward has been sealed within by sacred words."}}
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, what does that mean? There's some more writing here as well...
:'''Paimon:''' "Although I hope the seal will never be broken, and although you have now been missing for many years... If the seal must be broken and the Cleansing Ritual conducted, I hope that you shall be the one to break it."
:'''Paimon:''' "The third line of the sacred words is something you often used to say in the past."
:{{DIcon}} I don't get it.
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything else?
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see... "But if the one to undo the seal is my successor, then there is one extra step you must go through."
:'''Paimon:''' "There are four great spirits, and three spokes in the Mitsudomoe. I have placed {{Color|buzzword|three shikigami}} here as guardians. {{Color|buzzword|Only when they are all gathered here in one place}} can you proceed."
:'''Paimon:''' "I wouldn't call this layer of security all that useful, but it should still serve to fend off some petty thieves."
:'''Paimon:''' ...Eh!?
:{{DIcon}} What is it, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Then we have to find a solution!
:'''Paimon:''' Otherwise, we'd be no better than "petty thieves"!

;(Examine Sky Kitsune Statue)
:'''Records:''' "The ward has been sealed in place using {{Color|buzzword|sacred words}}. There are four great spirits, and three spokes in the Mitsudomoe. I have placed {{Color|buzzword|three shikigami}} here as guardians. {{Color|buzzword|Only when they are all gathered here in one place}} can one proceed."

;(Talk to the three [[Mysterious Shadow]]s until they teleport to the three kitsune statues surrounding a small stone platform.)

;(Investigate the spot after 3 Exquisite Chests appear)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that should do it! Phew, Paimon's exhausted!
:{{DIcon}} Shouldn't I be the exhausted one...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's not fuss over the details, shall we?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, looks like there's a book in here...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, it's so hard to read!
;(Obtain [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary]])
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's read it all, but it also feels like Paimon didn't read anything at all.
:'''Paimon:''' Forget it. Let's get some professional help!
:'''Paimon:''' Since it's about gods and demons and stuff, let's go to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]], shall we?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Grand Narukami Shrine===
{{Quest Description|update|Although you have obtained the ancient and esoteric text, you seem to need the aid of certain sacred words to unseal the Sky Kitsune Statue and obtain the Ward. This is likely to be the realm of the clergy &mdash; perhaps you might find some help at the Grand Narukami Shrine.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Head to the Grand Narukami Shrine and talk to [[Inagi Hotomi]])
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Hello, Traveler from afar. Welcome to the Grand Narukami Shrine!
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' If you have some trouble or just want to make a wish, feel free to ask [[Gendou Ringo|Ms. Gendou]] for a [[Fortune Slip|fortune slip]]. May the [[Electro Archon]] bless you.

:'''You explain the situation with the abandoned shrine at the foot of the mountain'''

:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' I see. I understand the situation.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' The [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] is a very important rite, and there are indeed records of it...
:{{DIcon}} But?
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' But the actual details of the ritual have been lost. The {{not a typo|Summary}} you are holding is a very valuable historical artifact in that regard.
:{{DIcon}} Lost?
:'''Paimon:''' Are the [[Fatui]] behind this? If you say it's so important, then they might be up to something here too...
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Oh no. The degradation here is due to poor preservation, humidity, and moths.
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Ah, it's a great shame, but a lot of historical records have been lost. [[Lady Yae]] and [[Kamisato Ayato|Sir Kamisato]] were fretting over this earlier as well.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' But as for the sacred words, I do know a thing or two.
:'''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm! Please tell us how to unseal that ward!
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' I apologize, but the sacred words used to seal the ward are not some sort of specific formula.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' ... Instead, they are something created by the one who casts the seal themselves.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What do you mean...
:'''Paimon:''' The spell... was created on the fly by the caster?
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' This is not precisely so, either. Sacred words of this sort do have some rules.
:{{DIcon}} Do elaborate.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Hmm... I believe that the records go something like this.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' The first line represents one's own status in Inazuma. Something with the word "envoy" attached to it, I believe...
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' The second line is meant to explain the source of one's power. Something like dango, ramen, or a light novel, for example.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon gets it. Those are definitely great power sources!
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' I'm just giving an example. The records use something like "Onmyou Hakkyou."
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' As for the third line...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Is it something you can just make up?
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Yes, you've guessed it. It can be whatever you want it to be.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Considering how long it's been, I doubt that any still live who understand how to use this third line.
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, what shall we do, then?
:'''Paimon:''' Miss Masked Maiden's commission... and this whole nation... it's all gonna go kaput!
:{{DIcon}} Relax, Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} She isn't done talking yet...
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Mm. Perhaps these two items can be of aid to you.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' This is the {{Color|buzz|Memento Lens}}.
:'''Paimon:''' Memento? So it's a souvenir?
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Since the two of you are so knowledgeable, I trust that you must have heard of the [[Kamera]]? It's a [[Fontaine]]-made device that can record images.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' A long time ago, when [[Ritou]] was first founded, the [[Hiiragi Clan]] leader [[Hiiragi Hiroshi|Hiroshi]] imported many new inventions from other places to prove the benefits of building a trading hub.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' For example, he used a [[Snezhnaya]]n blast furnace to turn an old Hiiragi Clan mansion at [[Tenshukaku]] into a hot spring, before sending it as a gift and token of appreciation to Her Excellency.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' He also used the demon-exorcising mirror gifted to the Hiiragi Clan by the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] to create a special Kamera in Fontaine. It can record thoughts and memories. It was returned to us here at the Shrine as a token of appreciation and friendship.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' As the years passed, the Kamera itself ceased to function. Only the lens blessed by the Kitsune Saiguu can still see things that no longer exist in certain special places.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' We extracted the lens and named it the Memento Lens.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' The two of you have come on account of the "sakura," and I can sense from our conversation that you are trustworthy.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' I believe that it will come to good use in your hands.
:{{DIcon}} Such an important item...
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' I suppose you may not be familiar with this as outsiders, but we believe that everything has a soul. Even stones and trees have memories! And when an item is left unused for a long time, it will grow bitter with dissatisfaction.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' As such, we might as well give the Lens to someone who can show it all the changes the world has gone through rather than letting it gather dust in our shrine.
:'''Paimon:''' No problem! Leave it to us!
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Legend has it that after the Kitsune Saiguu disappeared, her familiars, the [[Earth Kitsune|{{Color|buzz|Earth Kitsune}}]] of Narukami Island, turned into sleeping statues in many places, waiting for her to return.
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' If you see a small, strange-looking fox statue, looking at it through the {{Color|buzz|Memento Lens}} may reveal something new.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to us!
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' May the Electro Archon bless you! I shall be counting on you two, then.
;(Obtain [[Memento Lens]])

;(Talk to Inagi Hotomi again)
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' The use of sacred words was said to have become a lost art after the Kamuna bloodline failed...
:'''Inagi Hotomi:''' ...Ah, sorry, I didn't see you there. The Memento Lens is yours to keep. Take it out to see the world, would you?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Return to the Abandoned Shrine===
{{Quest Description|update|Inagi of the Grand Narukami Shrine told you about the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, and you also obtained a rather powerful Memento Lens, which can be used to view Earth Kitsune Statues and thus see images of the past. Use this small gadget to find the correct sacred words and obtain the Ward from the Sky Kitsune Statue.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue at the hokora (little shrine) near the torii.)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''[[Kamuna Harunosuke|Mysterious Man]]:''' Hmm. Yes, it looks like the spirit veins here can still be used.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Her familiars are also here. Yes, it is a fine place.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Well then, allow me to use sacred words to protect this ward.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Then the first line shall be {{Color|buzzword|"In the name of Narukami's envoy."}}
;(After scene disappears and if this is '''not''' your third/last sacred phrase found.)
:'''Paimon:''' This Memento Lens really is convenient!
:'''Paimon:''' The first line reads {{Color|buzzword|"In the name of Narukami's envoy"...}}. Looks like we're in luck!

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue under the gazebo near the torii.)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' Then let us part ways here.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Ah, you're so cold.
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' "Rosy-cheeked in the morning, bleached bones by dusk."
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Oh, come on! It was at least half an emotional reunion for me! Actually, maybe it was more like one quarter?
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Ah, you're gone already? Come on...

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue to the right (when facing it) of the main shrine.)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''Mysterious Man:''' ...Guess I'll just follow the previous example and use "And of the [[Hakushin Clan|Hakushin bloodline]]." as the second line. I am no master onmyouji, after all.
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' You are... that person who seems very nice on the surface.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Hey, long time no see. Guess you're still so cold to me, huh...
:'''Mysterious Man:''' ...Wait, no. Who are you?
:'''Mysterious Man:''' This scent... Is it time for the Cleansing Ritual again?
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' I am... Call me "Hanachirusato."
:'''Mysterious Man:''' ...No need to tell me. I get it.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' I thought she had returned for a moment there... Huh, so that's what happened.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Yeah, don't worry about it. Nice to meet you, Miss Hanachirusato!
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' I... I remember now. About the Sacred Sakura. About you. About Raiden.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Mm-hmm. Ah, wait. Perhaps what you're seeing right now is not me, but [[Ioroi]] in disguise.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' After all, Miss Hanachirusato, you've never seen me in person before, right?
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' I'm not sure there would be much difference either way, if my memory serves.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Eh? Come on, that was uncalled for...
;(After scene disappears and if this is '''not''' your third/last sacred phrase found.)
:'''Paimon:''' "Hanachirusato"? This name...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, it doesn't matter. The second line reads {{Color|buzzword|"And of the Hakushin bloodline"}}.

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue further to the east of the main shrine.)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''Mysterious Man:''' ... Yeah, it's decided. We'll let her go this time.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' After all, it's not my job, and it's not as if she is some monster, charging at me like an [[Ochimusha]] might.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' I'm all tuckered out already. I thought I had run into a long-lost friend. That feeling is so exhausting...

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue in front of the [[Sky Kitsune Statue]].)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' How quickly the shrine has fallen to neglect after losing its master and the incense within...
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' I can only hope that the barrier within the cavern still stands strong.
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' Ah, I remember now. She once instructed people to {{Color|buzzword|construct a locked gate}} by a canal on the road leading to [[Chinju Forest]], before giving the key to the Konda Clan.
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' I hope everything is still alright.
;(After scene disappears)
:'''Paimon:''' {{Color|buzzword|A locked door}}? Konda village? Paimon remembers we found a {{Color|buzzword|key}} at the bottom of that well...

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue to the left of the Sky Kitsune Statue.)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''Mysterious Man:''' That being said, after she left, [[Ioroi]] seems to have led his tribe to wreak havoc everywhere.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Well, I could have kept one eye shut, had Ioroi stayed in the [[Chinju Forest]].
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Mm. Guess he needs to be taught a good lesson...

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue near the three Kitsune statues where the three chests spawned.)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' This was... my previous...
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' Wait, that wasn't me. It was her previous territory.
:'''Mysterious Woman:''' That person over there... seems so familiar...

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue south of the three Kitsunes, near where the Mysterious Shadow was in the trees.)
:'''Through the Memento Lens, you see something that wasn't there...'''
:'''Mysterious Man:''' My, that lady is such a buzzkill.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' If I am to have a disciple one day, I shall find a cheerful and beautiful lady. Yeah, I'll make sure of that.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Now, as for the third line... Ah, right, this looks good.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' {{Color|buzzword|"Bring forth the fried tofu"}}!
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Since this is her territory &mdash; the land of the Hakushin bloodline &mdash; we'll go with that.
;(After scene disappears and if this is '''not''' your third/last sacred phrase found.)
:'''Paimon:''' {{Color|buzzword|"Bring forth the fried tofu"}}!
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh! This person's got good taste!

;(Investigate the Earth Kitsune Statue southwest of the three Kitsunes, near the lake with the [[Cryo Abyss Mage]])
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Yeah, guess we're done here. Time to write all this down and hand it over to the shrine.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' After all, this isn't like the shikigami paper I use. With any luck, they'll preserve it properly. Things might get dicey if these document come across moths or water.
:'''Mysterious Man:''' Ah! Silly me, saying such inauspicious things...

;(Once all three sacred phrases are discovered)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we should have the right sacred words now, right? Let's give them a try!

;(Investigate the Sky Kitsune Statue)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! It's time to unlock the seal! The first line is...
:{{DIcon}} "In the name of Narukami's envoy."
:{{DIcon}} "And of the Hakushin bloodline."
:{{DIcon}} "Bring forth the fried tofu!"
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, was that right? Well, whatever. Paimon remembers that the second line should be...
:{{DIcon}} "In the name of Narukami's envoy."
:{{DIcon}} "And of the Hakushin bloodline."
:{{DIcon}} "Bring forth the fried tofu!"
:'''Paimon:''' The third line should be something about delicious food...
:{{DIcon}} "In the name of Narukami's envoy."
:{{DIcon}} "And of the Hakushin bloodline."
:{{DIcon}} "Bring forth the fried tofu!"
;(If the player chose the wrong order)
::'''Paimon:''' No reaction... seems the order was wrong. (Traveler), keep trying!
;(If the player chose the correct order)
::'''Paimon:''' That's right, fried tofu! It was delicious fried tofu!
::'''Paimon:''' That should do the trick!
;(Obtain the [[Ward (Sacrificial Offering)|Ward]])
{{Dialogue end}}

===Find and Destroy the Barrier===
{{Quest Description|update|You have the ward. the next thing to do now is to dispel the barrier associated with it.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Find the barrier)
:'''Paimon:''' Look! This branch is just like the one we saw earlier!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like this is the barrier. Hehe, it's not gonna stop us now!

;(Solve the puzzle and defeat the [[Ochimusha]])
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like there's one here too! Just as expected...

;(Talk to Hanachirusato)
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Again, the two of you have my thanks.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa!
:{{DIcon}} This again, eh...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I apologize. There are some things that become... a habit, perhaps.
:'''Paimon:''' Why are you following us again? Couldn't you just say hello?
:{{DIcon}} Don't say that...
:{{DIcon}} She must have her reasons...
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, um, sorry. Paimon's tired from floating around too much... Paimon didn't mean to be rude.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' It is alright. The barrier here has been undone successfully, and thus does the Cleansing Ritual come a step closer to completion. Thank you very much.
:'''Paimon:''' What's the deal with the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, anyway? Is it the same as the "cleansing" you asked us to do earlier?
:{{DIcon}} Miss Inagi also mentioned this before...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Inagi? Is Miss Inagi a shrine maiden named [[Inagi Misato|Misato]], by any chance?
::'''Paimon:''' Her name is [[Inagi Hotomi|Hotomi]], Paimon thinks.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Ah, that's right. It has been such a long time...
::'''Paimon:''' But she also said that the method has been lost.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Ah. Hmm... Well, it has been so long, after all...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' It is understandable. I mean, so much time has passed. Don't worry, I'm not angry. Yes, it's just my memory throwing a tantrum.
::'''Paimon:''' Miss Masked Maiden does seem to be very angry, actually...
:{{DIcon}} So, we found this book called the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary...
::'''Paimon:''' Which Paimon didn't understand at all!
::'''Hanachirusato:''' People can't read it nowadays? But it was written in the common tongue...
::'''Paimon:''' "People nowadays"? Hey, just how old are you?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Wha&mdash; H&mdash;Hey, that's very rude of you!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...Anyway, the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is a rite of purification.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Thunder Sakura of Narukami Island can absorb the filth within the earth. But over time, that filth will accumulate.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' If too much filth accumulates, the Thunder Sakura may wither.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Therefore, it is necessary to perform some "minor purifications" on the roots of Thunder Sakura scattered in five places around Narukami Island every once in a while, and to set a barrier up. This way, they are given the power to remove the accumulated filth.
:{{DIcon}} What about the Cleansing Ritual, then?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' When there is enough filth accumulated in the barrier, it becomes necessary to perform the Cleansing Ritual.
:'''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm, Paimon gets it! So, when performing the Cleansing Ritual, we'll need to use a ward to break the barrier over the tree roots.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' This is an excellent understanding of the situation.
:'''Paimon:''' Of course! We've done it twice now, after all.
:{{DIcon}} So, those monsters that looked like samurai were...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' So, is that how they present themselves nowadays...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' They are the embodiment of the land's defilement. Once driven out of the roots by the ward, they will condense into a physical form.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Back then... Uh, I mean, according to past records, they would turn into kasha, inugami, black jades, umibouzu, raging flames, and other such things. And not all of them would harm people, either. For example, there were the tofu boys...
:'''Paimon:''' Kasha? Tofu boys? What in the world are those?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Oh, people don't know about these creatures nowadays?
:{{DIcon}} ?
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' But now, they have all turned into ferocious ochimusha... What has happened to Inazuma?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Uh, so, what if the cleansing rituals aren't performed and the trees do wither?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' As I recall... I mean, the records say that the Thunder Sakura almost withered several hundred years ago.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Monsters raged unchecked then. Even the seas turned black. The Thunder Sakura tried their hardest to absorb all the evil and the filth, and they almost died in the process.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} What happened then?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The things that came after... I'm really sorry, but I'm not too familiar with them.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Either way, the present situation tells me that the problem was resolved in the end. Someone performed the Cleansing Ritual.
:{{DIcon}} You mentioned that there are five places...
:{{DIcon}} Where should we go next?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Thanks to your efforts, two root barriers have been undone. Next...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Having done and seen so much, the two of you must be tired and hungry. I have prepared some dishes. I hope you will like them...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, it looks delicious! You might be wearing a mask, but you're the best shrine maiden in Inazuma for sure!
:{{DIcon}} Hooray for the best shrine maiden in the land!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's real hungry, eh?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Well then, please enjoy yourself...

:'''You dig into a delicious-looking feast with Paimon...'''

:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, this is great!
:{{DIcon}} Is it really?
:{{DIcon}} It seems just a little bit off...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, now that Paimon thinks about it, we just ate so much, but it feels like we've eaten nothing at all.
:'''Paimon:''' Miss Masked Maiden, did you...
:{{DIcon}} ...Poison the food?
::'''Hanachirusato:''' How could you suggest that I would do such a thing?
:{{DIcon}} ...Use magic?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' You seem very sensitive to things of a mystical nature.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Regardless, please don't worry. These dishes were made with magic I secretly learned from the [[Bake-Danuki|bake-danuki]]. They are absolutely harmless. Generally speaking.
:{{DIcon}} "Generally speaking"?
:{{DIcon}} So why...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The reason I have served you such suspicious... Well, delicious food, is to help heal the remaining roots.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The Chinju Forest is also home to a ward and a root that requires cleansing. And I believe that an old friend of mine still dwells deep within that forest.
:{{DIcon}} "You believe"?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' It was a very long time ago. I'm afraid that I'm not entirely sure if he remembers me. Or if he might hate me.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' He can't move freely, and he can't communicate with people, either. But after eating this, you should be able to communicate with him.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That old friend of mine should be able to help you at least a little. So I did this, for the sake of the Cleansing Ritual.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The two of you have already twice demonstrated your honor, compassion, and skill.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Surely, you will finish this deed for the sake of this land's well-being, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Since Miss Masked Maiden says we have to, let's finish this fight!
:{{DIcon}} Are you two teaming up to tease me?
:{{DIcon}} You're too easily led, Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! How could you say that?
:{{DIcon}} What about the other roots?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Apart from Chinju Forest, there is a tree root at a place called [[Araumi]].
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I wonder if there are still people living there. I haven't been there for a long time.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' The last one... is outside the [[Kamisato Estate|Kamisato residence]]. There is a pit on a beach northeast of there, and the root is within.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I leave the Cleansing Ritual to you...
:{{DIcon}} Wait a moment.
:{{DIcon}} I have another question.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Please go ahead.
:'''Paimon:''' Back there in the abandoned shrine, Miss Masked Maiden, we saw someone who looked just like you through the Memento Lens...
:'''Paimon:''' Her name was "Hanachirusato." Are you that Hanachirusato?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Indeed I am.
:'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;Has Paimon been cheated?
:{{DIcon}} She said so in the beginning, you know...
:{{DIcon}} You're the only one who's been calling her "Miss Masked Maiden"...
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Well, anyway, what was that all about?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I'm sorry. I never meant to hide anything from you. I've just never had a chance to explain.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Nor is now the right time either. I'm really sorry.
:'''Paimon:''' Well... Fine, Paimon gets it.
:'''Paimon:''' Just let us know once you've got the chance, Miss Masked Maiden.
:'''Paimon:''' Right? (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} You're right.
:{{DIcon}} I'm still quite concerned...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Thank you very much.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Ah yes. One other thing. When you spoke of the "Memento Lens" earlier, what were you referring to...

:'''You recount Inagi Hotomi's explanation...'''

:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...Th&mdash;That mirror, Hiroshi... He...
:{{DIcon}} Wh&mdash;What happened?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' ...*sigh*
:'''Hanachirusato:''' I lost my composure. Please forgive me. In that case, please keep this "Memento Lens" safe. It is a very precious instrument indeed.
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;I understand...
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep it safe, trust me.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Please do! It is very precious!
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I'll be sure to look after it well...
:'''Hanachirusato:''' There are small fox statues in many different places. They are called Earth Kitsune. With the Memento Lens, one can summon forth scenes from the past at those statues' locations.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' If it can be of aid in your adventures, please make good use of the Memento Lens.
:'''Paimon:''' We'll use it well!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Please do, and protect it! Don't bump it against things, and remember to clean it regularly!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, got it!
:'''Hanachirusato:''' That's good. Now then, if you'll excuse me, I must go.
:{{DIcon}} How will we meet up?
:'''Hanachirusato:''' "If the crimson sakura knows the pain of parting, it will forever stay."
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Our fates shall surely be entwined like those of the Sakura Bloom.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Till our next meeting, I will be praying for your success beneath the well in Konda Village, where you successfully purified the Thunder Sakura root. I wish you all the best.

;(Go to the Konda Village well and talk to Hanachirusato again)<section begin="Hanachirusato talk again dialogue" />
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Ah. We meet again.
:'''Hanachirusato:''' Although it is a pity that we are unable to meet where the sun shines for now, the light from the Thunder Sakura, which symbolizes the divine, and the light from your aura are enough to illuminate this space. If there is anything I can help you with, please let me know.
:{{DIcon}} About the other barriers...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Apart from Chinju Forest, there is a barrier in a place called Araumi.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' Finally, there is a pit on a beach northeast of the Kamisato residence's courtyard. That is where you will find the final barrier.
:{{DIcon}} I couldn't find the ward...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' In the past, the ward was guarded by the Sky Kitsune. But after everything changed, the Sky and Earth Kitsune eventually refused to show up, instead sleeping and waiting for her return.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' If you want to find the ward, look for the Sky Kitsune around the seal... that should be a special fox statue. If you're having difficulties, try to find the Earth Kitsune nearby, or use that Lens to see if there are any clues.
:{{DIcon}} About the Memento Lens...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' I'm afraid I don't know much more about this than you. Apart from the Hiiragi Clan's squandering of their divine gift, that is...
::'''Hanachirusato:''' There are many sleeping Earth Kitsune in Narukami Island. What you may see before you, though, is most likely to be a small, special fox statue.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' In the past, though they were weak in strength, they valued loyalty. If you look at them through the Memento Lens, you should be able to see some scenes from the past.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hanachirusato:''' "Our hearts drift with the clouds{{sic|....|hide=1}}"
::'''Hanachirusato:''' If there is anything I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know.

==Trivia==
* After destroying the barrier, Hanachirusato recites the following ''{{w|waka}}'': "Rosy-cheeked in the morning, bleached bones by dusk." {{Lang|ja=朝に紅顔ありて、夕べに白骨となる。}} This is from No. 794 of {{w|Wakan rōeishū|''Wakan Rōeishū''}} by Fujiwara no Kintō.
** The poem refers to human aging and the transience of human life. This is appropriate since the Mysterious Man is most likely an aged Kamuna Harunosuke returning as an old man to carry out the Sacred Sakura Cleansing ritual on the now-deceased [[Kitsune Saiguu]]'s behalf. When Saiguu was still alive, she remembered him as an "easygoing young man who went to Liyue to practice the Adepti arts," which may have been developed into the Kamuna Arts used by [[Kairagi]] to ignite or electrify their swords, despite lacking Visions.
* The Mysterious Man is [[Kamuna Harunosuke]], while the Mysterious Woman is Hanachirusato. The scenes revealed by the Memento Lens took place some time after the [[cataclysm]] (the "dark disaster") five hundred years ago, during which the Kitsune Saiguu perished and her shrine was abandoned.
** Despite sharing Hanachirusato's character model, the Mysterious Shadows are not depicting her &mdash; they are "Shikigami," or minor spirits, summoned by Kamuna to protect the Ward after he finished using them to perform a minor cleansing on the Sakura Sakuras sometime after the cataclysm.
