==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Tighnari has a gold earring on his right ear that is intricately carved in the shape of three dangling leaves.

Tighnari's outfit consists of a cropped dark blue hoodie with black strings, yellow trim, and red and green details. A large yellow flower adorns his right side, and then a silver badge with a green tassel on his left side. The left sleeve of his hoodie is short, decorated with a singular green leaf, and stops just above his elbow, while the right sleeve is tight and reaches until his wrists. The right of his hoodie also has a long piece of pleated white fabric with a colorful pattern that stretches down until his upper thigh. On both wrists, Tighnari wears large black cuffs, gold trinkets, and a pair of black and orange gloves.

Under this, Tighnari wears a long white tunic with a thick purple belt with numerous blue and purple ropes and other multicolored trinkets attached, along with a large purple pocket on one side and two round pins where his Dendro [[Vision]] hangs. He wears a pair of ankle-length black pants with a pleated dark blue and red overcoat, cuffs, and laced white and blue boots with green stripes. Tighnari also sports a green half-cape attached to a large gold trinket on his back.
