:'''Gracie:''' Whether you wish to go to the opera house or the Fountain of Lucine, please head southward along this road.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the opera house...
::'''Gracie:''' The most magnificent building on Erinnyes is the [[Opera Epiclese]]. When we Fontainians speak of the "opera house," that's what we're normally referring to.
::'''Gracie:''' It has another, more important role, besides serving as a site for various cultural performances.
::'''Gracie:''' It is also a courtroom in which all cases in Fontaine are judged.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Fountain of Lucine...
::'''Gracie:''' That is where all the waters in our land gather, and so it is the most popular site for wishes.
::'''Gracie:''' Couples who wish for children go there, believing that the spirits in the water will bless them with healthy and happy children.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
::'''Gracie:''' You're welcome.
