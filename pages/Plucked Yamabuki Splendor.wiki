'''Plucked Yamabuki Splendor''' is [[Chiori]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
Chiori wears a golden-and-black kimono-inspired dress over a grey sleeveless top. A red obi sits around her waist, with bows at the front and a large, flower-shaped knot tied at the back. Her {{Geo}} [[Vision]] is worn like an obidome on a purple obijime. A three-petaled flower design is common on her attire and many of her accessories, including her stud earrings. She wears elbow-length dark gloves and dark stockings. Her dark brown hair is styled into an ornate flower-shaped bun with a curled side ponytail, held together by kanzashi hairpins, a bow, and as well as Japanese thread scissors. She wears black cantilevered heels with red straps and black ankle straps adorned with a bow.

Kirara wears a brown cat-ear like accessory decorated with gold and flowers and lined with blue fabric and white fur. Along with this, her hair is styled a number of yellow and brown hairpins, as well as one flower-shaped clip on the right of her hair. Kirara has a distinct set of two-toned cat tails.

Kirara's outfit consists of a dark colored cropped top made up of two pieces of fabric and decorated in the middle with a large yellow ornament with a jingle bell and two yellow tassels. Over this, she wears a patterned light blue tunic with detached sleeves decorated around the arms with white fur and long dark fingerless gloves that stretch past her elbow. 

Around her waist, Kirara wears a stylized black belt consisting of a long piece of black fabric held together with numerous bows of varying colors with a dangling ornament pinned to it and a small blue cape decorated with flowers. Under all of this, she wears a pleated blue skirt lined with gold and a set of black leg warmers.
