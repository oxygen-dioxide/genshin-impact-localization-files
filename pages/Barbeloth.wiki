'''Astromancer Barbeloth Trismegistus''',<ref name="Hunters" /><ref name="Astromancer" group="Note" /> also known by her codename '''"B,"''' is a master hydromancer, visionary, and teacher to [[Mona]]. She is also a member of the [[Hexenzirkel]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}</ref>

==Profile==
The name "Megistus" (meaning "great") is a suffixal identifier and functional surname of mages under Barbeloth's tutelage.<ref name="Hunters" /> Barbeloth was already once known as Barbeloth Megistus, but renamed herself "Trismegistus" (meaning "thrice as great") to distinguish herself from her students. According to Mona, Barbeloth is a visionary;<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hunters, Prophets|quote='''Mona''': What I can tell you is that I'm an astrologist, and that this prophecy concerns the fate of Fontaine, even that of all Teyvat. Ascertaining this is akin to reading the fortune of the whole world. I'm afraid that this is not something that just anyone can do. If I could do it, you would no longer call me an astrologist... but a visionary. [...] The old hag could do it, and I'd bet there are others amongst those Hexenzirkel colleagues of hers who could do something similar.}}</ref> someone so skilled at astrology that she can read the fortunes of entire nations, [[Teyvat]] and the world itself. Mona's greatest wish is to overtake Barbeloth in hydromancy and become known as the world's greatest astrologer.

Barbeloth is also the friend and rival of [[Alice]],<ref name="ABF">{{Ref/Quest|A Bewildering Fate}}</ref> a famous adventurer and powerful mage. She is only talented in astrology, whilst Alice is well-versed in a variety of magical fields.

Though Barbeloth initially did not understand what Alice saw in [[Andersdotter]], she later grew to respect her and realized that her acuity for the world's operating principles could sometimes surpass that of astrology.<ref>[[Imaginarium Theater/Fortune Slips|Imaginarium Theater Fortune Slip]]: ''I must confess that I did not initially understand what Alice saw in you...''</ref>

==Story==
Fifty years before the game's start, Barbeloth made a pact with Alice, which resulted in Alice taking possession of Barbeloth's diary. The diary has since been entrusted to [[Klee]] and was accidentally read by Mona.<ref name="ABF" />

At some point in the past, Barbeloth was involved with the creation of [[Simulanka]] alongside Alice and [[Andersdotter]], and became its Goddess of Prophecy.<ref name="UEW" />

===Etymology===
* "Barbeloth" may stem from the Gnostic aeon {{w|Barbelo|Barbēlō}}, a supreme, androgynous entity in Gnosticism known as God's first thought, being His "feminine aspect" and the Mother-Father of the aeons.
** Barbēlō is also called "Barbeloth" in many historic texts and is thought to be a corruption of the original name.
* "Trismegistus" is derived from {{Lang|{{w|Hermes Trismegistus}}|grc=Ἑρμῆς ὁ Τρισμέγιστος|grc_tl=Hermes the Thrice-Greatest}}, a legendary figure associated with the Greek god {{w|Hermes}} and the Egyptian god {{w|Thoth}} and considered the father of Egyptian alchemy.
