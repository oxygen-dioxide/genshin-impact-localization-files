==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|According to the clues you've found, none of the owners of the four sets of footprints were the criminal who stole [[Sir Arthur]]. As you painstakingly search for answers, it seems yet another issue has arisen at the newspaper...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach The Steambird)
:'''[[Jenck]]:''' What do we do now, Euphrasie? The letter says that this is the second threat now!
:'''Euphrasie:''' What do you mean, second? Where was the first one?
:;("Curve," Talochard, Paimon, and the Traveler approach)
:'''Paimon:''' Euphrasie! We're here!
:'''Euphrasie:''' Just the people I wanted to see. Did you find anything useful?
:'''Talochard:''' We discovered that Sir Arthur was stolen by a woman who calls herself "Crow or Blackbird?". She seems to have a grudge against you.
:'''Paimon:''' She left a threatening letter at the scene. Someone took it, but we retrieved it.
:'''Euphrasie:''' What? There really was an initial threat? May I take a look?
::'''Mysterious Threat Letter'''
::To The Steambird.
::Mosso's death 30 years ago is still on my mind. Whenever I think of your paper's rhetoric, which intentionally passes off falsehoods as truth, I simply cannot suppress my indignation. As such, I have taken Sir Arthur captive.
::I eagerly await your paper's sincere repentance. Issue a public apology and surrender Mosso's legacy.
::Should you continue to spin a web of lies that obfuscates the truth, I will be left with no choice but to slay that Steambird.
::Crow or Blackbird?
:'''Euphrasie:''' What!? This... Could it be...
:'''Talochard:''' What do you remember, Euphrasie?
:'''Euphrasie:''' ...Please take a look at this first. We received a second threat this morning. The sender... seemed very agitated.
:;(Opens Another Mysterious Threat Letter)
::'''Another Mysterious Threat Letter'''
::Outrageously, it would seem that your paper hasn't a shred of remorse.
::Having not yet caught the attention of the authorities, I made good on my promise by dismembering Sir Arthur and burying him in a field. Buried with him are your paper's evil deeds from 30 years ago.
::Furthermore, I have spread the word &mdash; treasure maps or "clues to Dr. Mosso's base" shall surely make the treasure hunters come flocking, no?
::Soon, your misdeeds shall come to light, alongside that bird's remains.
::Crow or Blackbird?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, Sir Arthur...
:'''Euphrasie:''' Sir Arthur shouldn't have to suffer... We never received the first letter...
:'''Paimon:''' It's all Baulard's fault!
:'''Euphrasie:''' I just received news that they're organizing treasure-hunting groups. They're probably after Dr. Mosso's base...
:'''Talochard:''' But they're only going to find the dismembered Sir Arthur, and the... unspeakable things... that the paper did, I guess?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Agent Talochard, I know that the Marechaussee Phantom has a file on the case, but believe me, there are things that even you don't know.
:'''Talochard:''' Do you know who sent the letter?
:'''Euphrasie:''' If I were to guess... it would be Melo Lombroso, Dr. Mosso's granddaughter.
:'''Paimon:''' Granddaughter? So, it's a relative, coming back for revenge?
:'''Talochard:''' Hmm. Then it would seem that "Crow or Blackbird?" is a question from her.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Question?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Everyone, time is of the essence right now. Regardless of the authenticity of what's written in those letters, the reputation of the paper will be tarnished if they are published.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Will you please retrieve those things for us? In the meantime, I will contact Melo immediately.
:'''Talochard:''' In that case, I have a request, too. Euphrasie, you know about the clues to Dr. Mosso's base, yes?
:'''Euphrasie:''' You... want that? I mean, I do know something, but I can't guarantee that it will help your cause.
:'''Euphrasie:''' I can promise that I will tell you everything I know after this is over. It might answer some of your questions. Will that work?
:'''Talochard:''' Sounds good to me. Any questions?
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready to go.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, Paimon has a question! There are three locations on the map, but where are we going first?
:'''Talochard:''' If we don't have time, why don't we split up? Curve and I will go to one location, and Paimon and {{Traveler}} will go to another. Whoever finishes first will go to the last place.
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like we don't have a choice.
:;(Adds "Another Threatening Letter" to the Case Record)
::'''Another Threatening Letter'''
::The second letter signed "Crow or Blackbird?" used to threaten The Steambird, but without Baulard, it proved successful this time.

;(Approach the marked location at [[Fort Charybdis Ruins]])
:'''Kevin:''' Come on, Baulande! You can do it!
:'''Paimon:''' Kevin! What are you doing here?
:'''Kevin:''' Paimon, {{Traveler}}! Are you here to look for Sir Arthur and the treasures?
:'''Paimon:''' If Kevin knows, that means everyone knows.
:'''Kevin:''' Well, I'm not here for the treasures. I just want to send Sir Arthur back!
:{{DIcon}} Does your mother know?
:'''Kevin:''' Yes, she came with me, but we split up. Oh, and I have to thank both of you!
:'''Kevin:''' After you left the other day, I thought about it for a long time, then I went to look for my mom and we talked about a lot of things.
:'''Paimon:''' So you and your mom made up. Paimon was wondering why you were so polite today. Hehe, good for you!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's look for Sir Arthur, quick!
:'''Kevin:''' I think it must have been hidden somewhere tricky. It usually doesn't take Baulande very long to find something.
:'''Baulande:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Paimon:''' This dog looks familiar... {{Traveler}}, isn't this Rocher's puppy?
:{{DIcon}} It does look a little like that one.
:{{DIcon}} All dogs look the same.
:'''Kevin:''' Rocher? My mother gave me this dog, and I called it Baulande... I mean, that's actually my father's name, and I was mad at him at the time...
:'''Kevin:''' I got into a fight with my mom previously, and I... wound up venting my anger on the dog and kicking him out. Good thing I found him again today, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, so... are you Baulande or Lombroso?
:'''Baulande? Lombroso?:''' (The puppy wags its tail excitedly, as if saying, "I don't understand!")
:'''Paimon:''' Agh! Whatever the case, we just need to find Sir Arthur as soon as possible... We're at the location marked on the map, but where could that bird be?
:'''Kevin:''' If only whoever hid it had left something behind. Baulande has an amazing nose, and can find things quickly after sniffing.
:'''Paimon:''' Right, {{Traveler}}! Look into your bag to see if there's anything we can use.

;(Talk to Kevin again, optional)
:'''Kevin:''' {{Traveler}}, do you have anything that Baulande can sniff at?

;(Talk to Baulande? Lombroso?)
:'''Baulande? Lombroso?:''' (The puppy looks at you, as if waiting for something.)
:;(Opens [[Talochard's Investigation Notes]])
:'''Give potentially useful items to Baulande? Lombroso? To have a sniff.'''

;(Submit an incorrect item)
:'''Paimon:''' This isn't it, right?

;(Submit Threatening Letter or Another Threatening Letter)
:'''Baulande? Lombroso?:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Kevin:''' Wow, you got it! Baulande must have found something.
:'''Baulande? Lombroso?:''' (The puppy wags its tail excitedly, as if saying, "It's in there!")
:'''Paimon:''' Is it in the hole? But the entrance is too small. How do we get in?
:{{DIcon}} You can do it, Paimon.
:'''Kevin:''' I can do it! Let me do it! I don't want her pretty clothes to get dirty.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't let you do that! What if there's something scary inside?
:'''Kevin:''' I'm a problem kid, so I'm not scared of anything! Just wait, I'll be right out!
:{{Black Screen|Kevin swiftly climbs into the hole, and drags out a chest just as quickly.}}
:'''Kevin:''' I found it! It really is inside!
:'''Paimon:''' You've changed a lot, Kevin. You're helping other people with their problems!
:'''Kevin:''' Thank you, heh. Let's see what's inside the chest!
:;(A [[Common Chest]] appears)

;(Open the chest)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Sir Arthur's Wing}})
:'''Paimon:''' Sir Arthur's wing!
:'''Kevin:''' Oh no, Sir Arthur's been dismembered... Don't worry! We'll put you back together!
:'''Paimon:''' I think this is it. Let's go to the next location. We have to get there before the others!
----
;(Approach the three fighting men)
:'''Kevin:''' Oh no! Someone got here before us! And they're fighting over the treasure!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... What are those guys doing here!? Let's start with getting them to stop...

;(After [[Boss (The Red and the Black)|Boss]] is defeated)
:'''Boss:''' Stop! I surrender! Ahaha... Well, what a coincidence! Are you here for the treasure, too?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Why are you all here? Don't you believe me?
:'''Paimon:''' Valberry! We're here to look for Sir Arthur. Are you here for the treasure?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Ha! I knew this dirty dog would come for the treasure if he heard about the news. And I got him!
:'''Rocher:''' Um, agents... May I have the chest? I'm looking for Sir Arthur, and if I can return it to the newspaper, I might just be able to get a job...
:'''Rocher:''' Then I can make some money and buy my wife's things back...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Bah! How pathetic! Rocher, you really think that's why your wife left you, huh? She left because you're such a pushover!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Stand up for yourself like you did just now, and she might look at you differently!
:'''Rocher:''' R&mdash;Really?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Of course! Now, be brave and let them have the treasure, or your wife won't be with you even in your next life!
:'''Rocher:''' Don't... Don't say that!
:'''Kevin:''' Take it easy. They're nice people! If you help them, they'll pay you back!
:'''Rocher:''' In that case, thank you... and please, take these.
:;(A Common Chest appears)

;(Open the chest)
:'''Rocher:''' It's... it's Sir Arthur's body! Ah! So... so cruel...
:'''Paimon:''' And... is there anything else?
:{{DIcon}} Then it should be in the final place.
:'''Kevin:''' Baulande, come on, we're heading to the next place.
:;(The dog runs over to Kevin, Rocher, Paimon, and the Traveler. "Intrepid Valberry" and Boss are still squaring off against each other.)
:'''Baulande? Lombroso?:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Rocher:''' Huh? Lombroso? Where did you run off to? I thought you didn't need me anymore...
:'''Baulande? Lombroso?:''' (The puppy wags its tail excitedly, as if saying, "How's that possible?")
:'''Kevin:''' Lombroso? Er, Mister Rocher, are you mistaken? His name is Baulande...
:'''Rocher:''' What? If it wasn't for Lombroso's companionship, I wouldn't have made it this far. How could I be mistaken...
:'''Kevin:''' Not like I can be mistaken either! What's going on here...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Hey! Can't he belong to you both? Seeing as even I've had more than one home!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, that makes sense! Kevin accidentally drove the puppy away before, right? Maybe that's when he met Rocher and they began roaming around together...
:'''Rocher:''' I&mdash;Is that really what happened?
:'''Baulande! Lombroso!:''' (The puppy wags its tail excitedly, as if saying, "That's right!")
:'''Boss:''' Valberry! You've got some nerve! The dog wouldn't forget its two owners, and as for you, you betrayed your own boss twice!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' You scheming dog! I'm going to hand you over to the Marechaussee Phantom! I'm taking you down with me!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Ah, farewell, friends! Come visit me in the Fortress of Meropide someday!
:'''Paimon:''' Who the heck wants to go visit you there!? Well... never mind, forget about them. We need to hurry up and get to the last place.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, Kevin and Rocher! Are you going to fight for the puppy?
:'''Kevin:''' No way! I was the one who really messed up. Baulande can stay wherever he wants from now on.
:'''Rocher:''' I... I'm fine with that too... Lombroso supported me when I was at my worst. I'll support him, too!
:{{DIcon}} Let's get going then.
:'''Paimon:''' Yes! We don't want anyone to beat us to it.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Sir Arthur's Body}})
----
;(Approach Talochard, "Curve," Madeleine, and some Fatui)
:'''Madeleine:''' I'll say it again. Get out of my way! I'm going to see Baulande. We're all coworkers here, there's no need to get rough!
:'''Obstructing Fatui:''' Oh? I'd like to see how good you are now that you've become a mother, Madeleine.
:'''Madeleine:''' ...Don't underestimate mothers!
:'''Talochard:''' Curve, let's go!

;(A fight begins)
:'''Kevin:''' Ah, it's Mom! And Big Sis Talochard, and Big Bro Curve!
:'''Paimon:''' Uh oh, they're fighting the Fatui! We've gotta go help out!

;(After defeating the Fatui)
:'''"Curve":''' Clear mode switched off.
:'''Talochard:''' Paimon! {{Traveler}}, you came! And you brought... Rocher and Kevin.
:'''Talochard:''' It looks like you're doing well, but we've encountered a hiccup &mdash; Madame Madeleine and Kevin's father are both members of the Fatui.
:'''Madeleine:''' I'm sorry that we hid it from you before. We just want to live a peaceful life...
:'''Paimon:''' Fatui? Kevin... Did you know about this?
:'''Kevin:''' Yeah! It turns out that Papa wasn't avoiding being at home. He was actually working... I... I was wrong about him.
:'''Madeleine:''' This was to be his father's last assignment. He was ordered to find Dr. Mosso's base. Once he was done, he would be able to retire early...
:'''Madeleine:''' But I had a bad feeling after you came... I wanted him to give up this mission...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait...! Find the base... retire early... Kevin's father is...
:{{DIcon}} The peripheral personnel, Baulard?
:'''Talochard:''' That's the one, and we only just found out that Baulard is a codename. He's actually Kevin's father, Mr. Baulande!
:'''Kevin:''' I saw a letter before, between Mama and another man signed with the name Baulard... I didn't realize it was my father, no wonder it was so lovey-dovey!
:{{DIcon}} I'm glad it wasn't Rocher.
:'''Paimon:''' Everyone's relationships are complicated enough without a twist like that...
:{{DIcon}} So, where is Baulande now?
:'''Madeleine:''' He removed some objects from the chest when the Fatui stopped us just before...
:'''"Curve":''' Detected&mdash; A figure running away in the distance.
:'''Kevin:''' Ah...! It's Papa, he's fleeing!
:'''Talochard:''' C'mon! Hurry! Don't let him get away!

;(After catching up to Baulard)
:'''Baulande:''' Don't... Stop chasing me... Why are you always going after me?
:'''Paimon:''' We want to know why you're always running away!
:'''Madeleine:''' Just stop it, Baulande.
:;(Baulande turns around)
:'''Baulande:''' Madeleine, why...
:'''Madeleine:''' I did my homework. You're on a mission for a certain Lord [[Harbinger]], aren't you? And it's a dangerous one, too...
:'''Paimon:''' A Harbinger!? Which one?
:'''Madeleine:''' I don't know, but not something we can butt in on. We're just peripheral personnel!
:'''Baulande:''' Even so, I'm one of the better ones...
:'''Talochard:''' Someone stole a letter, but left the envelope at the scene...
:'''Baulande:''' Anyway, I promise I'll be back! This is the last time!
:{{DIcon}} Is that really something you say carelessly?
:{{DIcon}} Things could get quite hairy with a Harbinger involved.
:'''Baulande:''' You don't support my actions either, then?
:'''Madeleine:''' You've done enough, Baulande. Give the stuff to the agents, and come back to us.
:'''Madeleine:''' We can move to a place where no one knows us.
:'''Baulande:''' ...
:'''Rocher:''' Mr. Baulande, stop hesitating and make up your mind!
:'''Baulande:''' Make up my mind... Alright, I... Wait, who are you?
:'''Rocher:''' Um, I...
:'''Talochard:''' Stop changing the topic! Baulande, you don't have any options left. We're not your buddies, you hear?
:'''Baulande:''' You... Ugh, fine. I want to be with my family, too. I hope I'm making the right choice. Here's Sir Arthur's head!
:'''Kevin:''' Great! Father's back, and Sir Arthur is complete!
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything else?
:'''Baulande:''' You mean the treasure? Yes, I came for that, but the head was the only thing in the chest. Maybe the treasure's elsewhere...
:'''Paimon:''' Impossible. We looked for it, and we didn't find any treasures at the other two locations, either.
:'''Talochard:''' No? That's not right. The newspaper...
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe Melo was just bluffing, and she didn't actually put any treasure in the chests?
:'''Rocher:''' Wait, Melo? Who's that?
:'''Paimon:''' Melo Lombroso. Hmm. Wait. Lombroso?
:'''Baulande! Lombroso!:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, Rocher, your dog is called Lombroso, too!?
:'''Rocher:''' ...Well... Actually, Melo Lombroso is my wife. I took her last name, too, but she kicked me out, so I was too embarrassed to continue using it.
:'''Rocher:''' But I miss her a lot, so I named my dog after her.
:{{DIcon}} Huh?
:'''Madeleine:''' Maybe it's not my place to butt in, but as a woman, I'm pretty sure she would not find this flattering.
:'''Rocher:''' But Kevin used your husband's name...
:'''Kevin:''' I was a problem child. What's wrong with a problem child using a problematic name?
:'''Kevin:''' Oh, I see! So you're problematic, too, Mr. Problem!
:'''Talochard:''' Just to double-check... Is your wife, Melo Lombroso, Dr. Mosso's granddaughter?
:'''Rocher:''' That's right! I mentioned my wife came from a rich family, right? That's the Mosso family. What's wrong?
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, now the relationships here are a mess.
:'''Talochard:''' Now, I hope you're prepared to hear this... Your wife might be the culprit behind this case.
:'''Rocher:''' Im... Impossible! She is pure, elegant, and educated! I swear, it's not possible!
:{{DIcon}} But all of our current leads point to her.
:'''Rocher:''' I don't believe it... I'm certain you're wrong. She could never, ever be the culprit!
:'''Talochard:''' I think Euphrasie already contacted your wife. We're going back to the paper now, do you want to come with us?
:'''Rocher:''' ...No! There's absolutely no need, because she's not a criminal!
:'''Kevin:''' Alright, looks like you've got another problem. I think you'll find answers one day, though, and then you can be Mr. Answers!
:'''Rocher:''' Mr. Answers...?
:'''Baulande:''' Anyway, Kevin, we need to go back and get ready to move.
:'''Kevin:''' Okay, dad. Farewell, everyone! I will miss you!

;(Talk to Rocher again, optional)
:'''Rocher:''' Sigh...
:{{DIcon}} Still thinking about your wife?
:'''Rocher:''' Hardly. There's no chance that she's the culprit, after all. Not. At. All. You hear?
:{{DIcon}} Then what are you contemplating?
:'''Rocher:''' I'm thinking about...
:'''Rocher:''' ...Life.
:'''Rocher:''' Right. Also, about that Mr. Answers that Kevin just mentioned... What does that mean?
:{{DIcon}} I don't know.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, do you know?
::'''Paimon:''' Um, someone who's good at answering questions, maybe? Paimon has no idea.
:'''Rocher:''' How about you, Lombroso?
:'''Baulande! Lombroso!:''' (The puppy doesn't speak. Instead, it sits next to the man like an old friend and gazes into the distance, as if looking at their future.)
:'''Rocher:''' Alright, I guess you don't know.
:'''Baulande! Lombroso!:''' (The puppy still doesn't speak. Instead, it sits next to the man like an old friend and gazes into the distance, as if looking at their future.)
:'''Rocher:''' Do you really not know?
:'''Baulande! Lombroso!:''' (Finally, the dog tilts his head and looks at the man next to him, as if saying, "Look, I'm just a dog.")
----
;(Talk to Euphrasie)
:;(Euphrasie and another woman stand at the entrance to The Steambird)
:'''Euphrasie:''' Sorry, we were overthinking things...
:'''Paimon:''' Euphrasie! We've brought Sir Arthur back, and in one piece, too!
:'''Euphrasie:''' Thanks a million! I'll make sure Sir Arthur is taken care of. Also, there's something else...
:'''Paimon:''' See, what did Paimon say? She won't be so worried about Sir Arthur that it would affect her appetite...
:'''Talochard:''' Oh... So, we only found Sir Arthur. Not that anyone got to the treasure ahead of us, either.
:'''Euphrasie:''' ...How can this be?
:'''Talochard:''' So I suspect that Madame Melo might have been bluffing and trying to intimidate you, so that you'd reveal...
:'''???:''' Ahem...
:'''Euphrasie:''' Oh... Anyway, let me introduce this lady. This is Dr. Mosso's granddaughter, Madame Melo Lombroso.
:'''Euphrasie:''' She only returned last night from her hometown to the Court of Fontaine, so she can't be the culprit...
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Good day. In any case, these agents and I are acquainted. I met them when I arrived at the Court of Fontaine last night.
:'''Paimon:''' What?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Upon hearing about my husband's recent hardships and how he was loitering around the paper's office, I was worried he'd stir up trouble. So I thought I'd come over, and that's when I happened upon them discussing something...
:'''Euphrasie:''' Yes, I asked someone to verify her itinerary. There's no issues there.
:'''Talochard:''' So if it isn't her... Who the heck is the culprit...?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Apologies for the disruption. Today, upon hearing the news, I came here to clarify that my family never lodged any complaints with the paper about what happened thirty years ago.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' It was my grandfather's belief that the paper did a good job as well.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Thanks for your's and your family's trust.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Since everything has been cleared up, I shan't stay any longer. I hope The Steambird gets to the bottom of this quickly, regardless.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Wait, Madam. There's something else I must ask you. Do you know the address of Dr. Mosso's research base?
:'''Talochard:''' Wait, so you've got the address, Madame Melo?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Is it you who's in trouble, Miss? I would like to help, but... I don't know where my grandfather's research base is.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Madam, surely, the good doctor must have mentioned it.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' I don't understand. If my grandfather had told me something, how could I not know?
:'''Euphrasie:''' It's possible you weren't aware of some things. Allow me to explain what happened with the doctor. Now, I intend to be totally transparent with you all.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Some believe that thirty years ago, it was the paper's special reporting that stirred up public opinion, which led to his demise.
:'''Euphrasie:''' But the truth is, those articles were not initiated by the paper, but by Dr. Mosso himself...
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Grandfather himself!? He never mentioned this...
:'''Talochard:''' The Marechaussee Phantom files didn't include this either!
:'''Euphrasie:''' Because the deal was off the books. The Editor-in-Chief back then, my mentor, thought that Dr. Mosso's lie detector had the potential to become a hot story.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Being the first to stir things up would help the paper gain the most influence and recognition.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' But... But for my grandfather, how would it benefit him?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Your grandfather's research had hit a bottleneck. He had no more data to feed the lie detector to study, but he needed to go further, so...
:{{DIcon}} He planned to get the data from public opinion?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Right, in a way, the realm of public opinion is like a massive hub for spreading lies... Countless people are churning out true, false, accurate, and inaccurate data every day.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Dr. Mosso thought this lesson on dynamic evolution could surely guide his machine to another level of comprehension, and in separating truth from fiction. It would eventually surpass a machine's rules...
:'''Paimon:''' So... He did it for Curve...
:'''Euphrasie:''' However, the doctor and my mentor both underestimated the destructiveness of public opinion. They lost control. As for what happened next... You know the story.
:'''Paimon:''' But... The key evidence that led to Dr. Mosso's conviction was actually exposed by the paper... Right?
:'''Euphrasie:''' That evidence was actually provided by your grandfather...
:'''Talochard:''' He... He provided evidence that criminalized himself!? How could that be possible!?
:'''Euphrasie:''' I'm sorry... My mentor didn't tell me why Dr. Mosso would do this, but it's the truth.
:'''Talochard:''' Sorry, Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie... I might need to seek confirmation from Curve regarding your words.
:'''"Curve":''' Biological indicators detected to be normal: Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie is telling the truth.
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: The Mosso Protocols within my core have been modified hundreds of times. The log indicates that these modifications were made by Dr. Mosso.
:'''Paimon:''' The Mosso Protocols were changed a hundred times!? So that means... The doctor really manipulated the test results...
:'''Talochard:''' ...So why would he give evidence of this to the paper? He planned to confess?
:{{DIcon}} But then he requested a duel, didn't he?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't... make heads or tails of this! It makes no sense...
:'''Talochard:''' He really lied to the public? Why?
:'''"Curve":''' The data on this question is unresolved. My lie-learning module cannot provide an answer.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, great... Now Curve's become a problem robot.
:'''Talochard:''' Dr. Mosso's research base holds the answer... I can feel it. We must find it...
:'''Talochard:''' Euphrasie, you just said that Madame Melo had the clues to the base, yes?
:'''Euphrasie:''' On the eve of the duel, Dr. Mosso mentioned in a message to my mentor that he would leave the base's location with his beloved granddaughter.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' He... left it to me!?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Yes, please try to recall. Did the doctor mention anything to you before he left?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' I was so young then. Father wouldn't let me go to the Duelists' Ring to see my grandfather... but the last time I saw him was the day he was detained. It was very early...
:'''Talochard:''' So... Did he give you anything?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' All I remember is that once the duel was finished, my father brought a piece of jewelry that had been cleaned. He said that my grandfather left it for me...
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Perhaps... The jewelry could be connected to the base?
:'''Talochard:''' I'm sorry to ask... but could we have a look at it?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' I wouldn't have minded, but... My good-for-nothing husband sold it to pay off a debt...
:'''Paimon:''' What!? So Rocher gave it to...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry... Is this it?
:;(Opens Talochard's Investigation Notes)
:'''What do you want to show?'''

;(Submit an incorrect item)
:'''Paimon:''' What does this have to do with the jewelry?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' What did you want to show me?
:;(Reopens Talochard's Investigation Notes)

;(Submit Old Clockwork Locket)
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' How... How did you end up with this? This is a photo of me when I was little. My grandfather took it...
:'''Paimon:''' Really? What a coincidence! Are there only photos of Madame Melo in there?
:'''Euphrasie:''' According to my mentor, Dr. Mosso did leave some clues for you, Madame Melo. Let's take a look...
:'''Talochard:''' Look, there's a line of text under the photo...
:'''Talochard:''' "Faded under the sunlight, shining under the sunlight..."
:'''Paimon:''' Faded under the sunlight, but shining under the sunlight... What is it? Does something like that really exist?
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: "The different ways in which lies can exist."
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Different ways in which lies can exist? My grandfather used to say that. How did you... Who are you?
:'''"Curve":''' May I have the photo?
:{{Black Screen|Curve picks up the photo and raises it toward the sky.<br>The sunlight shines through the photo and falls into Curve's eyes, as though passing through thirty years in time.<br>Gradually, another image emerges.}}
:'''Paimon:''' A map! The map leading to the research base!
:'''Talochard:''' So that's how he hid it. I had no idea that we'd already found the base.
:'''Talochard:''' Madame Melo, may we...
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' There's no need to ask. Go. And I just noticed... This special friend of yours...
:;(Melo points to "Curve," then walks up to it)
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Good to see you again, Curve.
:'''"Curve":''' Greetings, Miss.
:'''Talochard:''' Thank you, Madame Melo! Here's your locket. Let's go now!
:'''Paimon:''' But... We haven't found the person who sent the threats.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Don't worry, Paimon. I think you're right in that the criminal doesn't have any evidence, and it's just a bluff.
:'''Euphrasie:''' So... Go. Find what you're looking for.

;(Approach the Teleport Waypoint in [[Morte Region]]'s Mysterious Ruins)
:'''Paimon:''' So the base is completely submerged! No wonder no one knew where it was.
:'''Talochard:''' Curve, are you alright?
:'''"Curve":''' Moisture has seeped into the motherboard. Core functionality: 12%.
:'''Talochard:''' We have to hurry...

;(Approach the door)
:'''Paimon:''' This is probably the entrance, right?
:'''Talochard:''' I think someone was here, there are traces nearby...
:'''Paimon:''' That's impossible. We just got the map, after all.
:'''Talochard:''' True... Let's check it out.

;(Approach Talochard and "Curve" at the marked location)
:'''Paimon:''' We're finally inside! Your home is huge, Curve!
:'''"Curve":''' ...Home?
:'''Talochard:''' Hurry up. We need to find the materials ASAP.
:'''Talochard:''' I sure hope you left behind instructions on how to fix Curve, Dr. Mosso!

;(Read Letter to the Editor-in-Chief)
::'''Letter to the Editor-in-Chief (Draft)'''
::Dear Editor-in-Chief, you are correct in your judgment that the matter has reached the point of no return.
::These last few days, I've heard marchers calling for Curve to be destroyed. Last night, radical students broke into my lab and tried to do just that. Luckily, I discovered them in time.
::However, Curve is in increasing danger. I am compelled to act, and my plan is the following:
::1. I will revise the Mosso Protocols and related data (of no practical significance) in Curve's core so that what remains is a sufficiently misleading trail: It will appear lie detectors are not capable of detecting lies and that all the test results were covertly manipulated by myself.
::As for the "ironclad evidence of fraud and deception of the public," I'll leave that in your capable hands. Kindly select a date for the "exposure."
::2. As soon as I am convicted, I shall propose a duel. And when I fall in the Duelists' Ring, all will be put to rest.
::3. I humbly request that you mobilize your paper to divert attention away from Curve. It should be thought of as a "useless sham of a machine" to be used as evidence in the case and then sealed away by the Marechaussee Phantom.
::There's no need to try and change my mind. I've thought through every last detail, and this storm is unlikely to pass until I, the main offender, am dead. ::Curve is my life's work, so I can't afford any more missteps. I ask that you exchange my life for his.
::(Everything we've done so far has been effective, and Curve's lie-learning module has derived redundant data that is incomprehensible. I believe that the seed of life has sprouted within him.)
::Yours Sincerely,
::Mosso Lombroso
:'''Paimon:''' Is this the secret letter between Dr. Mosso and Euphrasie's predecessor? He seems to have mentioned something important...
:'''Talochard:''' ...
:'''Talochard:''' Dr. Mosso didn't forge anything, other than the "forged evidence," which he forged and gave to the newspaper, so he'd take all the heat.
:'''Paimon:''' He wanted everyone to focus on him and let it end there. He was...

;(After defeating the first wave, the cannon suddenly activates)
:'''???:''' Ha, knew you'd be tough customers. Time to try out what Dr. Mosso left behind... You'll be the test subjects!

;(Approach the marked area after defeating the second wave)
:'''???:''' Blast! What's wrong!?
:;("Curve" and Talochard are standing by the cannon)
:'''"Curve":''' I have now taken over... the cannon's control systems.
:'''Talochard:''' Curve! Are you okay? That's great!
:;(Traveler runs over to the cannon)
:'''Paimon:''' Quick... fire at the Fatui!

;(After defeating all enemies)
:;(Jenck stands at the operating mechanism)
:'''Jenck:''' Curses! You're not easy to deal with... No wonder the Fatui are so reluctant to face you.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Editor Jenck? Why are you here...? How do you know about this place!?
:'''Jenck:''' Heh, you were discussing the base's location so freely right in front of the paper's doors... It would have been rude of me not to take advantage of such generosity.
:'''Talochard:''' Jenck... you eavesdropped! I was right all along! You're the culprit!
:'''Jenck:''' Haha... the culprit... Agent Talochard, are you going to start cawing like a crow again?
:{{DIcon}} It's useless to try and deny it.
:'''Jenck:''' You are right! Indeed, I am the culprit, but I only wanted to help this moronic excuse for an agent to sort out the case.
:'''Jenck:''' It's not like she can just write, "That guy called me a crow, so he must be the culprit!" or something like that in the case file, now can she?
:'''Talochard:''' You!
:'''Jenck:''' Shh, shh, hush now. How about using your brain instead of your temper for once? Surely, you must still have a number of questions regarding this case? Such as my motives, aren't you the least bit curious?
:'''Paimon:''' You just wanted all of Curve's research materials, didn't you!
:'''Talochard:''' And the paper's alleged "dirt" on Mosso faking results from back then?
:'''Jenck:''' Oh, looks like that question was far too easy. And as for the second question... I'm merely a low-level editor, how could little old me possibly be privy to such secrets at the paper?
:{{DIcon}} Enough. (Attack)
::'''Jenck:''' Wait! I'm the one who took Dr. Mosso's materials, you know, so I learned all about the base's self-destruct system. If you act rashly towards me, then it won't end well for anyone here.
::'''Jenck:''' Traveler, you're the stuff of legends. You're strong, but as for your precious little companions, I can't help but wonder how they might fare in such a massive explosion...
::'''Paimon:''' You... You're just bluffing!
::'''Jenck:''' It would be better for everyone to just keep on thinking. After all, I'm merely a low-level editor, how could little old me possibly be privy to such secrets at the paper?
:{{DIcon}} How should I know?
:'''Talochard:''' Ugh... You must have learned about it from Baulard!
:'''Jenck:''' Bingo! It was Baulard who came knocking. That's when I realized the paper had made a serious error thirty years ago, causing the downfall of a genius scientist.
:'''Jenck:''' More importantly, isn't it truly a lamentable loss that the scientist's legacy has been buried for so long? Shouldn't the paper apologize to the general public for this?
:'''Paimon:''' What... What do you mean? Is exposing what happened really all you're after?
:'''Jenck:''' Exposing? Ha! Hehe... There's a much more suitable word &mdash; judgment. People will pass judgment on the newspaper like they did Dr. Mosso. The paper must take responsibility for this!
:'''Paimon:''' How... How can you make yourself sound so righteous like that with a straight face!?
:'''Jenck:''' But is it not the simple truth? I'm the hero who recently exposed the Confrerie's fraud. The righteous and valiant Jenck, that's how everyone should see me, no?
:'''Talochard:''' No! You sanctimonious scoundrel! You just want to profit from all of this!
:'''Talochard:''' If the public starts to denounce the paper, Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie will be in trouble! You... You just want the top spot!
:'''Jenck:''' Excellent! Perfect! I must admit, what you imagine isn't completely wrong, so allow me to fill in a few gaps for you.
:'''Jenck:''' I've already made a deal with Baulard's supervisor &mdash; I find Dr. Mosso's inheritance for them, and they help me take over The Steambird.
:'''Jenck:''' Plus, Baulard's supervisor serves a real VIP &mdash; a Harbinger, hehe...
:{{DIcon}} Which Harbinger?
:'''Jenck:''' None of your business. With a Harbinger's backing, Euphrasie won't stand a chance, and The Steambird will be mine!
:'''Talochard:''' Jenck, you're just a squawking blackbird with a silver tongue! We won't let you get away with this!
:'''Jenck:''' ...But you'll have to stay alive to do that. I'm so sorry, can you not hear anything yet?
:{{Black Screen|Click, click click, click click click...<br>Click, click click, click click click...<br>Click, click click, click click click...<br>An ominous sound is echoing through the base.}}
:'''Paimon:''' What is that!?
:'''Jenck:''' Ha, the self-destruction system. How perfect! It just takes a little time to get going... A big thank you to Dr. Mosso for writing the instructions. And thank you, everyone, for giving me the time.
:'''Talochard:''' Uh-oh...
:'''Jenck:''' Farewell, Little Crow, Agent Curve, and you two visitors from afar. Use these last moments to embrace each other, then rest in peace as you are buried along with the truth.
:{{Black Screen|Jenck practically flies out of the entrance.<br>The door closes behind him with a heavy thud.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no! So he was the one who took the materials after all!&nbsp;...Are we going to be blown to smithereens!?

:'''"Curve":''' Calculating survival probably of own core module... calculation successful... result: 1%.
:'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;How can this be... no, no, no! {{Traveler}}, we've got to do something! Can we dig our way out?
:'''"Curve":''' The self-destruct's cables run through the walls. Breaking through could lead to an early detonation, as could attempting to force the door.
:{{DIcon}} I'll do my best to protect you. All of you.
:'''Talochard:''' Is this all because of me again...
:'''"Curve":''' Agent Talochard, don't... blame yourself. There's no need to worry, everyone.
:'''"Curve":''' Because... I am able to shut down the base's self-destruct system.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Curve! Why didn't you say so earlier! Paimon was getting all worried for nothing!
:'''"Curve":''' You... didn't ask earlier?
:'''Paimon:''' Well... Seems like you even have a sense of humor... Now tell us what to do!
:'''"Curve":''' Please... kindly withdraw my core module... and place it in the base's control panel...
:'''"Curve":''' Then... I will be able to... open the safe room lock... there is a button that disables the self-destruct system... inside the safe room.
:'''Paimon:''' You mean, you open the door for us, we go to the safe room and press the button inside, and everything will be taken care of?
:'''"Curve":''' That is correct...
:'''Talochard:''' And you? Curve, can your core be removed from the control panel afterward?
:'''"Curve":''' I... must stay connected... the control panel... otherwise... the safe room will... relock...
:{{DIcon}} Seems like we should take care of the self-destruct system first.
:'''"Curve":''' ...Urgent... Please act fast...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, take Curve's core and place it in the control panel! All we need to do is deactivate the self-destruct system!
:'''Talochard:''' Curve, will this really work? I think you might be a bit...
:'''"Curve":''' Please take action... repeat... please ta-take action... repeat... re-repeat... pl&mdash;please please please take...

;(After inserting "Curve"'s core)
:{{Black Screen|The door to the safe room opens with a light shudder.}}

:'''Talochard:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Talochard! Don't stand around, let's head to the emergency room!

;(Approach the room)
:'''Paimon:''' Is this it? It doesn't seem like a safe room... and where's the button?
:'''Talochard:''' Curve! What is this place? We can't see any buttons!
:;(The area shakes, then the gate shuts behind them)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Eh? EHHHH? Why did the door just close?
:'''"Curve":''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Curve! What's going on? How do we stop the base from self-destructing?
:'''"Curve":''' The self-destruct system cannot be deactivated...
:'''Paimon:''' What? So are we...
:'''"Curve":''' Apologies. Please escape as quickly as possible...
:;(The previous chamber starts self-detonating)

;(The other three emerge on the shore)
:'''Talochard:''' Curve... you...

:'''Talochard:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Just now...
:'''Talochard:''' NO! I need to go back and find Curve!
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, uhm... Talochard... Don't be too reckless...
:{{DIcon}} Going back is extremely dangerous.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! There was just an explosion, and it's so deep underwater... Curve wouldn't want you running right back into danger!
:'''Talochard:''' You are... *sigh*... You are correct, I shouldn't act like this...
:'''Paimon:''' But... didn't he say the self-destruct mechanism could be shut off?
:{{DIcon}} He lied.
:'''Talochard:''' ...He can't shut it down, his core can only open the emergency exit...
:'''Paimon:''' So then why...
:'''Talochard:''' His core had to be inside the control panel to open the emergency exit... But he's smart now, he knew we wouldn't leave him behind...
:'''Talochard:''' So he lied to us...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh wow... He can already think like that? Wouldn't that... when did he...
:'''Talochard:''' It must have been Dr. Mosso's letter that made Curve understand the final question... He learned about what Dr. Mosso did for him...
:'''Talochard:''' Turns out I'm useless after all... If only I were more competent, maybe I could have helped him break the protocols, and we wouldn't have had to come here...
:{{DIcon}} But the letter might just have been the final push.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right. Don't blame yourself, Curve's breakthrough probably started a long time ago...
:'''Talochard:''' His breakthrough... had already started?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's say you eat 100 Slimes in one sitting and get super fat! You can't blame it all on the last Slime.
:'''Paimon:''' It's the same with Curve. Even if the doctor's letter was crucial, all the work you did with Curve before wasn't wasted at all!
:'''Talochard:''' Is that really true...? Well... I don't know.
:'''Talochard:''' Curve... The question you're leaving behind, I may never understand it.
:'''Talochard:''' Anyway, thank you... and I know what we should do next &mdash; catch that awful scoundrel Jenck!
:'''Talochard:''' Absolutely! Definitely! He must be tried for his crimes!

;(Approach Euphrasie)
:'''Euphrasie:''' Ah, you're finally here...
:'''Euphrasie:''' It turns out that we don't know our own people well enough. This allowed an employee to create some serious trouble. I offer my sincerest apologies... especially to you, Agent Talochard.
:'''Talochard:''' It's not your fault, Euphrasie. Right now, the important thing is that we stop that odious scoundrel!
:'''Talochard:''' By the way, you were so anxious to meet us... is it because he contacted you?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Actually, I received a message. Earlier this morning, Jenck was left in the [[Opera Epiclese]], all trussed up... So I contacted you immediately.
:'''Talochard:''' He's been caught!? By who!?
:'''Euphrasie:''' We're still not sure...
:'''Euphrasie:''' By the time he was found, he seemed to have lost his mind. He didn't react to any external stimuli at all, he was just kneeling on the stage of the Opera Epiclese. He looked like... a doll that had just stood trial...
:'''Euphrasie:''' The [[Maison Gardiennage]] folks took him in. When they examined him, they found that his tongue was missing...
:'''Paimon:''' His tongue!? Oh my... that's... terrifying!
:'''Euphrasie:''' The Maison Gardiennage also discovered a note in his mouth, it said something to the effect of making amends to you...
:{{DIcon}} Making amends to us?
:'''Euphrasie:''' You, Paimon, Talochard. Your names were written on the paper. Seems like the person who was backing him wants to apologize to you three...
:'''Euphrasie:''' It appears they don't want to make enemies out of you. Or maybe they feel quite strongly about what happened to Agent Curve. Those are the only possibilities I can think of...
:'''Paimon:''' The person behind him... Paimon remembers Jenck said that he had a deal with a Fatui Harbinger... but which one?
:{{DIcon}} ([[Sandrone|A Harbinger interested in machine intelligence?]])
:'''Talochard:''' How about Dr. Mosso's legacy? Jenck took all of Curve's design and research data...
:'''Euphrasie:''' Gone without a trace...
:'''Paimon:''' That wretched Jenck! That's what happens when you decide to go full evil! I guess this counts as him being tried for his crimes, right? Though, we don't know who the judge is...
:'''Talochard:''' So that's what happened...
:'''Talochard:''' Though I didn't catch him personally, at least I feel like he finally paid the price for his crimes... *sigh*
:'''Talochard:''' Since all of your names are on the paper, the Maison Gardiennage will probably want to pay you a visit. I'll go over right now and explain everything so they won't bother you.
:'''Talochard:''' Finally... I hope the case can end here...
:'''Euphrasie:''' Wait, Agent Talochard... Would you mind going back to the newspaper with me?
:'''Talochard:''' Why, Euphrasie? If you want to convince me to write your fantasy column, it's not happening.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Still in the mood to joke, I see. That makes me feel much better.
:'''Talochard:''' Let's go.
:;(The four walk over to The Steambird)
:'''Talochard:''' But I wasn't joking at all, you know. I will work very hard and do my best in the Marechaussee Phantom.

:;(At The Steambird, Sir Arthur has been returned to his normal place)
:'''Euphrasie:''' Please have a look. We've fixed Sir Arthur.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, it's Sir Arthur, we almost forgot about it! Good job! Sir Arthur sure has been through a lot...
:'''Paimon:''' By the way, Paimon still doesn't know what kind of bird Sir Arthur is.
:'''Euphrasie:''' A pelican.
:'''Paimon:''' A... Pelican? You mean the kind of bird that's an amazing eater?
:'''Talochard:''' But why would the Steambird's mascot be a pelican? That doesn't seem like it has anything to do with the newspaper at all...
:'''Euphrasie:''' Haha! I'm not clear on that, either. It was a decision my mentor made after the incident with Dr. Mosso.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Maybe he felt it's cuter than, say, a crow or blackbird that squawks all day long.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Euphrasie, you know you kinda resemble a pelican hiding food in its pouch right now!
:'''Euphrasie:''' Hehe! Anyway, Agent Talochard, do you remember how Agent Curve and I interviewed nearby residents at the start of the case?
:'''Talochard:''' Of course. You took the opportunity to blow our cover.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Truly sorry about that, but that was when I asked him, "What kind of person is Agent Talochard?"
:'''Talochard:''' What?
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon remembers... Euphrasie came back and commissioned us right away! Were you awed by Talochard's "brilliant track record?"
:'''Euphrasie:''' Why don't we check with Sir Arthur on that?
:'''Euphrasie:''' During the repairs, I added what Agent Curve said to Sir Arthur's voice library as a memento.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh? Quickly, tell us what Curve said, Sir Arthur!
:'''Sir Arthur:''' "Based on my analysis..."
:'''Sir Arthur:''' "Agent Talochard! Will be the best agent in the Marechaussee Phantom!"
:'''Talochard:''' R&mdash;Really?
:'''Talochard:''' I'll be the best...?
:'''Paimon:''' But, would Curve really have said something like that back then?
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe back then, he already learned to...
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's gotta be it, Talochard! Since you are Curve's handler...
:'''Paimon:''' You must be the one who fed him the first ninety-nine Slimes!
:{{DIcon}} That seems to be the answer.
:'''Talochard:''' ...
:'''Talochard:''' Well then, Curve... I will be the best agent in Marechaussee Phantom!

==Post-Quest Interactions==
===Sir Arthur===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sir Arthur for the first time after completing the quest)
:'''Sir Arthur:''' Extra! Extra! Sir Arthur's regular maintenance has been completed successfully to continue providing high-quality news and information to everyone!
:'''Sir Arthur:''' Please do not believe any rumors about his so-called theft.
:'''Sir Arthur:''' Fontaine is a place of law and order, certainly no place for Sir Arthur to be "publicly stolen and split into three!"

===Melo and Rocher===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Melo Lombroso at the place where Rocher was living)
:'''Paimon:''' What are you doing here? Madame Melo?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Oh, it's you. I heard that no-good husband of mine has a little spot around here, so I figured I'd drop by and check up on him.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' But look what I've found.
:'''Old Photo'''<br>[[File:Old Photo.png|100px]]
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' He actually keeps the photo with him!
:'''Paimon:''' Heh, Uncle Rocher cares deeply about you, Madame.
:'''Paimon:''' We've had our suspicions on you, and Uncle Rocher was the sole voice of dissent. He alone assured us that you could never have committed the crime. We were wondering where he found the confidence to stand up to us...
:{{DIcon}} Probably used up every last ounce of masculinity he had in him.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Oh... Really?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! And didn't he tell you that he lost your locket in gambling? That's not true. He was merely too ashamed to tell the truth.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Oh, that? I heard that story a long time ago, but I never believed it.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' My husband is many things. He may be timorous, somewhat cowardly, and a bit awkward, but he's also a salt-of-the-earth individual. He could be bamboozled, but he's no degenerate gambler.
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' I didn't call him out because I was waiting for him to tell me the truth of his own accord.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, how nice of you. If only we could find him right now...
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' (Shush... Look over there! I'm 100% certain that he's hiding in that box.)
:'''Paimon:''' (...Huh?)
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' (It's an old habit of his. Whenever we'd get into a tiff, he'd go and hide in the nearest closet. And to think he thought I didn't know.)
:{{DIcon}} (Do you want us to fetch him for you?)
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' (No need to inconvenience yourself. Let's see how long he can hold out in there.)
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Right, there's one other thing I could use your help with. If you ever run into Curve and Agent Talochard, please tell them the following:
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' I've tidied up a few of the rooms, so they're welcome here any time. Of course, the House of Lombroso is also open to the two of you.
:'''Paimon:''' But... {{Traveler}}...
:{{DIcon}} Alright, we get it, Madame.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay... then we'll get out of your hair. Paimon does hope Uncle Rocher will come out soon. Have a nice day!
:'''Melo Lombroso:''' Thank you. And best wishes to you, too. May you find the answers to all your questions.

;(Interact with the box where Rocher is hiding, optional)
:'''Strange Box:''' ...
:'''Strange Box:''' Shhhh!

===Messily-Written Letter===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the Messily-Written Letter, located at Talochard's camp)
::{{Readable|title=Messily-Written Letter
|text=<!--
-->Hmph. You've gone down a bad path, Curve.<br><!--
-->Secretly learning to lie without telling us is one thing, but to then immediately turn around and trick us? Are we even friends anymore?<br><!--
-->Today, I'm making sure you get yours. Let's see how you like this trial of strength!<br><!--
-->You owe us. You learned to lie thanks to us (that's what {{Traveler}} and Paimon said), so show some gratitude.<br><!--
-->On the other hand, I suppose I should also thank you lot. I don't think I hate liars as much as I did before spending time with you.<br><!--
-->Just as you said &mdash; liars come in all forms.<br><!--
-->People lie for the sake of face, children, family, and gain, to comfort others, to protect others...<br><!--
-->Tangled lies weave the great web in which people live their lives, right?<br><!--
-->Still, I don't think Dr. Mosso was right when he said that "a curve is the shortest distance between two people."<br><!--
-->There are definitely some times when you should just shoot your shot straight.<br><!--
-->For example, I miss you.}}

-->We've moved! But we thought you might come back, so we've left this for you. Mom says we have to keep our new address a secret for now, so I'll share it with you next time. Hee-hee.<br><!--
-->Thanks to you guys, I think I can say that I found my own answer this time.<br><!--
-->Also, it turns out that Mr. Curve is the kind of person who can't tell a lie! I super admire that. He will always be like a big brother to me!}}
