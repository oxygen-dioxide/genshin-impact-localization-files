'''Riftwolves''', also known as '''Wolves of the Rift'''<ref name="Hdbk">{{Ref/Enemy|Wolves of the Rift|handbook=1}}</ref> or '''Rifthounds''', are a group of enemies found usually in [[Tsurumi Island]] and [[Enkanomiya]].

They currently come in two elements: {{Geo}} and {{Electro}}.

==Description==
Riftwolves are monsters from the [[Abyss]] and are said to be able to erode the boundaries of the world. They were created by the alchemist [[Rhinedottir|Gold]]. Once prevalent throughout Teyvat during the [[cataclysm]], they were the advance guard for the other monsters that were behind them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Cleansing Light}}</ref>

After the cataclysm, the riftwolves were driven to low numbers by numerous hunts and resistance, but have started to re-emerge once more, starting in Inazuma. A group of riftwolves also appeared in [[Wolvendom]] and began to cause havoc to the surrounding area.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Meaning of Lupical}}</ref>

==Strategy==
Riftwolves deal elemental damage of their affinity as their primary damage. They are usually seen in pairs, consisting of two whelps, adults or a mix of the two in the overworld. Only on specific days they are found in a pack of three or four.

Their attacks cause [[Corrosion]] if they connect, but this status can be mitigated by a [[healing]] character. They can also be staggered with sufficient [[poise]] damage as well as [[Frozen]] or petrified to prevent them from attacking. The whelps are lower in weight and can be staggered by attacks that cause sufficient [[displacement]].

Riftwolves start with the same [[resistance]] to all elements, but the resistance to their corresponding element decreases if forced into their devourer state, which is achieved by attacking the rifthound with the same element it is attuned to. However, this makes them fight significantly fiercer. This is signified as a [[Rage]] meter and when filled, the meter disappears and the rifthound's "fur" grows brighter as an indicator. They remain in this state permanently.

==Trivia==
*Gold, the alchemist that created the Riftwolves, classified them as "Alfisol". According to {{w|USDA soil taxonomy}}, Alfisols are a soil order for soils that contain aluminium and iron. They also contain a clay-enriched {{w|subsoil}} and are typically very fertile.
