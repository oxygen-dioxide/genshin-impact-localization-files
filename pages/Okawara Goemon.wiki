:'''Okawara Goemon:''' ...
:'''Okawara Goemon:''' ...
:'''Okawara Goemon:''' What is it? You need anything?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Okawara Goemon:''' You don't even know who I am? Ignorant outlander.
::'''Okawara Goemon:''' I'm the Chief Samurai of the Tenryou Commission. I'm in charge of the security of the Kujou Clan.
::'''Okawara Goemon:''' Everyone knows that I am the best swordsman in Inazuma. You better not try any mischief in front of me.
::{{DIcon}} You're the best in Inazuma?
::'''Okawara Goemon:''' That's right. I have always pursued perfection in my swordsmanship, and I have already reached that perfect state.
::'''Okawara Goemon:''' As far as I am concerned, the best swordsmanship requires you to rely on your own strength, not some heretical Vision.
::'''Okawara Goemon:''' My fellow students couldn't even scratch me with their elemental powers. I even managed to seize their Visions. What a bunch of clowns!
::'''Okawara Goemon:''' Oh? Are you also a swordsman without a Vision? Not bad. If you keep up with your training and somehow become one thousandth the swordsman that I am, I'd say that you've done pretty well for yourself.

::'''Okawara Goemon:''' ...Ridiculous kid.
