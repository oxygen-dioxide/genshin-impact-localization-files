'''Varka''' is the current Grand Master and Knight of Boreas<ref>{{Ref/VO|Barbara|About Varka}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About Varka}}</ref> of the [[Knights of Favonius]]. Half a year ago,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Jean|3}}</ref><ref group="Note">As there are no requirements besides [[Friendship Level]] to unlock the story, it is assumed that it is "narrated" at the start of the Traveler's journey with Paimon. This is in contrast to certain character stories that require quest completion and are thus "narrated" no earlier than certain key points in the Traveler's journey.</ref> he departed on an expedition with four fifths of the Knights of Favonius,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Long Distance Love}}</ref> leaving [[Jean]] as the Acting Grand Master in his absence.

==Profile==
===Introduction===
<!-- Introduction text on the character's page on the official website. <ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [link Varka]</ref>

In-game character profile text. <ref>In-game character profile text.</ref> -->
Based on other people's remarks about him, Varka is one of the strongest people in Mondstadt. [[Tartaglia]] calls him the "titan of the Knights of Favonius" and hopes to one day face him in combat, [[Barbara]] says that there's nothing to worry about as long as he is leading the expedition and [[Eula]] suspects that he had been intentionally holding back during a sparring session.

At some point before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt, Varka brought [[Rosaria]] to Mondstadt so she could redeem herself, although he did not appear to have expected her to do so in her own way. He also accepted [[Eula]] into the Knights of Favonius and met [[Razor]] in the forests of [[Wolvendom]].

===Personality===
<!-- In-game character attributes page text. <ref>In-game character attributes page text.</ref> -->
Varka appears to be jovial and well-liked by the people of Mondstadt. He is rather carefree and often leaves Jean to perform the actual duties required of his position while he goes on expeditions, but Jean does not resent him for it and [[Kaeya]] says he appreciates Varka's attitude.

===Appearance===
Little is known about Varka's appearance, but [[Razor]]'s character stories and voice-overs suggest he is extremely tall.

==Character Mentions==
{{Character Mentions|S-Razor-Character Story 3=Razor's Character Story 4 and voice-overs about Varka make it clear that the "tall man" is Varka.|S-Razor-Character Story 4=Razor's voice-overs about Varka make it clear that the man is Varka.}}

==Trivia==
* Varka gave Razor his name and taught him how to fight with claymores, suggesting he uses them himself.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Razor|About Varka: Memory}}</ref>
* Varka wrote A Letter With Rough Handwriting in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well (Quest)|All's Well That Ends Well]]'' during the event [[Hidden Strife]]. Diluc's reply is found as the [[Hidden_Strife/Story#Letters_in_Jean's_Office|Letter Addressed to Grand Master Varka in Jean's office]] during the event.

===Etymology===
*Varka's name is likely based on the Old Persian '''𐎺𐎼𐎣''' ''varka'', meaning wolf.
