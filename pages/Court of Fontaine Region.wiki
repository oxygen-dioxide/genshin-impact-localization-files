===Delaroche's Notes===
This interactable is located on a crate behind [[Delaroche]]. It appears after completing the [[Delaroche's Bait]] Hidden Exploration Objective, on the next daily reset.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Delaroche's Notes:''' (This seems to be a record of the recipe Delaroche used to make bait...)
:{{DIcon}} Read.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' My 634th day as director &mdash; 75th attempt at formulating bait after meeting the God of Victorious Linebreaking.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' My attempts to analyze the bait samples failed. The highly-adept alchemical process meant that the various raw materials were untraceable, and thus I was forced to combine them by myself.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' I combined the flesh of Cider-Lake-irrigated Sunsettias imported from Mondstadt along with Slime Condensate, using a standard amount for each serving...
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' The results are not promising. The fish did not react at all &mdash; and this, when they're liable to flee whenever things drop into the water!
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' The Sunsettias that that traveling merchant sells are incredibly expensive. That's two days' worth of food money gone down the drain &mdash; best not to buy from him in the future...
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' ...
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' My 635th day as director &mdash; 81st attempt at formulating bait after meeting the God of Victorious Linebreaking.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' Further analysis has proved futile, and thus I press on with my own formulation.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' I combined Sakura petals imported from Inazuma, preserved perfectly in ice blocks, with broken-up Fish, in the hopes that this would attract some vicious, carnivorous fish...
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' But the Linebreakers seemed uninterested, ignoring my provocations...
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' Come on! At least swing your tail my way and tell me you saw what I did!
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' ...
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' My 636th day as director &mdash; 90th attempt at formulating bait after meeting the God of Victorious Linebreaking.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' The researchers all suggest that I give up analyzing the bait samples or commission a professional alchemist to do the job... But I don't know anyone who could do that... So I continue the formulation process on my own.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' This time, I used powdered dried Harra Fruit imported from Sumeru and combined it with Bulle Fruit juice from the latest season. I steamed the mixture over and over, concentrating it as much as I could!
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' This was the... strongest combination of aromas I could possibly have thought of!
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' If I were to make a comparison... It would be like setting up a big pot in front of someone's house and stewing fish-and-radish paste that has been fermented for five years! Why, any sensible neighbor would have rushed out of doors to beat me senseless!
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' Yet these Linebreakers seem to have lost all sense of smell. They did not react at all.
::'''Delaroche's Notes:''' Is my declaration of war simply too weak for them? In that case, I must seek out a curio merchant... I shall obtain the most flavorful items in the world, and I shall have a showdown with those fish &mdash; a battle to end all battles!
:{{DIcon}} Leave.

===Letters to Earnshaw===
This interactable is located on the table near [[Earnshaw]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon}} Investigate.
:'''Traveler:''' (There are a few opened letters on the table...)
:{{DIcon}} (Read the first letter.)
::'''Letter #1:''' "Dear Earnshaw, sorry for being unable to contact you for so long. For various reasons, I moved to the Fortress of Meropide and have been living here for quite some time now."
::'''Letter #1:''' "Life here isn't so bad though! Though, the [[Tasses Ragout]] isn't as good as it is back home, and I don't have the company of any cute animals."
::'''Letter #1:''' "But I have something even more precious in my life now! Speaking of which, I might be able to return home fairly soon."
::'''Letter #1:''' "If the door is still open for me to return, please write me back! Even one sentence will do, just telling me how you're doing."
:{{DIcon}} (Read the second letter.)
::'''Letter #2:''' "You didn't write back. Are you still angry? Dad, listen to me. Don't be mad. Why punish yourself for someone else's mistake?"
::'''Letter #2:''' "Look, I'm the one at fault here. I know I've made mistakes, but that's all in the past now. We can have a fresh start."
::'''Letter #2:''' "My chronic illness has been flaring up again recently. Nothing like being unwell to make you appreciate the joys of being in good health, huh? I hope all is well with you."
::'''Letter #2:''' "If you really don't want to tell me how you've been doing, could you at least tell me about [[Prince]], [[Princess]], and [[Hero]]? Are they doing okay?"
::'''Letter #2:''' "I look forward to your response."
:{{DIcon}} (Read the third letter.)
::'''Letter #3:''' "You're really a stubborn one, Dad. I have some news I was planning to share with you when we saw each other, but I've decided to go ahead and tell you now."
::'''Letter #3:''' "That precious thing in my life I mentioned? Her name is [[Lanoire]], and she's absolutely lovely. She's like a little flower sprouting out of a crack in the rock, determined to grow even in the absence of sunlight or rain."
::'''Letter #3:''' "I'd like to bring her home, I just know you'll adore her! Even if your door is closed to me, at the very least, please open it for her, even if just a crack, just to see her."
::'''Letter #3:''' "After that, I'll bring her to the Court of Fontaine. I'm going to work hard!"
::'''Letter #3:''' "She still hasn't had a good look at this world, so once we leave the Fortress of Meropide, I'm going to give her all the sunlight the world has to offer!"
::'''Letter #3:''' "[[Lutz]] won't let me write too much, so I'll leave it at that for now. Wishing you well!"
:{{DIcon}} (We should go...)
