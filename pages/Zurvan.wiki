==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Zurvan was the very first Pari born from the [[Amrita Pool]], during the [[cataclysm]]. When she first awoke, all of [[Sumeru]] except for the [[Vourukasha Oasis]] was being ravaged by the horrors of the Abyss, and the skies were filled with holes resembling the Sign of Apaosha. Following Simurgh's last wishes, Zurvan gathered Khvarena and fought off the Abyssal demons in the wilderness. She found [[Dainsleif]] shortly after the destruction of [[Khaenri'ah]] and brought him with her to the Oasis. Once he recovered, they both protected the Oasis from the Dev together, until the arrival of the [[Order of Skeptics]], who'd arrived to the region by following Khaenri'ahn remnants that were fighting the Abyssal forces.

With the help of Ruin constructs left behind by the survivors of Khaenri'ah, Zurvan, Dainsleif and [[Nagarjuna]] found the [[Harvisptokhm]] and enacted the first Rite of Ab-Zohr, which purified the skies and the earth, and created the other Pari, who bonded with the Skeptics and helped them destroy the monsters.

===Appearance===
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 2 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->

Zurvan has the same physical shape as other Pari, but her plumage is uniquely colored a pale purple. Being the eldest Pari, her eyes are always closed and are surrounded by wrinkles. She also wears a flower-like crown that surrounds her head.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zurvan:''' I leave it to you to help Sorush out.
:{{DIcon}} About [[the Sign of Apaosha]]...
::'''Zurvan:''' The appearance of the Sign of Apaosha is a result of the constant build-up of defilement.
::'''Zurvan:''' The last time such an occurrence happened was centuries ago. I, along with some human warriors, set about eradicating it.
::'''Zurvan:''' Should the defilement be allowed to erode the structure of the Harvisptokhm, then once the filth grows too much for the Khvarena to contain, the [[Tunigi Hollow]]'s rift might just reopen.
:{{DIcon}} About the Pari...
::'''Zurvan:''' We Pari exist to avert the catastrophe and cleanse the defilement.
::'''Zurvan:''' The divine bird Simurgh drank the Amrita and mixed her Khvarena with the water's essence, thus creating countless beings.
::'''Zurvan:''' Among the countless motes of Khvarena, the ones blessed with sentience are us, the Pari.
::'''Zurvan:''' Our power comes from the Primordial Amrita, and one day, so too will our power flow back to its source.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Sorush]]...
::'''Zurvan:''' Don't mind her tough talk. She is a good petal at heart.
::'''Zurvan:''' Sorush was born after the dust of the previous catastrophe settled, and hasn't witnessed the war of old. Hence, she holds many fantasies as to how things were.
::'''Zurvan:''' However, every Pari has a fated responsibility. From this perspective, she is unique. Even I cannot fully comprehend the mysteries of Khvarena...
:{{DIcon}} It's alright.
::'''Zurvan:''' Then, I wish you the best and look forward to hearing the good news!

===Dialogue Set #3===
Available after completing ''[[The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)]]''.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zurvan:''' Ah. We meet again. Did you miss me that much?
:{{DIcon}} About the Sign of Apaosha...
::'''Zurvan:''' Thanks to you, the Sign of Apaosha has been entirely extinguished.
::'''Zurvan:''' Although the power of the defilement can never be fully eradicated, should it wish to return and infest this place, then it may just take a little longer yet.
::'''Zurvan:''' We Pari will also take this chance to rest and recuperate.
:{{DIcon}} About the Pari...
::'''Zurvan:''' We Pari exist to avert the catastrophe and cleanse the defilement.
::'''Zurvan:''' The divine bird Simurgh drank the Amrita and mixed her Khvarena with the water's essence, thus creating countless beings.
::'''Zurvan:''' Amongst the countless motes of Khvarena, the ones blessed with sentience are us, the Pari.
::'''Zurvan:''' Our power comes from the primordial Amrita, and one day, so too will our power flow back to its source.
:{{DIcon}} About Sorush...
::'''Zurvan:''' Ah, Sorush has grown quite a bit. It seems she is indeed worthy of the Bloomguard title. Of course, much of this is thanks to your influence.
::'''Zurvan:''' Please continue to instruct her for what is to come.
:{{DIcon}} About the former generations of the Order of Skeptics...
::'''Zurvan:''' They claimed to be those that once fought side by side with the heroes of Dahri.
::'''Zurvan:''' Although I never met any Dahri aside from that swordsman, any who face the beasts of corruption stands as our ally.
::'''Zurvan:''' Our battle against the defilement will continue on forever. In the face of such an ever-lasting conflict, the regards of humanity is meaningless.
:{{DIcon}} Farewell.
::'''Zurvan:''' We shall meet again.
