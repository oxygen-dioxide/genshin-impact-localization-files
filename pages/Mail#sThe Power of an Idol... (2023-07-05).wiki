|text      = A few days ago, I suddenly thought of you while I was helping a few children with their scrapes and scratches.

Where have your adventures taken you? Do you often get hurt? When you do, do you get timely medical attention? Even you, the amazing Honorary Knight, can't just ignore your injuries! You need to treat your body well in order for it to come through for you when it really counts!

Speaking of which, there were a few kids who were in so much pain while I was cleaning their cuts that they couldn't help but cry. No matter how much I hummed or tried to comfort them, I couldn't help them calm down. But then Sister Rosaria suggested I try something else. So after a bit of thought, I told them the story of the "Honorary Knight who didn't cry, not even in the face of a giant dragon"... and I could hardly believe how well it worked!

Now they all really want to see you in person, it's almost as though you've become their "idol"...

Now, if I could use this opportunity and teach them that "bravery doesn't mean recklessness, and the Honorary Knight never plays any dangerous games," that would be even better...
