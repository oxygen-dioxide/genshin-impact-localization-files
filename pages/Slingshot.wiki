==Description==
One who wished to improve the range and accuracy of slingshots discovered that<br />
Power increases range, but costs accuracy.<br />
So slingshot rocks were replaced with long wooden poles that sported feathers for stability.<br />
The slingshot's limbs were lengthened and the ends recurved to increase pull.<br />
It then dawned on him that he had made a bow.
