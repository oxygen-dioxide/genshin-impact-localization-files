<!--{{Description|}}-->

'''Avatars of Lava''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group found in [[Natlan]].

Similarly to [[Automatons]], Avatars of Lava can be found in a dormant state that can be spotted with [[Elemental Sight]]. 

The [[Eroding Avatar of Lava]] and the boss variant, the [[Lava Dragon Statue]], are unique in that they make use of a [[Fury]] gauge that fills as they are hit with {{Pyro}} attacks. When the gauge reaches specific intervals, they will take DMG equal to a proportion of their HP. Filling the bar automatically defeats the former, while the latter enters a weakness state.

The [[Fluid Avatar of Lava]] does not make use of the Fury gauge but this enemy shares a high [[Pyro]] [[RES]] with [[Lava Dragon Statue]] while last one is not in a weakness state.
