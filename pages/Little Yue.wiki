'''Little Yue''' {{Lang|zh=小月|zh_rm=Xiǎo Yuè}} is a young boy aboard the [[Alcor]], anchored south of [[Guyun Stone Forest]], [[Liyue]]. He can be found roaming the deck and inspecting the crates during daytime.

His parents were both sailors on the [[Crux Fleet]] but died during their voyages, leaving him orphaned. [[Beidou]] and the rest of the fleet then decided to raise him themselves.

Little Yue is friends with [[Changchang]] in [[Liyue Harbor]].

:'''Little Yue:''' Hey there, wanna join the Cygnus Fleet? If you join now, you'll be my second!
:{{DIcon}} The Cygnus Fleet?
::'''Little Yue:''' It's my very own fleet! It's just me right now, but one day, it'll grow into something big!
::'''Little Yue:''' My Ma and Pa were both sailors in the fleet, but they were returned to the sea during a voyage, so Captain Beidou took me in...
::'''Little Yue:''' We have a saying here, it says "the new surpasses the old." Captain Beidou is the one who raised me, my fleet mustn't be an embarrassment to her!
::'''Little Yue:''' I've always wanted to be a sailor myself, but the Captain's forbidden me to go out to sea, saying that it's too dangerous. So this time, I've secretly stowed aboard...
::'''Little Yue:''' I got an earful from Uncle [[Juza]], but I got to go out to sea, and that makes me a sailor now!
:{{DIcon}} Anything you can tell me about the crew?
::'''Little Yue:''' Sure. I know everything about everyone!
::{{DIcon}} Do tell me about the Chief Mate.
:::'''Little Yue:''' Uncle Juza's real huge, and he looks scary, but he's a great guy!
:::'''Little Yue:''' ...Well, and his ears aren't all too good either.
:::'''Little Yue:''' He always mishears what we say. Says it's our fault we're always saying things only insects can hear.
:::'''Little Yue:''' Funny thing is, though, that he only gets like this on land.
:::'''Little Yue:''' It's so noisy out at sea with the crashing waves and all, but somehow he hears us just fine out there. It's really weird...
::{{DIcon}} So, about the crew...
:::'''Little Yue:''' Well, Uncle [[Xu Liushi|Liushi]] loves to sing from the crow's nest. At first, no one knew who was doing that. Almost thought it was a ghost!
:::'''Little Yue:''' Then there's Aunt [[Furong]]. Sometimes, when she's alone, she says the Captain's name over and over, and her face is all red...
:::'''Little Yue:''' Oh yeah, and there's Aunt [[Yinxing]], who really loves animals. You can't take pets on board, so she raises a few fish in her cups...
:::'''Little Yue:''' ...So there was this one time when Uncle [[Sea Drake]] got dead drunk, and he drank her fish with his grog. Till today, she has no clue how they went missing...
:{{DIcon}} About Kaedehara Kazuha...
:;(After completing [[Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves]]){{Verify|could it be unlocked earlier than this?}}
::'''Little Yue:''' Eh? That name sure sounds familiar... Oh, right, you mean that red-garbed guy from abroad!
::'''Little Yue:''' He always sits by himself saying some real complicated stuff... But I've heard Uncle Liushi say that this guy can tell the weather as well as he can!
::'''Little Yue:''' He even played me a tune once on a leaf. I never even knew that was possible!
::'''Little Yue:''' So... I guess he's a good guy!
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Little Yue:''' Seeya. Sign up soon if you want to join my fleet!
