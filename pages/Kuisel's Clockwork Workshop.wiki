{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop|It|Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop}} was once the workshop of a [[clockwork meka]] researcher who took in [[Coutrot]] (AKA "Kuisel") after his expulsion from the [[Fontaine Research Institute]].<ref name="Neatly-Written Notes">Interactable: [[Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop#Neatly-Written Notes|Neatly-Written Notes]]</ref> After that researcher left, Kuisel named the workshop after himself.</p>}}

The building was originally intended to be part of the [[Fortress of Meropide]], but was abandoned for some reason.<ref name="Neatly-Written Notes" />

===Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop===
This interactable is located at the entrance of the cave leading to Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop. It is available prior to completing ''[[Road to the Singularity]]''.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop:''' Research assistants wanted. Offering high salary. Those interested are invited to head to the workshop to discuss terms.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Formerly Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop===
This interactable is located at the entrance after completing ''Road to the Singularity''.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Formerly Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop:''' "Hiring research assistant(s), interesting parties should inquire with Researcher [[Bricole]] inside the workshop."
{{Dialogue End}}

===Friendly Reminder===
Multiples of this interactable are located on crates in the entrance shaft of the Lower Level. These cannot be interacted with after completing ''Road to the Singularity''.{{verify}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kind Reminder:''' Closing all valves will activate the terminal and open the path.

===Messy Experiment Report===
This interactable is located on a desk in the middle room of Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop: Lower Level.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:Experiment Record S-4711
:Attempted to implant the sample into the neural network. Successfully completed insertion...
:...Attempted to alter the sample's behavior patterns using many different methods, including...
:...All attempts ended in failure.
:Consider retaining the sample as a defense mechanism for the facility, and to make future research easier.
:...

:Experiment Record E-13
:Attempted to implant the sample into the neural network. Successfully completed insertion...
:...verbal command attempts using natural language ended in failure...
:Consider retaining the sample as a defense mechanism for the facility, and to make future research easier.

===Scribbled Notes===
This interactable is located on the left desk in the eastern room in the Middle Level.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:...Failure to comprehend the meaning of the research will only obstruct the road to the technological singularity.
:...not taking the project away from me, but taking the future from humanity.
:...cannot end like this. They are all dead now, because that's how it ends for beings made of flesh and blood...
:Pain, weakness... All of these must be thoroughly eradicated within this generation, by whatever means necessary...

:...
:Good, very good, most excellent. I've figured it all out. The previous approach is completely feasible, it is just that more experiments are required.
:...Self-reproduction... Until the entire world has been incorporated... Commands can be sent across a thousand miles in an instant through the network...
:...No more low efficiency...
:...Efficiency... Just like that of the clockwork meka... Absolute efficiency... Integrating all resources in order to advance...

:...
:...Just like [[Erinnyes (NPC)|Erinnyes]] said in the play...
:...Just like the [[Lochknight]] who resisted [[Remuria]]...
:...They don't understand yet... but they will. They will.

:(The script that follows is too sloppy to make out.)

===Neatly-Written Notes===
This interactable is located on the right desk in the eastern room in the Middle Level.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:The pipelines are having problems yet again. Spent the whole day checking but couldn't fix them.
:...

:[[Coutrot|A weird guy]] came over, said he wanted to be an assistant. He looked way older than his voice sounded.
:I didn't want any trouble, so I was just honest about it and told him if he wanted to be my assistant, he'd have to work for free. I barely have enough savings to pay for my own meals &mdash; no way I could I fork out wages on top of that.
:But he said he didn't want payment, just a place to use. He knew that this isn't private property, just an abandoned building that failed to become part of the [[Fortress of Meropide|Fortress]].
:No idea how he found that out, but nothing I could do about it. It certainly has more than ample room for two weirdos who're into clockwork meka.
:...

:He always locks himself up when modifying the meka, probably because he's afraid of me stealing his techniques.
:But other than that, I'd say he's a wonderful partner. Not only did he fix the pipelines, he even installed regulator valves. Also, haven't ever run short on energy storage devices since he came. I guess he wasn't joking about having solid Institute connections.
:...

:We've ended up with a huge number of clockwork meka without me even realizing it. I could see them roaming around when I woke up in the middle of the night.
:Don't think things are going particularly well for him. He talks to himself a lot and even screams at the meka. They seem to be afraid of him, but can clockwork meka even feel fear?
:I think his nerves are rubbing off on me. I should get out of here for a bit, enjoy some fresh air.
:Even though I was here first... I ought to say goodbye to him before I leave.
