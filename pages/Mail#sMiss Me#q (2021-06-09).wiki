|text    = Hey, cutie. Have you missed me lately?

Me? Oh, you know &mdash; library duties, potion-making, the usual.

On days when it's not too busy, I like to relax with some tea, thinking about you... Somehow, it always puts a smile on my face.

Oh, and speaking of tea...

I got a little bored of regular black tea lately and wanted to try something new. So I tried stirring dried [[Calla Lily]] and [[Jam]] into hot water to make a kind of fruity floral infusion. It's natural, fresh, and really rather rejuvenating. You should try it sometime.

If you don't feel like doing much today, why don't you come and see me for a while? I'll brew one for you.
