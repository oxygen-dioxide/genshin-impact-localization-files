|description = Humanity's best friend!<br>These Fontainian pet dogs have had their fur meticulously groomed and are adorned with custom-made apparel. These dogs have a gentlemanly temperament and also carry with them a multifunctional tool that has a resemblance to a cane. It is said that this breed is extremely intelligent and its sensitivity to fragrances far surpasses other dog breeds. At the same time, it also has a keen sense of aesthetics, allowing it to step into the role of a consultant that provides valuable advice regarding scents, apparel, and the household's interior ensemble. This allows their owner to face life with a calm and regal attitude, thus granting these dogs a good reputation as "elegant guides."
