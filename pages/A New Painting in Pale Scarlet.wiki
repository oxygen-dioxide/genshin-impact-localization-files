==Summary==
The next day passes and the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] head out to the docks to greet their next guest. They spot [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] by the pier and greet him. Kazuha is surprised to see the Traveler and Paimon as the guides for the festival, while Paimon remarks that she hadn't expected him to be a guest. Kazuha states that he had gotten an invitation and felt obliged to visit to meet up with old friends. While disembarking, he also heard unusual footsteps but the person had disappeared before he could react, but found a piece of paper at his feet and gives it to her. Paimon realizes that the paper is talking about the Five Kasen and mentions seals, which the Traveler believes they could use to help [[Xingqiu]] with his problems. Kazuha notes that he's an experienced carver, and a stamping seal wouldn't be difficult for him.

The three head to [[Albedo]] and inform him of the new discovery, with Albedo offering to design the stamps. They then head to [[Uyuu Restaurant]] together and propose the idea to Mr. Hirayama, who accepts and contacts two other authors participating in the event, [[Satomi]] and [[Kadenokouji Kenzaburou]], both of whom agree with the proposal.

As they leave the restaurant, [[Kamisato Ayaka]] and [[Venti]] arrive; Ayaka was preparing some ikebana lessons when she found a strange piece of paper which Venti recognized and thus they went to look for them. Upon inspecting the paper, they deduce that they need to dip the paper in water to reveal its contents. They head to the nearby pond and dip the paper in, revealing more lines. From this, they discover that Akahito was set up. The discovery gives Albedo enough inspiration for the next two portraits, using Kazuha and Ayaka for the last two models.

Albedo finishes the paintings and displays them at the square upon which Paimon wonders where Kuronishi went as he was not mentioned at all in the story. Venti and Albedo reveal that he was already embedded in the other stories and was the one who framed Akahito and blackmailed Aoi. Albedo then connects the similarities between the two stories and wonders who the Kuronishi of their situation is. The group then notices Kazuha contemplating in silence and talk to him. Kazuha tells them that the situation reminds him of his family's past. Ayaka asks him if he was thinking about the [[Raiden Gokaden]], which he confirms.

Ayaka explains that the Raiden Gokaden was the top five schools of forging in Inazuma and that they held positions in the [[Yashiro Commission]]; however, in the present, the [[Amenoma Smithy|Amenoma]] art remains while the Isshin Art was lost despite having descendants - the [[Kaedehara Clan]]. Kazuha states that his grandfather wanted to revive the family business due to his great-grandfather's lack of interest but failed, and in his generation, the last of the clan property was seized. Ayaka states that the Raiden Gokaden had somehow fallen into disarray in a very short span, with three of the schools being completely lost. There was rumors that [[Scaramouche|someone]] wanted to eliminate the Raiden Gokaden as a result of background machinations. However, as the Anemona and Isshin schools still remained, people treated this notion as a conspiracy theory.

Kazuha also tells the group that there was an incident with his great-grandfather when he was young that nearly crippled both his and the Kamisato clans, wondering that the story of the Five Kaisen might be trying to lead him to the truth. However, he tells the group he needs to confirm with someone and asks them to wait tomorrow, intending to tell them all when the time comes.
