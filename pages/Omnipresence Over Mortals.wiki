==Summary==
;Sword, Fish, Resistance
[[Teppei]] takes the [[Traveler]] to [[Watatsumi Island]] for their meeting with [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]. She tells them how she recently accepted an anonymous letter's offer to provide [[Watatsumi Army|the Resistance]] with material so long as they continue to fight the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]. Despite her doubts about the sender's motives, Watatsumi Island's lack of resources left her with little alternative. As the conversation turns to the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], Kokomi voices her opinion that the [[Tenryou Commission]]'s and the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s attitudes towards it "don't add up." After affirming the Traveler's resolve to aid the Resistance despite its precarious situation, Kokomi immediately makes them captain of Swordfish II, a special operations unit. Teppei, eager to step into the battlefield himself, asks for a combat role and is promised one.

After completing their first task with the members of Swordfish II, the unit is assigned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of supplies around [[Fort Mumei]]. They stay in [[Bourou Village]] to train for a few days and chat with Teppei, who has since become the captain of a newly formed special operations unit himself. He gives a glowing review of their new sponsor's supplies and departs for his next mission in high spirits, leaving Paimon awed by Teppei's unexpected improvement.
----
;Those Who Yearn for the Gods' Gaze
While the investigation at Fort Mumei fails to reveal any leads, they notice some oddities in the area. Teppei arrives to provide assistance &mdash; with graying hair and a persistent cough. He dismisses his condition to a cold he got at sea, and explains that the strange atmosphere they are feeling is caused by the [[Tatarigami]], a phenomenon which emerged after the death of [[Orobashi]], the [[god]] of Watatsumi Island slain by the [[Raiden Shogun|Ei]] during the [[Archon War]]. Since then, [[Narukami Island]] and Watatsumi Island have had poor relations. Teppei parts ways with them, warning them that Tatarigami can have ill effects on one's health.

Upon returning to Watatsumi Island, the Traveler finds Kokomi and General [[Gorou]] discussing one of the secret weapons that an officer surrendered to Gorou and their effects on members of the Resistance that have held onto them. The Traveler is horrified to identify the weapon as a vitality-absorbing [[Delusion]], revealing the Resistance's mysterious 'sponsor' is none other than the [[Fatui]]. Kokomi orders that the Resistance be informed to stop using Delusions immediately, and the users be recalled for medical treatment. Realizing that Teppei's condition and sudden burst in combat prowess is likely the result of using one, the Traveler rushes off to find him &mdash; and find themselves too late. Teppei, now with the physical appearance of an old man, is distraught that the new power he thought he finally obtained has instead led him to his demise. As Teppei's life fades away, the Traveler is overcome by fury and swears revenge on the Fatui.
----
;Delusion
To salvage the situation that the Fatui have landed them in, the Traveler decides to dismantle their Delusion manufacturing scheme on their own. Although Kokomi realizes that the Fatui must have had "local support," she is unable to calm the Traveler down and hesitantly gives them the Delusion factory's suspected location. Inside, the Traveler and Paimon realize that the Delusions are being produced with the [[Crystal Marrow]] collected by the [[Kanjou Commission]], and they can find a notice revealing that supposed Resistance member [[Nathan]] is actually a Fatui mole sent to sabotage them.

The two cut their way through the facility before finding themselves face-to-face with [[The Balladeer]], one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]. He takes glee in mocking the "weak" and reveals how all of Inazuma has fallen for the Fatui's schemes, goading the Traveler into falling for his trap. As the Traveler succumbs to the Tatarigami and falls unconscious, [[Yae Miko]] arrives at the scene.
----
;The Servant's Path
The Traveler reawakens at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]], having been rescued by Yae Miko. After reassuring them that Kokomi has resolved the situation at the Delusion factory, Miko explains that she has taken an interest in them given that they met [[Ei]] &mdash; the true Raiden Shogun who dwells within her inner world known as the [[Plane of Euthymia]]. [[The Shogun]] who manages Inazuma's affairs is a puppet made in her likeness, designed with the singular pursuit of eternity. The Traveler intrigued Ei enough to become the first person to meet her since she entered the Plane of Euthymia, which Miko believes will be the key to saving both Inazuma and Ei from a disastrous future.

Miko puts the Traveler through grueling training so they can survive the Electro Archon's attacks, let alone defeat her. Even though neither the Traveler nor the Resistance are any match for Ei in direct combat, Miko is convinced that both will be able to play their parts when the time comes. To weaken the Tenryou Commission, which is spearheading the war, Yae Miko plans to turn [[Kujou Sara]] against them by proving that [[Kujou Takayuki]], Sara's adoptive father and head of the [[Kujou Clan]], has betrayed the Shogunate. Having invited Sara to the shrine, Yae promises the general that they will provide the evidence if Sara agrees to secretly return alone in three days to hear them out further.
----
;Proof of Guilt
To find the evidence they need, the Traveler returns to [[Komore Teahouse]] to meet with [[Kamisato Ayaka]] and [[Thoma]]. With the help of [[Yoimiya]] supplying the Traveler with a distraction so that the [[Shuumatsuban]] ninja [[Sayu]] can easier infiltrate the Tenryou Commission, they successfully obtain Takayuki's falsified, optimistic report of the Shogunate's war efforts and a correspondence with the Fatui.
----
;Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage
Upon reading the documents, Kujou Sara is infuriated by what she sees and storms off to confront her adoptive father. Before the Traveler and Paimon can chase after her, Miko advises them that the only way to meet Ei will be to recreate the scenario as with their first encounter. She also gives them an [[Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori (Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage)|omamori]] as a farewell gift, imparting them with vague promises about what it can do for them.

The two join up with Sara and fight their way through the Tenryou guards until they reach Takayuki. In the ensuing confrontation, he confirms all that they have read, revealing his selfish reasons for accepting the Fatui's proposals. After learning that the Fatui Harbinger [[Signora]] is meeting with the Shogun at [[Tenshukaku]], Sara runs off to confront her, with the Traveler and Paimon following shortly after.
----
;Duel Before the Throne
By the time the Traveler reaches Tenshukaku, they find that Signora has defeated Sara. While Sara's Inazuman heritage spares her from further harm, Signora reminds the Traveler in their ensuing confrontation that they have no such provision as Inazuma's most wanted criminal. Remembering that the victor of a duel before the throne is given a second chance, the Traveler challenges Signora to a duel and the Shogun approves it. Despite the odds, Signora is defeated and is executed by the Shogun's [[Musou no Hitotachi]], her most powerful technique. The Traveler and Paimon, shaken by the display of the Shogun's strength, are given permission to leave Tenshukaku alive.
----
;The Omnipresent God
Outside Tenshukaku, the Traveler and Paimon run into the Resistance forces led by Gorou. Just then, the Shogun cuts through the space behind the Traveler, intending to execute them. [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] miraculously resonates with his [[Kazuha's Friend|late friend]]'s Masterless [[Vision]], using its Electro power combined with his Anemo Vision to block the Musou no Hitotachi and knock the Shogun back. Although she quickly recovers, witnessing the incredible feat invigorates the Resistance members and they charge at her. To prevent them from being slaughtered, the Traveler attacks the Shogun and is brought into the Plane of Euthymia.

Ei turns out to have been aware of the Fatui's involvement all along, having deemed Visions &mdash; specifically, the pursuit of one's aspirations &mdash; to be a greater threat to eternity than a temporary war, her own inaction having been tacit approval. Their clash of wills turns into a duel once again. In the middle of their battle, Miko uses the omamori to enter the Plane of Euthymia, reminding the Traveler that they are fighting on behalf of those who wish for the Vision Hunt Decree's abolition. The light of human ambition from the confiscated Visions outside illuminates the dark and gloomy Plane of Euthymia, and the Traveler defeats Ei with their newfound strength.

After Ei recounts her motivations for pursuing eternity &mdash; experiencing the deaths of her close companions and her sister [[Makoto]], and witnessing the [[Heavenly Principles]]' destruction of [[Khaenri'ah]] &mdash; Miko eventually persuades her that her idea of eternity is bringing too much suffering and loneliness to even herself, pointing out that even the sky of the Plane had lit up with a predawn light as Ei had emotionally 'lit up' with meeting her friend after so long. Conceding to Miko's point, Ei agrees to abolish the Vision Hunt Decree, but tells them that she will need time to reconsider her approach towards ruling Inazuma.
----
;Wishes
After the dust has settled, the Traveler and Paimon meet with Yae Miko. Their delight over stopping the Fatui's plans is dampened when Miko reveals that she rescued them from The Balladeer by giving him the Electro [[Gnosis]]. Having no more use for it, Ei had entrusted it to her before entering the Plane of Euthymia with the knowledge that Miko would 'sell' it, but only for something equally as valuable. As a gesture of thanks for their contributions to Inazuma, Miko offers to answer whatever questions they might have. Her answers give a few important pieces of information: The Balladeer was Ei's prototype puppet who was recruited into the Fatui and augmented until he was strong enough to become the Sixth Harbinger; and that knowledge is managed as a resource in [[Sumeru]], the Traveler and Paimon's next stop, although Miko is unsure whether this was [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s decision or the Sages'. In her parting statement, Miko speculates that the Traveler's lack of a Vision may actually be because they have not yet found an ambition strong enough for them to receive one.
