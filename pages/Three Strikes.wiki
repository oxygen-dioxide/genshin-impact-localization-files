==Trivia==
* The name of this achievement, coupled with ''[[I Can't Take It Anymore!]]'' make reference to a historical story in {{W|Zuo Zhuan}}, depicting the famous {{W|Battle of Changshao}} between Qi and Lu in 684 BC. After the victory, when the Duke of Lu asked for an explanation of the success, General Cao Gui replied, {{Lang|{{zh|「夫战，勇气也。一鼓作气，再而衰，三而竭。彼竭我盈，故克之。」}}|en="The key of battle lies in fighting spirit. At the first drum beat, spirit was raised. On the second time, it declined. On the third time, it was exhausted. Their spirit was exhausted while ours still brimmed, therefore we defeated them."}}
