==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Nervous An is an overworked administrator for the Maritime Authority sector of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. He is also [[Linling]]'s direct supervisor, a role he is not entirely pleased about due to her lack of vigilance in fulfilling her duties &mdash; thus causing them even more work when they have to go back and correct her mistakes.

When he finally has time off during the [[Lantern Rite]] event, he is visibly ecstatic over his five-day vacation.

:'''Nervous An:''' Please retain a copy of your approved mooring license application form for your records... Hey! What are you doing!

::'''Nervous An:''' I'm working, can't you see? I deal with all vessels entering and exiting the harbor, including mooring and customs procedures.
::'''Nervous An:''' Please don't disturb me if you have no business here. The restricted goods approval form... Needs to be signed by a Millelith Sergeant...
::{{DIcon}} Didn't know talking to yourself counts as working.
::'''Nervous An:''' ...Can you stop annoying me? I'm working out what I need to do next.
::'''Nervous An:''' ...Aiya, now I've lost my brain of thought...
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it. Bye.
