==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Nervous An is an overworked administrator for the Maritime Authority sector of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. He is also [[Linling]]'s direct supervisor, a role he is not entirely pleased about due to her lack of vigilance in fulfilling her duties &mdash; thus causing them even more work when they have to go back and correct her mistakes.

When he finally has time off during the [[Lantern Rite]] event, he is visibly ecstatic over his five-day vacation.

::'''Nervous An:''' ...Can you stop annoying me? I'm working out what I need to do next.
::'''Nervous An:''' ...Aiya, now I've lost my brain of thought...

:'''Nervous An:''' Hi! I'm the Manager of the Maritime Authority, and I'm in a fantastic mood right now!

:'''Nervous An:''' ...Freedom! Hahahaha!
:'''Nervous An:''' No more fishing boats and cargo ships trying to get in and out of the harbor; no more application forms and approval forms... For a few days, I can forget all about it!

===Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nervous An:''' Hello there, friend. Have you decided on the sort of kites you'd like to make?
:'''Nervous An:''' Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I just wanted to perhaps use your work as reference material.
:'''Nervous An:''' I've been waiting for this holiday for so long, but now that it's here, I can't figure out which patterns I like...
:'''Nervous An:''' I mean, there's no way I'll be sewing expired documents into a kite, surely?
:'''Nervous An:''' I'm kidding. It's fine even if I don't have my own kite, really. It'll still be interesting watching others fly theirs.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Springtime Charms===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nervous An:''' Hmm... What should I write on this gift envelope...
:'''Nervous An:''' Ugh, what is this? When I'm up to my eyebrows in work, bright ideas cling to me like dead skin, but now that the festive season's upon us, they've all sloughed off and fled for the hills!
:'''Nervous An:''' I was going to ask some Linling for some special ideas, but... You know what, I'd rather find a book of this year's popular festive phrases and just copy that.
:'''Nervous An:''' Forget it, there's still some time. I can just... find some work for which I can apply overtime. Maybe that'll bring the inspiration rushing right back.
