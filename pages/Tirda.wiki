==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tirda:''' Sometimes, I'd wonder if I had been born in the wrong tribe...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
::'''Tirda:''' It's because I was born with a fear of heights.
::'''Tirda:''' That's pretty much the worst curse you can get as a reserve member of the [[Qucusaur Riders]].
::'''Tirda:''' Knowing that, it's also no surprise that I keep failing the Rider prep exams...
::{{DIcon}} That's a right shame...
::'''Tirda:''' Yeah. But even if you weren't born with a fear of heights like me, getting through the Exams is still no walk in the park.
::'''Tirda:''' Those who couldn't pass, like me, are called the "Wingless." Many of us ended up leaving the [[Flower-Feather Clan]].
::'''Tirda:''' Some Wingless are not adept at flying, but are otherwise very capable at fighting. They often find permanent work as warriors in the other tribes.
::'''Tirda:''' I'm not that strong, though, so the only choice left to me was to work as a singer in this restaurant...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Heroes tend to get a chance to show their stuff.
::'''Tirda:''' By that, do you mean that my singing techniques will come in useful?
::'''Tirda:''' Maybe you're right. I suppose the ability to help everyone feel relaxed and happy is a gift in its own right...
::'''Tirda:''' Thanks for saying that, I feel much better. Here, have some flowers. Thank you &mdash; you have no idea what a relief it was to hear your words.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Brilliant Chrysanthemum|20|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, can't really help you there...
::'''Tirda:''' It's alright, it's not your fault.
