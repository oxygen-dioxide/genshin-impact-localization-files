|text1    = Energy blocks can be naturally occurring or artificially created, and are separated into Pneuma Blocks and Ousia Blocks. After collecting an energy block, your next {{Color|help|Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attack}} will, upon hit, release the energy stored within them. This will come in handy when adventuring in a place like Fontaine.

|text2    = With the aid of these energy blocks, characters can unleash Pneuma or Ousia energies even while {{Color|help|underwater}}.<br>Most characters from Fontaine have an Arkhe, and thus can use their attacks to trigger energies {{Color|help|corresponding to their Arkhe attribute}} underwater without the use of Pnuemousia Blocks.
