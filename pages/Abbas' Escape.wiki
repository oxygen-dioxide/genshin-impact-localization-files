'''Abbas' Escape''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] in that takes place in [[Dar al-Shifa]], [[Sumeru]]. It follows the route of [[Abbas]]' escape from the Eleazar Hospital.

==Steps==
# Enter the underground area in Dar al-Shifa
#*Break open the [[Rock Pile]] underneath the [[Dendroculus]] to enter the area. A cutscene will play, which breaks your fall and immediately takes you to the bottom of the pit.
#Reach the exit to the oasis
#* Several caverns are blocked by Rock Piles. Use [[Elemental Sight]] to spot them.
#Interact with the Severely Eroded Hoe

==Gameplay Notes==
* Interacting with the Severely Worn Hoe grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[One Flew Over the Sick Men's Rest]]''.
* The Rock Pile that blocks the exit from the tunnel can be seen from outside, but cannot be broken and displays as a white construct in [[Elemental Sight]]; when viewed in Elemental Sight from the proper side, it appears normally, as a Geo construct.
** The Severely Eroded Hoe is not accessible until the rock is broken.
* Reading the Unknown Person's Etchings, found along the walls of the underground area, is optional.

==Unknown Person's Etchings==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "...I can hear them all. The vicious winds of the desert, Avin's angry weeping for Hakim, the words of God &mdash; I could always hear them. All of them."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "First Hakim, then Avin, then Arbaaz. They all left, dissolving into the yellow sand, leaving me here just to suffer. But my broken mind and body can bear no more."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "O god, protector of all the desert people, mightier than the sandstorm, more glorious than the sun. I beg you, put an end to this trial."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "Free me, I beg you, from the scalpel of the [[Zandik|wicked doctor]], from the potions that make me hurt all over. Let me return to the fields of my home. I beg you, please..."
----
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "Knock, Abbas. Knock harder. If you knock the right place, you can break these mud walls. Then, you will never have to eat grass or lizards again."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "Knock, Abbas. Don't be afraid. You can get out. Don't be afraid. You can get out. Don't be afraid. You can get out..."
----
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "...God punished me. I should have died. But now I'm hiding in this hole. Living like a lizard. That evil doctor has forgotten me, and so has God..."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "...Wait in the pit that was dug, and the end will come, just as he will eventually return with his seven glorious apostles. When that time comes, there will be no more suffering. Hakim and Avin will return to their beloved Aaru Village, and little Arbaaz will have all the sweets he wants. And I..."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "Dunes, Sumpter Beasts, home... Will mom and dad be there waiting for me when the end comes? They are still healthy, so they should be in the fields. They shouldn't..."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "...I don't want to die."
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "Are you still listening, king of all the children of the sand? We have been punished with Eleazar because we were lazy and wasted the precious fields God gave us. I accept this..."
----
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "God, if you are still willing to accept this unworthy believer, Abbas, as your own, please show yourself to me. Speak to me once more. I do not want to dissolve into the yellow sands. Not yet..."
----
:'''Unknown Person's Etchings:''' "God forgives all."

==Severely Eroded Hoe==
:'''Severely Eroded Hoe:''' (A farming tool appearing in a wasteland like this is quite the surprise.)
:'''Severely Eroded Hoe:''' (Other than serious erosion, the handle of the hoe is covered in mud. It seems unusable.)
