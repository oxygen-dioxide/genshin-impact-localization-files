;(Talk to Michica, optional)
:'''Michica:''' The amount of contraband I've confiscated from packages would probably be enough for me to open my own shop.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I picked this up earlier...
::'''Michica:''' Did you, now? Some idiot must have lose {{sic}} it along the way again. Let me see...
:;(Submit {{Item|Torn Letter}})
:::'''Michica:''' ...This letter's from Tirda, if I'm not mistaken.
:::'''Michica:''' Was she trying to get it sent to her tribe? But it's a mess now... We're going to have to return it.
:::'''Michica:''' I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help get this back to Tirda in my stead?
:::'''Michica:''' She sings at the Golden Dusk. You'll find her in no time.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Tirda's Letter}})
:;(Submit {{Item|Damaged Letter}})
:::'''Michica:''' This... looks like Chanca's handwriting.
:::'''Michica:''' If I had to guess, this must be another order invoice. The packaging here is broken &mdash; there's no way we can deliver it this way. This letter shall have to be returned.
:::'''Michica:''' I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help send this back to Chanca in my stead?
:::'''Michica:''' She's the owner of the Weary Inn near the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. You can't miss it.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Chanca's Letter}})
:;(Submit {{Item|Slightly Squashed Package}})
:::'''Michica:''' Muhuru's Gemporium... Imix? Agh, this is an invoice she sent out, isn't it?
:::'''Michica:''' If this gets lost in transit, that kid's going to get an earful from Ms. Cheven.
:::'''Michica:''' I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help me send this back to Imix?
:::'''Michica:''' Muhuru's Gemporium is in the Children of Echoes' lands &mdash; and it's an easy find if ever there was one.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Imix's Package}})
:;(Submit {{Item|Damaged Package}})
:::'''Michica:''' Looks like... it's for Acat.
:::'''Michica:''' ...The packaging's broken. If we resend it as-is, the whole item might get ruined.
:::'''Michica:''' I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help me send this to her?
:::'''Michica:''' She's the owner of Frida's Palette. Don't worry, you couldn't miss her shop's sign even if you tried.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Acat's Package}})

;(Talk to Tirda)
:'''Tirda:''' Sometimes, I'd wonder if I had been born in the wrong tribe...
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I'm here about this missing letter...
:;(Submit {{Item|Torn Letter}} or {{Item|Tirda's Letter}})
::'''Tirda:''' ...Yes. This letter's mine. Thank you.
::'''Tirda:''' I'll write a new one soon. Then I'll get someone to send it to the Flower-Feather Clan.
::'''Tirda:''' ...I hope this next one makes it there safely.
::'''Tirda:''' Here, you've earned this.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Embercore Flower|20|x=3}})

;(Talk to Chanca)
:'''Chanca:''' Looking for somewhere to eat your fill and sleep soundly? Then you've come to the right place.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I'm here about this missing letter...
:;(Submit {{Item|Damaged Letter}} or {{Item|Chanca's Letter}})
::'''Chanca:''' Huh? Yeah, this is my order. Didn't think it would meet with such bad luck...
::'''Chanca:''' Oh well. I'll just have to write another later. This isn't super urgent, anyway.
::'''Chanca:''' Anyway, thanks for bringing the letter back to me. You're sweating all over &mdash; here, have a drink on me.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Milk|20|x=2}})

;(Talk to Imix)
:'''Imix:''' Hello! Someone as radiant as you should definitely wear the most sparkly gems.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I'm here about this missing package...
:;(Submit {{Item|Slightly Squashed Package}} or {{Item|Imix's Package}})
::'''Imix:''' Yeah, this one's mine &mdash; it's the package I sent out!
::'''Imix:''' Oh, thank goodness, I thought I'd sent it off to the wrong address... I'd be smoked if that was the case!
::'''Imix:''' Thank you, truly! Please, take these.
::'''Imix:''' Also, uh... Could you not tell Ms. Cheven about this? I'm begging you!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Iron Chunk|20|x=3}})

;(Talk to Acat)
:'''Acat:''' Welcome. Given that most people are unable to describe the exact color they want, I suggest you bring some reference material with you.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I'm here about this missing package...
:;(Submit {{Item|Damaged Package}} or {{Item|Acat's Package}})
::'''Acat:''' Yeah, this one's mine. Someone from the Children of Echoes wanted to purchase paints, but couldn't tell me what colors he wanted to save his life.
::'''Acat:''' That's why I sent him a package with several small bottles of paint in it &mdash; so he could get his preferences straight before he next shows up.
::'''Acat:''' I'll get this resent &mdash; better that than him coming over here with his ridiculous reference requests...
::'''Acat:''' Ah, right. This is for you. Thanks for getting this package back to me.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Candlecap Mushroom|20|x=3}})
