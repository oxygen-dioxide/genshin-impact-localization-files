|description    = "Of cloud-haze faintly dreaming."<br>A humble and unassuming bedroom alike in many ways to one you might find in [[Wangshu Inn]]. This bedroom's mystery is hard to explain in words. Sometimes it will evoke remembrance in those who pass through, like the sunlight poking through the swirling clouds. Yet it will remove the sorrows therein and leave only the marks of happenings past.<br>We are all adrift in this mortal life, and only by remembering who "we" are can we remain steady along our course. Our thoughts are clearest in the interstice between dreaming and waking. No wonder those who visit Wangshu Inn for a night find themselves re-energized a hundred times over, radiant and ready to embark on their journey once more.
