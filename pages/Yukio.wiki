{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yukio:''' Poultry skewer with BBQ sauce, salty grilled fish, kitsune ramen... Dear customer, how would you like to try some native Inazuma snacks?
:'''Yukio:''' We also serve tea. We have genmaicha, barley, and oolong. Which one would you like? We do not serve alcohol, though.
:{{DIcon}} No alcohol?
::'''Yukio:''' Hmm, odd, is it? Well, think about it. If you drink too much, your taste buds will get numb, and you won't be able to taste how good the dishes are anymore.
::'''Yukio:''' So even if most Inazuman snacks go well with alcohol, we don't serve alcohol here.
::'''Yukio:''' To me, the bitterness and the aftertaste of tea can bring out the taste of the skewers and the sauce better. Alcohol would just cover everything up.
::'''Yukio:''' Aside from the skewers, you might want to order some kitsune ramen if you want something more filling... Ah, by the way, you aren't allergic to beans, are you?
::{{DIcon}} Allergic to beans?
:::'''Yukio:''' There was a case like this before, so it's better safe than sorry for me to ask first.
:::'''Yukio:''' There was an [[Arataki Itto|Oni gentleman]] and a [[Yae Miko|lady with kitsune ears]] who made a bet here on who could eat the most kitsune ramen.
:::'''Yukio:''' But there was fried tofu in the ramen, and the [[Oni]] people are allergic to beans...
:::'''Yukio:''' Therefore, even though that gentleman with long horns won the bet, he also almost lost his life... Was it worthwhile?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I can't drink alcohol yet.
:::'''Yukio:''' I see. You aren't old enough to drink, right? That's also fine. You can order some tea while savoring some of Inazuma's snacks.
:::'''Yukio:''' Here, these Onigiri are freshly made today. They are delicious and filling. Please have some.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Onigiri|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yukio:''' Take care. Come back again next time.

==Event Dialogue==
===Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} {{Color|help|We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.}}
::'''Yukio:''' Hmm? Did I hear you wrong? Is this a music festival or a food festival?
::'''Paimon:''' Music, and a serious, formal musical exchange to boot! By the way, do you have any music you enjoy? We can play it for you right now!
::'''Yukio:''' Oh, you're serious, then? Well, I do have something in mind. I can try humming it for you. Could you try playing it, then?
::{{DIcon}} Sure, I'll give it a go.
::'''Yukio:''' Well then, this is quite the lovely surprise.

;(After performing)
:'''Yukio:''' Wow. What a brilliant recreation! That said, even I have no clue what this song's called, haha.
:'''Yukio:''' A fox-eared customer of ours likes humming this one when she comes over for some ramen. She's one of our VIPs. Came round a few days ago, in fact, or I wouldn't have remembered that song at all.
:'''Yukio:''' ...I guess that tells you all you need to know about me and music, eh?
:'''Yukio:''' If you're looking for a food stall, I'd recommend you look for [[Tomoki]].
:'''Yukio:''' That fellow's got a right adventurous spirit. Even if he isn't a fan of music, he should be interested nonetheless.

;(Talk to Yukio again, optional)
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} How was that?
:;(Same as ''After performing'')
{{Dialogue End}}

===Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival===
====Dialogue Set #1====
''Available before completing [[As Though Caught in a Dream]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yukio:''' Fresh fried tofu! Hot kitsune ramen! Need a break? Come have a bowl!

====Dialogue Set #2====
''Available after completing [[As Though Surrounded by Thunder]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yukio:''' Phew... the Yashiro Commission said they'd take care of my stall for a few days... and what do you know? They're done pretty spiffing work. Everything's spick and span &mdash; why, it's like nothing was touched at all!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* The "Oni gentleman" and "lady with kitsune ears" that Yukio refers to in his dialogue are likely [[Arataki Itto]] and [[Yae Miko]].<ref>{{Ref/VO|Arataki Itto|About the Lady with Fox Ears}}</ref>
* He sells {{ja|獣骨ラーメン|rm=jukotsu raamen}} which is a variation of the real food {{ja|豚骨らーめん|rm=tonkotsu raamen}} meaning "pork bone ramen" however the in-game variant has replaced pork (''ton'') with beast (''ju''), implying Yukio's ramen is essentially a mystery meat ramen from some undisclosed beast.
