==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yukio:''' Poultry skewer with BBQ sauce, salty grilled fish, kitsune ramen... Dear customer, how would you like to try some native Inazuma snacks?
:'''Yukio:''' We also serve tea. We have genmaicha, barley, and oolong. Which one would you like? We do not serve alcohol, though.
:{{DIcon}} No alcohol?
::'''Yukio:''' Hmm, odd, is it? Well, think about it. If you drink too much, your taste buds will get numb, and you won't be able to taste how good the dishes are anymore.
::'''Yukio:''' So even if most Inazuman snacks go well with alcohol, we don't serve alcohol here.
::'''Yukio:''' To me, the bitterness and the aftertaste of tea can bring out the taste of the skewers and the sauce better. Alcohol would just cover everything up.
::'''Yukio:''' Aside from the skewers, you might want to order some kitsune ramen if you want something more filling... Ah, by the way, you aren't allergic to beans, are you?
::{{DIcon}} Allergic to beans?
:::'''Yukio:''' There was a case like this before, so it's better safe than sorry for me to ask first.
:::'''Yukio:''' There was [[Arataki Itto|an Oni gentleman]] and a lady with kitsune ears who made a bet here on who could eat the most kitsune ramen.
:::'''Yukio:''' But there was fried tofu in the ramen, and the [[Oni]] people are allergic to beans...
:::'''Yukio:''' Therefore, even though that gentleman with long horns won the bet, he also almost lost his life... Was it worthwhile?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I can't drink alcohol yet.
:::'''Yukio:''' I see. You aren't old enough to drink, right? That's also fine. You can order some tea while savoring some of Inazuma's snacks.
:::'''Yukio:''' Here, these Onigiri are freshly made today. They are delicious and filling. Please have some.
::;(Obtain [[Onigiri]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yukio:''' Take care. Come back again next time.

==Trivia==
*The "lady with kitsune ears" that Yukio refers to in his dialogue is likely [[Yae Miko]], as she is currently the only known present-day character with that distinct feature.
*He sells {{Lang|ja=獣骨ラーメン|ja_rm=jukotsu ramen|mini=1}} which is a variation of the real food {{Lang|ja=豚骨らーめん|ja_rm=tonkotsu ramen|mini=1}} meaning "pork bone ramen" however the in game variant has replaced pork (ton) with beast (ju) implying Yukio's ramen is essentially a mystery meat ramen from some undisclosed beast.
