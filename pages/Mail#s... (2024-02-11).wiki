|text      = Some researchers stationed in [[Aaru Village]] visiting the [[House of Daena]] a few days ago mentioned a familiar name. Apparently, [[Isak]] is now quite proficient in both reading and writing of [[Vedanagari script]], and the [[Akademiya]] has even sent him some primers.<br><!--
-->I'm sure [[Paimon]]'s no less capable than Isak, right?<br><!--
-->Advanced reading materials are attached to this letter.
