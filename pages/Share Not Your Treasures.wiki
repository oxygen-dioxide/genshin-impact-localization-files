;(Read the Worn Letter)
:'''Worn Letter:''' "...I guess this is where greed gets you. When you want it all and you don't know when to stop. If I'd just called it a day when I'd found the buried treasure and hadn't insisted on going to that stupid wishy-washy bonfire... I never would have triggered the mechanism and got myself trapped here by that awful monster. Now I can't get out."
:'''Worn Letter:''' "Anyone who's got what it takes to take him down, go and make a wish at that bonfire. Any old thing will do. I'll help by, uh... rooting for you. Heh."
:;(After reading the letter)
:'''Paimon:''' There's a map on the back of the letter with markings.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's check out this place. There might be treasures.
:'''Paimon:''' But a campfire that fulfills wishes... Even Paimon knows that such a thing doesn't exist.

;(Approach the bonfire)
:'''Paimon:''' Guess this must be the bonfire. The letter said we should light it up...
:;(After lighting the bonfire)
:'''Paimon:''' ...And nothing happens. So this so-called wish bonfire is just a&mdash;
:;(Treasure Hoarders appear)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! Watch out!

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, these guys show up everywhere...
:'''Paimon:''' What's that over there? Did the Treasure Hoarders drop something?

;(Read the Scribbled Notes)
:'''Scribbled Notes:''' "...This whole thing about the bonfire granting wishes is utter nonsense! Though, the treasures buried underneath are genuine... Boss said I should leave the slip of paper where I found it and just wait nearby &mdash; people are bound to fall for it, and as soon as the fire lights up... Hehehe. A very lucrative stroke of genius this one..."
:'''Scribbled Notes:''' "...That said, there's more treasure here than I can move all in one go. Boss says I should first bury it on the {{Color|buzzword|highest peak in Cuijue Slope}}. There's a big old withered tree on top of the mountain, I'm sure she can't miss it..."

;(Upon approaching the area with the treasure)
:'''Paimon:''' This must be Cuijue Slope. There's supposed to be some buried treasure here so... You up for some digging?
