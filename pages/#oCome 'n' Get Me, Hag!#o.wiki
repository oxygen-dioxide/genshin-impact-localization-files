'''"Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!"''' is [[Mona]]'s [[1st Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{TalentNote|icd|The extra Explosion DMG|0}}
* "Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!" only creates Phantoms when Mona is [[Aggravation#Combat Mode|in combat]].
** A Phantom can be created even if Mona is not close enough to attack an enemy, as long as Mona is in combat.
** No Phantom is created near the [[Unusual Hilichurl]] until it is aggravated.
* Using Illusory Torrent outside of combat counts toward the 2-second timer, although no Phantom will be created until Mona enters combat.
* Remaining stationary while using Illusory Torrent counts toward the 2-second timer.
* The 2-second timer resets when Mona stops using Illusory Torrent or when a Phantom is created from "Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!"
* A Phantom created from "Come 'n' Get Me, Hag!" can exist at the same time as a Phantom from [[Mirror Reflection of Doom]].
