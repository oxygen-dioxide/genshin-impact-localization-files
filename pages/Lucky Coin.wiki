'''Lucky Coin''' is a currency used in the [[Genius Invokation TCG/Card Shop|Card Shop]] for [[Genius Invokation TCG]].

There is a limit of 20,000 Lucky Coins that the player can hold at a time; reaching this limit will bar the player from completing challenge objectives and gaining the corresponding rewards. If, however, the player has less than 20,000 Lucky Coins, then earns Lucky Coins from challenges and exceeds the limit, the extra Lucky Coins will still be earned.
