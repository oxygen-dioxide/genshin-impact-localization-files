'''A New Leaf''' is [[Collei]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Collei's hair is styled by a large hairpin resembling a flower with a black ribbon. She wears an earring with a large gem on her left ear.

Collei's outfit consists of a green shawl with gold tassels worn over a brown dress that exposes her upper back, has detached sleeves, and includes a small black ribbon on the back and several gold trinkets. She also wears a pair of dark gloves that cover only her palms and leave her fingers exposed. Around her waist is a belt; her {{Dendro}} [[Vision]], which has two long orange ribbons attached, hangs from the belt on her left side. She also sports long golden brown open-toe stockings, a golden ornament on her left thigh, black heeled boots with a fur trim that leave her toes exposed, and a long yellow scarf with gold details.
