{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo lnlq002 30 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Paimon feels like we're forgetting something...
:{{A|vo lnlq002 30 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, Cesar's diary! We never found out if the two kids Cesar taught magic to were Lyney and Lynette or not.
:{{A|vo lnlq002 30 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney changed the topic back in the workshop, so we didn't get a chance to bring it up. Oh well, guess we'll just have to ask Lyney tomorrow evening.

;(Talk to Charlotte in the Opera Epiclese, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq003 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Here I am, as we agreed!
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq003 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I wonder what kind of show Lyney has prepared for us this time? Oh, the anticipation, it's killing me!
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq003 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, and how could I forget &mdash; thank you both for capturing Lorenzo. Now that this decade-long case of The Phantom Weasel has finally been put to rest, I'm gonna go through my notes and put it all together into the most spectacular special column piece to ever grace the pages of The Steambird!

;(Approach Jemma and Lynette in the Opera Epiclese)
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's excited to see another of Lyney's magic shows. Wait... Lynette, shouldn't you be on stage by now?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Not this time. My brother's going solo today.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' So I'll be watching with you.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 roberthoudin 01.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! I hope everybody's ready, because the show is about to begin!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 roberthoudin 02.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' The great magician Lyney has prepared a spectacular show for us all tonight, concluding with an all-new grand finale that no audience has ever seen before!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! A new trick!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Thank you all so much for coming. Now, prepare to join me on a journey through the mystical and miraculous.
:{{Black Screen|Lyney wows the audience with his skill...}}
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 01.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' ...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Exciting stuff, isn't it?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 02.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Yes, it's just... It reminds me of him.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder. Cesar was a famous magician, too.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So how did you two first meet, Jemma?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 03.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Hmm? Well, I was out on the street once, and I saw him performing for little children.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 04.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Children love magic, because they're willing to believe in things that can't be rationally explained. Cesar had this amazing way of bringing them into a dream-like world.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 05.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' And somehow... I felt drawn to him, too. So I went up and asked him to do a trick for me.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, that sounds so romantic... What trick did he do?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 06.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' It was... with a flower. He took it in his hand, snapped his fingers, and it magically appeared on my head.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 07.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' I was so happy that day. No one had ever given me a flower before that.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, that's so cute... Actually, now that you mention it, Lyney's done that one before.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 08.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Is that right? Then I suppose he's a romantic at heart, just like Cesar. So let's treasure the time we have with him.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 09.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' After all... You never know when the people dearest to you might... be gone.
:{{DIcon}} Don't be sad.
:{{DIcon}} The killer has been caught.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right. It's all over now.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Paimon doesn't really know how to comfort you, but at the very least, no one's gonna be intimidating you from now on. You can breathe easy at least, right?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Right.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yes, you can breathe easy now, Phantom Weasel.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See, even Lynette says&mdash; Wait, what!?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Phantom Weasel? Lorenzo escape? Where is he?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 10.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Wh&mdash;What do you mean, "Phantom Weasel"?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' As Lyney once said... A performer's job is to commit fully to their role, and put on a flawless performance for their audience.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' But once the bag of tricks is empty, and the curtain falls, it's time to end the show. The spotlight is no place for someone with no more cards up their sleeve.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It's been ten years, Jemma. Aren't you tired of the grieving widow act? I think it's time to put an end to it.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you talking about? Paimon doesn't like this riddle...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon doesn't like where this is going... C'mon, say something!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 gemma 11.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' ...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 roberthoudin 03.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' Ladies and Gentlemen! I hope you're all enjoying the performance so far!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 roberthoudin 04.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' There will now be a brief intermission, after which Lyney will perform the most electrifying act of tonight's show &mdash; the one we've all been waiting for!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 roberthoudin 05.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' The final performance will take place outside of the opera house, so please make your way outside in a calm and orderly fashion.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' The Phantom Weasel never did like public places, did they?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 1 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Don't worry, this place will be quiet soon. Let's talk somewhere else for now.

{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|While you're watching the show, Lynette suddenly reveals that Jemma is the real Phantom Weasel. What's going on?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Jemma and Lynette)
:;(After a period of awkward silence between the four, Lyney approaches)
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Dear me, this is awkward, isn't it? And unfortunately, I'm all out of gadgets, so I'm afraid I can't do any tricks to liven up the mood.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' This is a big mistake for a magician to make. But thankfully, I do have a backup plan... Now, who wants to hear a story?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Lyney, don't we have more important things to address right now?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lynette accused Jemma of being the real Phantom Weasel a moment ago. What the heck's going on?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' All in good time. Magicians are good at guessing what people are thinking. I know the questions you want to ask... and as it happens, the story I'm about to tell might answer a few of them.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Well then, let's hear it! Paimon's dying of curiosity here!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Let's go back to the very beginning. A decade ago, when The Phantom Weasel was terrorizing the Court of Fontaine. She never missed a target, never left a trace, and no treasure was safe from her thieving hands.
:[[File:The Truest Thing Graphic 1.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But as her infamy grew, so did the readiness of the police, and her opportunities to act became ever fewer. Every day, she ran the risk of being exposed for who she was.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course, she could not simply take this lying down, and before long she found her ticket to freedom: She would create a scapegoat, a false Weasel to close the chapter on her behalf.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' After weighing her options, she set her sights on a renowned magician &mdash; Cesar. After all, magic and theft shared enough similarities for people to buy the story when the "truth" came out.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... So then what?
:[[File:The Truest Thing Graphic 2.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Being the master deceiver she was, The Weasel easily earned Cesar's trust. Now all that remained was to frame him for her countless crimes.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' But as she was considering how to make her move, she noticed Cesar's aggrieved pupil, and a new thought entered her mind: "Maybe I don't need to get my hands dirty after all"...
:[[File:The Truest Thing Graphic 3.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' At her encouragement, Lorenzo tampered with Cesar's magic box, causing him to fall to his death.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Afterwards, Lorenzo seized his master's property, and The Weasel set about tarnishing Cesar's reputation. Two co-conspirators committed the perfect crime.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 01.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' I've gotta hand it to you, you're both exceptional storytellers. It's enough to make even me wonder whether there was really another mastermind behind all this, pulling the strings.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 02.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' But I just have one question. You seem to think that I am the villain in this tale. What's brought this on, Lyney? Is it something that Lorenzo said?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Don't worry, Lorenzo said nothing at all.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But I never believed that he was The Weasel, and in fact my investigation only made me more certain of that. He was too forthcoming with his confession &mdash; as if there was something else he was trying to hide.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 03.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' How disappointing. So you'd sooner trust Lorenzo than me, even without a shred of evidence?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' A magician is an expert at playing the audience to get the result they want. And I have no doubt that you, Jemma, are equally talented in this regard.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' With a little help from Lorenzo, you put on a very convincing performance. The lovesick fiancée, whose devotion to her betrothed is unshakable even under threats of violence...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Cesar was maligned and hated by all for ten years, but you? Everyone sympathized with your plight.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Who would suspect for one second that the lovely young lady always seen weeping in front of Cesar's grave was actually the mastermind behind his demise? No, not that poor lady. Perish the thought!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so you mean... The whole intimidation thing was just a hoax? Jemma and Lorenzo were both in on it?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But why would Lorenzo agree to that? And why didn't he sell her out, even at the end? Instead of admitting to being The Weasel himself...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, why indeed? Maybe Jemma herself could enlighten us on that question.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 04.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Well, Lyney, if you're so confident in your version of events, then I think the answer should be obvious.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 05.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Having killed Cesar with his own hands, Lorenzo was plagued by overwhelming guilt.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 06.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Revealing The Phantom Weasel's true identity would serve no purpose. But if the Weasel remained free, then she could take care of Lorenzo's loved ones.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' An excellent answer... Though sadly, a little dull.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 07.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Is that right? Well don't let me bore you. If you'd care to change the topic to something more interesting, I'd be much obliged.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As a matter of fact, there's one thing I'd really like to understand.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Why would the real Weasel have targeted things that only have value to other people? Could you shed any light on that?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 08.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Of course. After all, we're just telling stories here, aren't we?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 09.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' If I had to guess, I would say that the real Weasel must have had a terrible childhood.
:[[File:The Truest Thing Graphic 4.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 10.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Left to fend for herself after her parents died young. Betrayed. Scorned. Beaten...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 11.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' She'd scrounge waste paper from garbage bins to draw on, using twigs and dirt for lack of ink and pen. She'd sew ugly ragdolls from whatever scrap material she could get her hands on.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 12.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' This was her only source of happiness in life. But it was all she needed, and she was content... until the world decided that even this was too good for her.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 13.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Once again, she was betrayed, and this time everything was taken from her. She felt like life was a miry pit that dragged her further down the more she struggled to escape. At that tender age, she should have been happy... Instead, she stood in the shadows and watched with envy as all good things in the world passed her by.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 14.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' This was a fate too cruel for anyone to bear. Her pain became a breeding ground for dark thoughts, thoughts which festered and grew into a twisted solution to her troubles:
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 15.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' "I detest the happiness of others in all its forms alike."
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 16.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' "I will rob them of everything they hold to be good and true, and it will fill the void in my soul."
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's some pretty heavy stuff...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Now it all makes sense.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 17.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Does this story satisfy you, Lyney?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, it is quite to my tastes. Thank you for helping to clear up my confusion.
:{{DIcon}} So what was with the warning letter?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that's right. What drove you to write that letter, Jemma? What were you trying to achieve there?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cause without that, none of this ever would have come to light...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' She didn't write the letter.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 18.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' After ten long years, I'd hoped that The Phantom Weasel would be consigned to the history books by now. But it seems like someone still wasn't ready to let her finally be at peace.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 19.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Lyney... Or should I call you The Phantom Copycat now? You were the one who posted that letter outside the opera house. But why?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Very sharp, Phantom Weasel. Still as shrewd as ever.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, no need for me to be coy about it. Our goal was to clear Cesar's name.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 22.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The most straightforward way to change the public's impression of Cesar was to force The Weasel to show themselves.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 20.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' That's it? You had no other agenda?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 23.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course we did. We made it quite clear in the letter, I believe? "I shall take from you that which you hold most dear, just as you did to me ten years ago."
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 21.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Ten years ago...? You mean Cesar's death? You... met him?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 22.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Wait... Oh, I get it! You were those two obnoxious kids! It's been so long, and you're all grown up now... I didn't recognize you.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 23.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' He taught you magic back then, didn't he? For what, ten days or something?&nbsp;...And you went to all this trouble... why, because you feel like you still owe him something?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 24.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We remember all our debts, however great or small.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 25.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ten years ago, Cesar's reputation was torn to shreds and his legacy was thrown out. Ten years on, and no one cares what the truth is anymore.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 26.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But we did not forget, and so we came to find you.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 24.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' And? What exactly did you take from me? I'm still standing, as you can see. Lorenzo has admitted to everything &mdash; I'm free.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 27.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Free"?&nbsp;...Do you really think so?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 28.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Cesar once told me that even though the world is filled with lies and falsehoods, we must find our own truth.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 29.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I think that applies to you, too. Truth can take many forms &mdash; prized possessions with nostalgic value, fervent hopes and dreams... and irreplaceable people.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 30.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Life took many things from you, and those wounds never healed. When they ached unbearably in the dead of night, stealing became your way of numbing the pain.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 25.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' What are you trying to say?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 31.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm saying that for the last ten years, you've been living a rather uneventful life. Perhaps that's because you've found something other than a life of crime to fill the hole?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 32.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Back to Lorenzo for a second: He murdered his own master, played along with your act, and took pains to make sure any suspicion would be directed towards him. But what did he have to gain from all that?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 33.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' He knew who you were and the things you'd done, and despite that, he was willing to give everything up for your sake. He's the reason that you haven't felt the compulsion to steal in all these years.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 34.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You're more than just accomplices in murder &mdash; you're the only real friends each other has. So I think you know, deep down, that he is the only "truth" you have in your life.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 35.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But that truth is gone now. And I guarantee you, you'll never see it again.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 26.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' ...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Congratulations on your freedom, Jemma.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 36.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Your freedom will cost you dearly. From now on, you'll be all alone in a world full of lies and falsehoods. I do hope you'll be able to bear it &mdash; you've still got a long life ahead of you, after all.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 roberthoudin 01.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' Gather 'round, one and all, the time has now come for the amazing Lyney to perform his final act in tonight's show!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 roberthoudin 02.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' I'm sure you're all wondering what he has planned for the grand finale? Well, wonder no more, for the answer is... A death-defying high-altitude escape!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A high-altitude escape!?
:{{DIcon}} Ten years ago...
:{{DIcon}} The trick that Cesar died attempting...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 roberthoudin 03.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' I'm sure you all remember the magician Cesar. This was the very trick that led to his fatal fall, after which he was dubbed The Phantom Weasel.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 roberthoudin 04.ogg}} '''Robert Houdin:''' But we have now learned that Cesar was wrongly accused, and that the real Weasel has now confessed to their crimes...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 37.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Guess that's my cue to leave. Whew... I've been practicing this one for ages now, but I'm still a little nervous.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 38.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, I hope you enjoy the rest of the show. There may be a lot of people watching tonight, but you alone are my true witnesses.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 27.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Lyney, wait.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 28.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' You two hid a lot from Cesar &mdash; he went to his grave without ever knowing your secrets. So what about now? Are you an open book &mdash; or are you still the same as ever?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 29.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' You don't have to tell lies to end up isolated and alone. One day, you'll end up exactly where I am today &mdash; maybe then you'll finally understand.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lyney 39.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You're wrong. I'm nothing like you.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 gemma 30.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' ...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, uh... What are we, uh... doing now?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Like Lyney said &mdash; when you're ready, let's head outside and watch the show.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But what about Jemma...?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 2 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' She'll figure out what's best for her soon enough. Oh &mdash; and if you'd like to see Lyney after the show... You know where he'll be. The usual haunt.

:{{A|vo dialog lnlq003 gemma 02.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Sometimes, I think I'm like a gambling addict... All I care about is winning, and it doesn't matter what's at stake.

::'''Lynette:''' It's alright. We're used to that
::'''Lyney:''' We're sorry. You've taught us so much
::'''Lyney:''' But we can't tell you the whole truth
::'''Cesar:''' It's okay. Do you still remember what I told you?
::'''Cesar:''' This world is full of lies and falsehoods
::'''Cesar:''' I only hope that one day, you can find your own truth...
::'''Lyney:''' What about you?
::'''Lyney:''' Have you found your truth?
::'''Cesar:''' Magic is my truth
::'''Cesar:''' I want to perform a magic trick so great
::'''Cesar:''' That people will always think of me
::'''Cesar:''' When they talk about it
::'''Cesar:''' For a magician

:{{A|vo lnlq003 3 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Cesar's name has finally been cleared, and Fontaine's new star magician, Lyney, has fulfilled a wish on his behalf... Ah, I couldn't ask for a better grand finale. It will make a great headline for The Steambird tomorrow, even if I do say so myself!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... Looks like everyone really loved Lyney's grand finale!
:{{DIcon}} Even though they don't know the full story...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't see Lyney anywhere. Where'd he go?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Lynette said he'd be waiting for us at the "usual haunt"... But, um... Where is that?
:{{DIcon}} The cemetery...?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean the one where Cesar's buried?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's probably it. This whole magic show kinda seemed like Lyney's way of saying goodbye to Cesar. So it makes sense that that's where he'd be afterward.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's go look for him there!

{{Quest Description|update|At the place where Cesar fell to his death, Lyney performed the same trick that the deceased magician failed to complete ten years ago. You wonder what's on Lyney mind right now...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Lyney at Cesar's grave)
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney, there you are!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you alright? Paimon was scared to death when the chain broke... Paimon was sure something had gone horribly wrong.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Magic is a performance art. A magician has to get creative to keep the audience on tenterhooks &mdash; that's our job. So I tweaked Cesar's original setup a little to keep it fresh.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I was honestly a little nervous during the live performance. The thought of falling, suddenly feeling weightless, seeing the sky and the ground spinning and spinning...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Sometimes, I can't help but wonder what Cesar thought in those final moments.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Did he regret taking Jemma and Lorenzo on? Or... Did he believe that it was his own slip-up right until the end?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know... Paimon's been wanting to ask you about something ever since we were in Cesar's workshop. You learned magic from Cesar once, didn't you? When was that?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' After I joined the House of the Hearth. To be honest, Lynette and I had an agenda when we approached him.
:{{DIcon}} An agenda?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I told you about my past before, remember? As a young boy, I survived by secretly learning magic from street performers. I'd watch their tricks and try to figure out how they were done.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But I quickly realized that observation alone could only get me so far. What I saw was the polished final performance, but the rigorous training they put in behind the scenes remained invisible to me.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I needed to learn how to improve my sleight of hand, hone my misdirection skills, and make niftier props...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We were gifted enough that we'd made some progress by ourselves. But without proper guidance from a professional magician, we quickly plateaued.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's why you sought Cesar out?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes. We figured there was no harm in asking &mdash; but it took us by surprise that he was so willing to teach us.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' In all, we only spent ten short days together, but he was very good to us. By contrast, we hid so many things from him...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' For instance, when he asked why I wanted to learn magic... I answered "It's my passion."
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But in truth, there was already a lot more to the story by then. After being taken in by an aristocrat for our magic talent, then betrayed soon after... This was no longer about me doing what I loved.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' What amazed me was how the lie escaped my lips even as I was hesitating over whether to tell him the truth.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Trust is a beautiful thing. Sadly, I'd forgotten how to trust by then.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney...
:{{DIcon}} I don't blame you.
:{{DIcon}} That wasn't your fault.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Still worried about the way I feel? You really are a gentle soul, aren't you?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But don't worry, I'm used to it now. From the mansions of the elite to the House of the Hearth, lies and selfishness have followed me and Lynette everywhere we go.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' After Cesar went on tour, we became busy with our missions. The next we heard of him was that he'd fallen to his death and was now declared to be The Phantom Weasel...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That night, I remembered his smile... But as I lay there, I didn't know what to say to him.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' To keep secrets is to put up walls. The longer you keep them up, the less you let people in. Then one day, you look around and realize your life is like an empty auditorium after a show &mdash; full of seats once occupied by all the people who left... But I guess that's the price we have to pay.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You only realize how much someone really meant to you when you lose them completely. That's why I was so confident this would hurt Jemma... because I've felt it for myself.
:{{DIcon}} Don't be sad.
:{{DIcon}} We're in your "auditorium," and we're not going anywhere.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. Cheer up, Lyney.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've had to say our fair share of goodbyes during our journey, too... But whatever happens, Paimon always believes in what tomorrow brings.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Delicious food, fun toys, and {{Traveler}} by my side... Paimon just needs to focus on things like this, and all the unhappy stuff goes right out the window.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know, {{Traveler}}... Doesn't that kinda make you Paimon's "truth"?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 22.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Exactly. It's the same for me and Lynette &mdash; we are the truest thing each other has in the world, and nothing can replace that.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 23.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Life has taken plenty from us, like it did from Jemma. But at least it left us with each other. That's what gave us the strength to get through the darkest days.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 24.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's why the darkness never consumed me, and why it never will. Maybe we live in the shadows too, but we remember every precious ray of light that shines through.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 25.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright, time to lighten this conversation up a little! What did you think of the show tonight? Were you happy with it?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It was amazing! Paimon just wishes we hadn't been so distracted with the Jemma situation... We spent most of our time in the opera house just talking, and pretty much missed the entire first half of the show.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, Lyney... Could you do just one more trick for us?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 26.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Whoa, that's a bit of a tall order I'm afraid. The show's just finished, so my sleeves are decidedly card-free right now...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, c'mon... Surely you can think of something! The Lyney Paimon knows can do anything if he puts his mind to it!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 27.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh, alright then. I'll give it a go &mdash; but only because it's you.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 28.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Watch closely. I have a flower in my hand...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You liar! There's nothing in your hand! We ain't going along with this!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 29.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Huh? My goodness, you're right! But I could've sworn I brought one here with me... Okay, try this. Count down with me: Three, two, one...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Three, two, one!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 30.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Now have another look around &mdash; maybe the flower's appeared somewhere else.
:;(A Rainbow Rose has appeared on the Traveler's chest)
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Let's see...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, there it is! This is a different flower from the one last time, right? This one's called... oh yeah, a Rainbow Rose!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But more importantly &mdash; Paimon has to know how the trick is done! Please, Lyney, pretty please?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 31.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, if you want to learn magic, you'll have to start by addressing me as "Teacher"...
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Fine, pleeease, Teacher, please!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 32.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' *sigh* Since you asked so nicely... I'll share one little tip with you. Namely, the student of magic cannot solely rely on others being prepared to reveal their secrets. You have to observe, think, and find the answers for yourself.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Is that it!?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 33.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, look at the time &mdash; we shouldn't linger here too long. Thanks again for coming to see my show. I bid you both good night!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 lyney 34.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I look forward to seeing you again.
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, fine... See ya!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shall we head back now too?
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon can't wait to read The Steambird tomorrow. Paimon bets Lyney and Cesar will be plastered all over it!
:{{A|vo lnlq003 4 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head to The Steambird's offices tomorrow morning and see what we can find out!
