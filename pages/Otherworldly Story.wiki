==Description==
A mediocre work of fiction telling the tale of an ordinary fellow who finds himself in another world after death.<br />
The world is filled with dangers. Steel monsters as vast as galaxies lurk beneath the ground and devour people in the thousands.<br />
But there also exists a powerful being who can make the room comfortable in any season and turn night into day with a snap of his fingers. This is a story as groundless as it is meaningless.<br />
It only shares one thing in common with the real world: all the precious metals are owned by a handful of individuals, who keep them locked up in safe boxes.
