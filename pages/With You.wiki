;(Go to Amakane Island)
:{{A|vo aylq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here! But it doesn't seem as lively as Paimon imagined... What's going on?
:{{A|vo aylq005 2 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Since it's the final day, many of the visitors must have already returned home.
:{{A|vo aylq005 2 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I've heard that the peddlers often close up shop earlier on the last day because there are fewer people around.
:{{DIcon}} Are we too late?
:{{A|vo aylq005 2 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Hmm... I'll go and ask. Whatever happens, I at least need to go inside, just this once. Hm!
:{{A|vo aylq005 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the way to go! We'll be right there with you.

;(At the front of mask stall)
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' It hasn't closed yet, it's just that there aren't many people left... Let's hurry and see as much as we can!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look at that stall! They have so many masks!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's <!--This should be read as Paimon has--> heard that everyone's supposed to wear a mask at these kinds of festivals. Is that rule still around nowadays, or...?
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' That used to be the custom, yes, and today, it's still a popular way to dress up during festivals. But it's not a hard-and-fast rule.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 01.ogg}} '''[[Sanden]]:''' Hey! Isn't that Miss Kamisato?
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh! Uh... Ahem. Greetings.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' People seem to recognize Ayaka whenever we go! Guess that's just what it's like when you're a famous Inazuman...
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 02.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Hahaha, but of course! The Kamisato Clan leads the Yashiro Commission. It's one of the most well-known clans in Inazuma.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 03.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Not least because back when Master and Miss Kamisato had just taken over the family's affairs, they used to make public appearances all the time.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 04.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Some of the younger generations have never even seen Miss Kamisato in person before. Being the age I am &mdash; I'm lucky enough to have seen her on many occasions over the years.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' You're too kind. My brother and I simply go where we must fulfill our duties.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 05.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Haha, but this is the first time I've seen anyone from your family at a festival. There must be some official business, I take it?
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh, there isn't, actually. Today, I'm taking my traveler friend here around to see the sights.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 06.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Oh? A traveler? Huh, now that you mention it... You do look like you've come a long way to get here!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 07.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' First time in Inazuma? Hope you enjoy yourself, young one.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 08.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Ah&mdash; excuse me one second.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 09.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Hey, everyone! Listen up! Don't close up yet! Miss Kamisato has come to join the festival!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' N&mdash;No, it's not like that!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Please, there's no need to make a fuss, we're just here to&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Thank you!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, thanks a lot mister! If you hadn't let them know, they'd start closing down about now, right?
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' At least, it sure looks like that time of day.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 10.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Haha, yep, you got it! But on account of this being the first time Miss Kamisato has ever come to the festival, it seems only fair to keep things open a little bit longer!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 11.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Oh &mdash; here's a couple of masks for you. On the house.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' No no no no no, you've been far too accommodating to us already, we couldn't possibly&mdash;
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 12.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Ah, don't gimme all that! Here you go!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 13.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' It's not often that we regular folks get some attention from the Yashiro Commission, so I've gotta mark the occasion somehow! Besides, it'll make me look bad if you refuse, haha.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But...
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...Okay, I... think I understand.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for your generosity, sir.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 14.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Hahaha, it's my pleasure! You have yourself a good time.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sir, do you have anything for Paimon?
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 15.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Ooh, hello there kiddo, um... I'm sorry, but we don't have any masks in your size.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? ...Surely you're not gonna let Paimon be the only one at the festival without a mask?
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' *chuckle* Paimon, don't worry, wearing a mask is optional...
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, but... Paimon doesn't wanna feel left out!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 16.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' How about... a tree leaf? That should be enough to cover up that little face of yours.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? No way!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 17.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Ooh, okay then... Hmm, in that case, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do right now... But don't you worry, kiddo, I'll have a mini mask made specially for you when I get back.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 13.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I cannot thank you enough.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 santa 18.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Ah, it's nothing! But I won't hold you up any longer &mdash; you should go and enjoy the festival while everything's still lit up.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 14.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Alright! Traveler, shall we?
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 15.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh, wait! Um... Just one thing...
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 16.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I need to explain myself. I got a little nervous back there and... I&mdash;I just made up any old excuse. But don't think of this as me taking you sight-seeing, please!
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 17.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I brought you here because... because I genuinely wanted to spend time with you.
:{{DIcon}} I sensed that.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, Ayaka, no misunderstanding here.
:{{A|vo aylq005 3 ayaka 18.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...Okay, great!

;(Talk to Sanden)
:{{A|vo dialog aylq005 santa 01.ogg}} '''Sanden:''' Have fun!

;(At the front of fortune slip stall)
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Traveler, look, this stall's doing fortune slips.
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 shimizu 01.ogg}} '''[[Shimizu]]:''' Miss Kamisato, hello there! You're out with friends today? What a rare privilege &mdash; welcome, welcome! Would you like to give it a go?
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Okay! How much is it per draw?
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 shimizu 02.ogg}} '''Shimizu:''' Hehehe, I wouldn't expect you to know this, but the Yashiro Commission was very good to my uncle on my father's side at one point in time. Thinking about it, it was when your father was around, I think he dealt with it personally.
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 shimizu 03.ogg}} '''Shimizu:''' So you see? How could I possibly take your money?
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' What? A&mdash;Are you sure?
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 shimizu 04.ogg}} '''Shimizu:''' Of course! If you like what you see, then please, be my guest. Same goes for your two friends here.
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Traveler, Paimon... What do you think?
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems like everyone wants to do something nice for Ayaka! So if they insist... who are we to resist!
:{{DIcon}} If they're offering, who are we to refuse?
:{{DIcon}} I'm enjoying being a VIP by association!
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Well, if that's how you feel, then... okay! We'll take you up on your kind offer, sir! Let's each do a draw.
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 shimizu 05.ogg}} '''Shimizu:''' Alrighty then! Whenever you're ready.

:{{A|vo aylq005 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Which one did you get? Paimon got "Rising Fortune."
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' No way, we got the same one!
:{{A|vo aylq005 4 ayaka 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Traveler, what did you get?
:{{DIcon}} Mine says "Great Fortune (From Heaven/From the World/Among People)."

:{{A|vo aylq005 5 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Hahaha, of course it is.
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, but we don't want anything to go to waste. Let's try them one at a time.
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ayaka, Paimon wants those Dango!
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Sure!

:{{A|vo aylq005 5 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I don't know if it's rude of me to ask, but how is this kind of snack actually made?
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 murakami 03.ogg}} '''Murakami:''' Haha, you wanna try your hand at making it yourself? No problem, just give me a second and I'll write out the recipe for you.
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A new recipe!
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' A&mdash;Are you sure about this? If you share the recipe... isn't that tantamount to giving away your secrets... or something?
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 murakami 04.ogg}} '''Murakami:''' Well, it was you who gave Kiminami Restaurant that recipe for an overseas dish, wasn't it?
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 murakami 05.ogg}} '''Murakami:''' Hehe, she and I are good friends. We trade culinary tips all the time.
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 murakami 06.ogg}} '''Murakami:''' Here you go, just treat it as me returning a favor on behalf of my friend.

:{{DIcon}} Thanks, boss!
:{{A|vo aylq005 5 murakami 08.ogg}} '''Murakami:''' There's no greater feeling than creating delicious food with your own two hands. You should definitely give it a try.

:{{A|vo aylq005 5 ayaka 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Once I've learned how to make it... will you two be my taste testers?

:{{DIcon}} Looking forward to it already.

;(At the front of Prayer Rack)
:{{A|vo aylq005 6 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' This stall sells Prayer Plaques. It's an Inazuman tradition &mdash; you draw your wish onto a pentagonal piece of wood called a Prayer Plaque and pray that it will come true.
:{{A|vo aylq005 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds similar to the way people in Liyue release lanterns during Lantern Rite. Those are used for making wishes, too.
:{{A|vo aylq005 6 yoshikawa 01.ogg}} '''[[Yoshikawa]]:''' Oh, welcome! Looking for Prayer Plaques? Every wish is sacred, and you've still got time to make yours before the festival ends!

:{{A|vo aylq005 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait, there's writing and drawing involved? Count Paimon out, then... Paimon's head's feeling kinda fuzzy after eating so much just now... not the best time for an intense burst of mental activity...

:{{A|vo aylq005 6 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo aylq005 6 yoshikawa 03.ogg}} '''Yoshikawa:''' You can either draw a picture to represent your wish or write it out in words. Either way, once you've committed your wish onto your plaque, please hang it onto the Prayer Rack.

:{{A|vo aylq005 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, (Traveler), well, let's see what you got!

:{{A|vo aylq005 6 ayaka 13.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' That's right. I wish for peace and happiness for everyone in Inazuma, and good health for my family and friends.
:{{A|vo aylq005 6 ayaka 14.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' *sigh* I do hope that wish can come true.

:{{DIcon}} Finding (her/him) is the whole reason for my journey.

:{{A|vo aylq005 7 ayaka 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I understand.
:{{A|vo aylq005 7 ayaka 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Family bonds are inseparable &mdash; no one can break them... They are the most important roots we have in this world.

:'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' There's something that... I'd like to do
:'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' If you could spare me yet another moment
:;(Ayaka chuckles and hops into a shallow pool)
:'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Please

:{{A|vo aylq005 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Beautiful, elegant, and... and something else Paimon can't put into words. *thinking* Paimon doesn't really know what it was, but, it is art.
:{{DIcon}} It was delightful.
:{{A|vo aylq005 8 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Phew... I'm not very good at this kind of dance. So as long as I didn't embarrass myself, that's all that matters.

:{{A|vo aylq005 8 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Hahaha... In a way, that sort of sums up today for me. Dancing like nobody's watching.
:{{DIcon}} There's nothing wrong with that.
:{{DIcon}} You're a pleasure to be around!

:{{A|vo aylq005 8 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' That goes for you too.
