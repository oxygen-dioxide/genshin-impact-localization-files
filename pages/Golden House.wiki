The '''Golden House''' is where all of Teyvat's [[Mora]] is minted. When [[Rex Lapis]] died, his corpse, the Exuvia, was moved here by the [[Liyue Qixing]].

Following the events of the {{Quest|A New Star Approaches}}, the Golden House is no longer minting new Mora after the [[Geo Archon]] handed over his [[Gnosis]] to the [[Tsaritsa]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! Zhongli, now that you don't have your Gnosis, what's going to happen to all the Mora in Teyvat?
::'''Paimon:''' Since Morax is "dead," are they all just gonna disappear?
::'''Paimon:''' Also, isn't the Golden House the only mint in the entire continent? Will it even continue to work?
::'''Zhongli:''' The Mora present now will not vanish. But the Golden House will indeed have to cease operations for a lengthy period of time, since creating Mora requires the use of the Geo Archon's power.
::'''Paimon:''' Argh! This is terrible. We're all about to run out of Mora! The world is coming to an end!
::'''Zhongli:''' Yes, this is indeed a major issue from a financial standpoint...
::'''Zhongli:''' Uh.. Well. I suppose we'll just leave such troublesome matters to the Liyue Qixing to debate.
