'''Rockin' in a Flaming World''' is [[Xinyan]]'s [[Level 6 Constellation]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The wording on this Constellation is a bit misleading as it implies that only her Charged Attacks get the bonus. This is not the case. Instead, it works by converting 50% of Xinyan's current DEF into a straight ATK bonus while she's in her Charged Attack animation. Since Xinyan’s Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst apply instances of Damage over Time that can hit during her Charged Attack animation, they can benefit from the ATK buff.
