;(Talk to Arapacati)
:'''Arapacati:''' Oh! If it isn't the Golden Nara! Alas...
:'''Arama:''' [[Arapacati]] not afraid. Nara (Traveler) is good Nara, just like the Nara in the stories. Nara (Traveler) and Paimon have helped us a lot.
:'''Arapacati:''' Okay, Arapacati not afraid. Arapacati trusts [[Arama]], and the grass, leaves, and seeds. All say you're a good Nara. Hello, Nara (Traveler) and Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, Arapacati!
:{{DIcon}} Actually... I'm bad.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't make that kind of joke!
::'''Arapacati:''' You good. Arapacati knows.
::'''Arapacati:''' Lots of winds bring lots of small seeds. They come to [[Vanarana]] with Nara. They say Nara (Traveler) is nice.
::'''Paimon:''' Arama said something like that too! Speaking of which, seeds brought by winds... You mean like dandelion seeds?
::{{DIcon}} Or Windwheel Aster seeds?
::{{DIcon}} Or maybe pinecones?
::{{DIcon}} Did the winds bring the seeds of those stories...?
:::'''Paimon:''' ?
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:'''Arama:''' Nara (Traveler) is going to help Arana to form a [[Bija]]. So, we will prepare for [[Festival Utsava]] together.
:'''Arapacati:''' Oh, Festival Utsava...
:'''Arama:''' Arapacati looks strange. Is anything troubling you?
:'''Arapacati:''' Arapacati's big brothers have not returned to Vanarana. We siblings can't celebrate Festival Utsava together if they don't return...
:'''Arama:''' I haven't seen [[Arachatora]], [[Arasaka]], [[Arapas]], and [[Araphala]] in Vanarana for a very long time either. Never seen them after that incident.
:'''Paimon:''' A very long time... How long is that?
:'''Arapacati:''' Many, many moons ago, when the seedlings had just sprouted. But now they are already big trees, big enough to keep the rain off Aranara! It's seven Arapacatis tall!
:'''Paimon:''' From seedlings to trees! Wow! That's a really long time! Are your brothers missing, Arapacati?
:'''Arapacati:''' Missing? Is that a type of seed?
:'''Arama:''' Ooh! So Nara seeds are called Missing? Amazing!
:'''Arapacati:''' Nara are amazing! Nara (Traveler) must have many Missings.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, that's not what we mean...
:{{DIcon}} It means you don't know where they are.
:{{DIcon}} I know what that feels like...
::'''Arapacati:''' Nara (Traveler) understands how I feel?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, (Traveler) has a lost {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}} too...
::'''Arapacati:''' Oh. Nara (Traveler), is your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}} also doing cooking training?
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon thinks there's been a misunderstanding... Missing means you don't know where something has gone!
:'''Arapacati:''' Oh, not that. Arapacati knows big brothers not missing. They go for training outside Vanarana for a long, long time. Cooking training.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, cooking training. Paimon gets it...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like something Paimon would be interested in...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm! Paimon is more interested in (Traveler)'s cooking training!
:'''Paimon:''' So, what is this cooking training exactly...
:'''Arama:''' It happened in the last Festival Utsava. Nara made lots of food for Aranara to try.
:'''Arapacati:''' So, to make food for Nara in return in this Festival Utsava, Arachatora and the others have been taking cooking training.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't wait any longer for this Festival Utsava!
:{{DIcon}} But that's Aranara's food...
::'''Paimon:''' Delicious food is the common language of all living creatures! It'll be fine!
:{{DIcon}} Can't wait!
:'''Paimon:''' But Arapacati, since you know where they are, why don't you search for them yourself?
:'''Arapacati:''' The magnificent Festival Utsava is about to begin. Arapacati has lots to prepare. No time to search for them.
:'''Arapacati:''' They left Vanarana for cooking training to prepare for Festival Utsava. But they don't know Festival Utsava is about to start! Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala stupid.
:'''Paimon:''' Then leave it to us! We'll be going with Arama to find the Aranara in the forest and prepare for Festival Utsava anyway. Isn't that right, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to us.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:'''Paimon:''' But how will we find Arachatora, Ara... What were the other names again?
:'''Arapacati:''' Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala.
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh! [[Arana]], Arama, [[Araja]], Arapacati... Aranara names are so hard to remember!
:'''Arama:''' Paimon, don't say that about Aranara names. You're gonna make the Aranara sad.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, okay. So, how do we find them?
:'''Arama:''' They used to do cooking training in Vanarana. But they made lots of smoke, so Arapacati kicked them out.
:'''Arapacati:''' Everyone was so scared then. Some Aranara even hibernated. Luckily, Arama was brave and punished the smoke. Arapacati was furious and made them leave.
:'''Arapacati:''' So, you should be able to find them in the forest by looking for {{color|buzzword|the rising pillars of smoke}}, I think.
:'''Paimon:''' So you kicked them out!
:'''Arapacati:''' Yes. Did I make a mistake?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, not really... Anyway, (Traveler), let's get going!
:'''Arapacati:''' Oh, right. One more thing. If my brothers are acting strange, go splat them with {{color|buzzword|the power of Dendro}}.
:'''Arapacati:''' In the past, they created lots and lots of smoke. Filled all of Vanarana with smoke. They were afraid too and ran around everywhere. Sometimes they also became like that if they touched strange mushrooms.
:'''Arapacati:''' But Aranara are spirits of the forest. So, we can recover and regain our senses by absorbing {{color|buzzword|the power of Dendro}}.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it now. By that logic, (Traveler) recovers after eating Sweet Madame, so (Traveler) must be a Sweet Madame spirit. Yes! This makes perfect sense.
:{{DIcon}} ?
::'''Arama:''' ?
::'''Arapacati:''' ?
::'''Paimon:''' ...Aaaanyway, let's go!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, yeah, let's go.
:'''Arama:''' Good luck, Nara (Traveler)! Good luck, Paimon!

;(Talk to Arapacati again)
:'''Arapacati:''' ...So difficult to talk to Nara, and they are so tall.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:'''Arapacati:''' Eek! It's Nara (Traveler)...
:'''Arapacati:''' Arapacati not scared. Brothers are very brave, so they definitely not scared too.
:'''Arapacati:''' You should find them if you move towards {{color|buzzword|the pillars of smoke}}. If they are acting strange, go splat them with {{color|buzzword|the power of Dendro}}.
