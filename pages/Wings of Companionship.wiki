==Lore==
Not all wings have the chance to fly.<br>
There are birds in this world who have never learned to fly.<br>
There are also some wind gliders that have never gone through quality assurance...

Looking at your thoughtful expression, [[Marjorie|she]] seemed to have understood your concerns.<br>
"Don't worry! No one's ever been hurt while testing a wind glider"<br>
She continued on to explain that the only ones hurt had been [[Forest Boar|wild boars]] and [[hilichurl]]s.<br>
Even so, you felt just a bit sorry those little lives who had been harmed so you may soar over the land...<br>
But you were slightly relieved, at least.

She went on to say:<br>
"The ability of wind gliders to glide is reliant first and foremost on the blessing of the [[Anemo Archon]]."<br>
"Of course, it's also been intertwined with human engineering..."

Though she never elaborated as to why she was collecting [[Anemo Sigil]]s,<br>
But perhaps because she was someone with an adventurer's blood and a merchant's heart,<br>
She would grow exceedingly talkative when mentioning people who had an adventurous spirit.<br>
According to her, explorers had already begun experimenting with gliding devices thousands of years ago.

You clear your throat lightly, and she, a little abashed, continued to explain just what was so special about this wind glider.<br>
Some suspected that it might be too unusual to receive the Anemo Archon's blessing.<br>
And because the craftsman had that small amount of courage, they were also mocked by all, just like their beautiful creation.<br>
It truly was unfair...

But you are also a brave person, are you not? One who does not concede to the views of the world. You'd make a good match for this pair of wings for sure.<br>
&mdash;So saying, she places a completely unique wind glider in your hands.<br>
"Of course it can fly, and of course it will carry you. But you must first believe in it &mdash; and believe in the you that believes in it."
