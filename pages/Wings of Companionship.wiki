==Lore==
Not all wings have the chance to fly.<br />
There are birds in this world who have never learned to fly.<br />
There are also some wind gliders that have never gone through quality assurance...

Looking at your thoughtful expression, she seemed to have understood your concerns.<br />
"Don't worry! No one's ever been hurt while testing a wind glider"<br />
She continued on to explain that the only ones hurt had been wild boars and hilichurls.<br />
Even so, you felt just a bit sorry those little lives who had been harmed so you may soar over the land...<br />
But you were slightly relieved, at least.

She went on to say:<br />
"The ability of wind gliders to glide is reliant first and foremost on the blessing of the Anemo Archon."<br />
"Of course, it's also been intertwined with human engineering..."

Though she never elaborated as to why she was collecting Anemo Sigils,<br />
But perhaps because she was someone with an adventurer's blood and a merchant's heart,<br />
She would grow exceedingly talkative when mentioning people who had an adventurous spirit.<br />
According to her, explorers had already begun experimenting with gliding devices thousands of years ago.

You clear your throat lightly, and she, a little abashed, continued to explain just what was so special about this wind glider.<br />
Some suspected that it might be too unusual to receive the Anemo Archon's blessing.<br />
And because the craftsman had that small amount of courage, they were also mocked by all, just like their beautiful creation.<br />
It truly was unfair...

But you are also a brave person, are you not? One who does not concede to the views of the world. You'd make a good match for this pair of wings for sure.<br />
&mdash;So saying, she places a completely unique wind glider in your hands.<br />
"Of course it can fly, and of course it will carry you. But you must first believe in it &mdash; and believe in the you that believes in it."
