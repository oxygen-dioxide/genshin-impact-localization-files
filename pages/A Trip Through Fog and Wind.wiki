'''''A Trip Through Fog and Wind''''' is an Event Quest that occurs in [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] during the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event.

==Steps==
Start the quest by finding the journal [[Illegible Notes]] inside the cave in [[Twinning Isle/1.6|Twinning Isle]].
#According to the journal, you can pierce through the fog in the middle of the day (10{{colon}}00 - 14{{colon}}00)
#Look around
#*The quest completes when you observe the mural

==Gameplay Notes==
* The [[Twinning Isle Mural]] also hints at the location of the journal.
* The starting location is the northeast cave island that is closer to Twinning Isle.
* Follow the wind to reach the island. Deviating from the route leads to the [[Climate#Sea Fog|Sea Fog]] effect for a few seconds, and if the player does not return to the route, the screen blacks out with a message saying "You have lost your way amidst the mist." Players will respawn at the starting location.
** If the time goes past 14{{colon}}00 while the player is still navigating, they can pause and adjust the time again.
** There will be [[whirlpool]]s along the way.
* There are 3 [[Chests|Precious Chests]] and 2 Common Chests on the Nameless Islet.
* The fog does not lift after quest completion. To reach the Nameless Islet again, players must navigate the fog again as they did during this quest.
* The Nameless Islet Mural also advances the quest ''[[The Other Side of Isle and Sea]]''.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Following information on the mural, you discover a hidden location on Twinning Isle and the journal left there. The journal states that if you want to break through the fog around the island, you need to set out from a certain point on the island's northeasterly section at noon and follow the wind...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Interact with the Illegible Notes)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon never thought that there'd be a place like this here...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? There's a journal here, too... Let's see what it says.
::'''Illegible Notes'''<br />"If we wish to leave this place, we have to find a way to break through this fog, somehow..."<br />"Who knew that such a sight could be seen on that rock to the northwest. I'd love to bring her to see it too. I think it happened at... around 11{{colon}}00?"<br />"A short-lived gap sometimes appears in the fog over the northeasterly island. Who knows, we might be able to use this to leave these islands..."<br />"...The wind, that's right! If we could use the wind, we might be able to charge through. But the wind direction in this part of the sea is very strange. We have to get the timing right. Perhaps the wind at around 12{{colon}}00 might be more suitable..."
:'''Paimon:''' It says that there will be a gap in the fog around the northern island at noon...
:'''Paimon:''' Well then, why don't we do as the journal says and visit that northern island at noon?
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe we'll find something new...
:;(Obtain [[Illegible Notes]] ×1)

;(Upon reaching the start point between 10{{colon}}00 and 14{{colon}}00)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, the wind really picked up... Come on, let's follow it.

;(Upon following the wind trail through a rock)
:'''Paimon:''' This rock disappeared. Wh&mdash;What in the world happened...

;(Upon reaching the island)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like the fog's finally behind us... But Paimon never thought there'd be another island here...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's keep on our guard as we have a look around.

;(Observe the mural)
:''<small>(If this is the first mural you've found)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Look, there' some sort of... drawing on this stone.
::'''Paimon:''' It looks like people are getting ready to board a ship.
::<small>(Starts [[The Other Side of Isle and Sea]])</small>''
:''<small>(Otherwise)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon didn't think we'd find a mural here, too...
::'''Paimon:''' It looks like it shows people getting ready to board a ship.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't know what all this means, but let's record this mural down first.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* During the next iteration of the Golden Apple Archipelago in [[Version 2.8]], the music is the same, and all mirage rocks are the same. However, the area is missing the wind trail, fog effects when viewed from outside of the area, and all whirlpools. In addition, the visual fog effects were changed to be heavier and darker. There is also no climate or other Special Environment affecting the area, and players can navigate the area freely.
** During the World Quest ''[[Treasure Clue: Twinning Isle]]'' in Version 2.8, there is a raven who guides the player through the fog. (It is not required to follow the raven's instructions.) The route is slightly different but mostly the same as the route in ''A Trip Through Fog and Wind''.
