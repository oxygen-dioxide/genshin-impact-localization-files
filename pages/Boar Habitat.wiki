'''Boar Habitat''' is an area notable for its unusually high number of [[Forest Boar]]s. Following the path out of the entrance to [[Stormterror's Lair]], marked by the worn dirt and crumbled pillars in the [[Decarabian's Mondstadt#Architecture and Design|Decarabian style]], eventually leads to a field naturally enclosed by ridges. 

At the center of the field is a wooden {{w|bell-cot}}. Its architectural style does not match that of the ruins in the area and instead uses a roofing style seen on houses in [[Springvale]], which are built in the traditional [[Classic Country Home]] style. However, without further details, it is impossible to discern when this structure was built and for what purpose.
