==Profile==
Silver is the younger of [[Navia]]'s two attendants.

During the events of ''[[Deluge of Wrathful Waters]]'', Silver was dissolved by the [[Primordial Sea]] while trying to save other people when the water began flooding Poisson. His consciousness was forged into an [[Oceanid]], where he and [[Melus]] protected Navia from the collective of other Poisson victims after she nearly fell into the water, who wanted to absorb her consciousness. The act was long enough for [[Neuvillette]] to save her from being completely dissolved, where he gave his final farewell to her.

===Appearance===
Silver wore a white shirt under his dark gray suit coat, accented with a navy tie. He wears black pants, gloves, and shoes. His hat is dark with an ochre ribbon. Silver had black sunglasses and dark purple hair.
