==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Osse is a cat that was possessed by [[Cassiodor]] for the duration of the {{Quest|Canticles of Harmony}}. Afterwards, he was taken in by [[Este (Human)|Este]] at the [[Daydream Club]]'s headquarters.

===Appearance===
A white cat with silver tabby stripes, and bicolor eyes. 

Whilst possessed by Cassiodor, he had a visual effect of gold sparkles and blue runes. He notably wore a gold pendant, with a blue diamond shaped charm, which he loses after Cassiodor leaves his body.

==Trivia== 
* Osse is the only Cat NPC that can be pet (in lieu of [[Feline Fortress Furrdyssey]]) without using the [[Throne of Meower]] or [["Throne of Purr-fection"]].

=== Etymology ===
* Paimon's nickname of "Osse" is meant to be a contraction of "Ouranopolis" (from "Ouranides of Ouranopolis," the name which [[Remus]] bestowed [[Cassiodor]] after separating him from [[Phobos]]), which is more apparent in the original Chinese text; {{Zh|'''乌'''兰诺珀里'''斯'''|rm='''Wū'''lánnuòpòlǐ'''sī'''|tl=Ouranopolis}} became {{Zh|小呜斯|rm=Xiǎo Wūsī|tl=Little Ous.}}<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Shadow Over Petrichor|note=Chinese version|quote='''Ouranides of Ouranopolis:''' 居然要从这里开始讲起吗…好吧。吾乃「乌兰诺珀里斯的乌兰依代」，旧日国度的守灵人。<br>'''Paimon:''' 乌…乌…乌什么斯？舌头都要打结了！就叫你「小呜斯」好了，跟猫咪喜欢的「噗嘶噗嘶」声发音也很相近，是个不错的称呼吧？}}</ref>
