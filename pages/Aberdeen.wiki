{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aberdeen:''' If I can just avoid the [[Forest Rangers]]...
:{{DIcon}} What are you planning?
::'''Aberdeen:''' As an adventurer, the greatest plan is of course to travel every inch of the world and explore every secret this world has to offer!
::'''Aberdeen:''' So, based on this goal of mine, I've decided to conquer [[Avidya Forest]] first!
::{{DIcon}} First...
::'''Aberdeen:''' Ahem, what? I admit that I'm a novice, but every novice has to take their first step, right?
::'''Aberdeen:''' I heard cute Fungi live in the rainforest, and there are tiny forest cats and mysterious treasures...
::'''Aberdeen:''' Hehe, it sounds so exciting!
::'''Aberdeen:''' The only obstacle between me and my grand adventure is those annoying Forest Rangers. If I can just avoid them, then I can...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I hope you drop that thought...
:::'''Aberdeen:''' If that's your thought, you are not exactly "adventurous."
:::'''Aberdeen:''' Listen, to be the greatest adventurer, you must be ambitious and ready to take risks.
::;(Obtain [[Wanderer's Advice]] ×6)
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Aberdeen:''' Bye! Maybe our next meeting will be in somewhere else!
