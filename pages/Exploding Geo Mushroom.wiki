'''Exploding Geo Mushrooms''' (''unofficial name'') are objects found in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]]. When approached or attacked, they will explode after a short delay, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. This explosion can also clear certain obstacles that cannot be cleared any other way. Exploding Geo Mushrooms come in small and large sizes, and larger mushrooms deal greater DMG.
