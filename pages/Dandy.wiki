'''Dandy''' is an open-world [[NPC]] who appears simultaneously in four different places, allowing the player to do three timed trials at each location for increasing rewards.

==Race==
If the player talks to Dandy, there will be an option to ''Start time trial challenge'', requiring use of your glider for three out of four of the challenge locations.

The player will need to complete 3 races per track to earn a common, exquisite, and precious [[chest]]. The challenge timer will decrease as the rewards increase after a successful run.

After earning the precious chest, the player cannot earn any more rewards at that location but will be able to redo the challenge to beat their best time.
