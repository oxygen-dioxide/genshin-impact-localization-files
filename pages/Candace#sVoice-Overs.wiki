|vo_08_01_tx         = Perhaps it is a testament to the Dendro Archon's benevolence that I, a descendant of the Al-Ahmar bloodline, am able to live peacefully on this land. If so, I suppose I am grateful for this much, but... I am first and foremost a child of the desert.

|vo_08_02_tx         = An eccentric girl who always seems to be in a trance...? Yes, I believe I've seen her before &mdash; near the [[Wall of Samiel]]. I couldn't make sense of what she was saying, nor the calculations she wrote down, but she seemed to be in a much better mood after she'd finished. Perhaps this is her way of relieving stress.

|vo_09_02_tx         = We are a people whose god is no longer with us. Lies pose no threat to us... the threat we face is the prospect of no tomorrow. The path before us is paved with barbs, there is pain in every step &mdash; yes, we tread forward clinging to a lie, but perhaps... perhaps there is more virtue in this than in selfishly embracing the truth, and death along with it...

|vo_09_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 03.ogg
|vo_09_03_tx         = Even now, there are those who hold on to a belief that the King Deshret will be resurrected. But it's not possible. The past is but grains of sand, scattered to the four winds. The best we can do is to let go, and leave the wind to carry them to their final resting place.
|vo_09_03_mention    = King Deshret

|vo_09_04_tx         = My shield? Well, according to what people outside the village say, it has the blessing of [[Bennu]]. With this shield in hand, all the grains of sand are my eyes and ears, and the desert is ready to do my bidding... Their imaginations can get a little carried away sometimes. But anyway, that aside, the main thing for me is it always works a charm.
|vo_09_04_mention    = Bennu

|vo_10_02_tx         = Every now and then, a few violent thugs make the mistake of trying to disrupt the peace and tranquility of Aaru Village. I do wonder... is chasing them into a monster-infested valley perhaps a little too... merciful? What do you think, do you have any better ideas on how they should be dealt with?

|vo_10_03_title      = Favorite Food
|vo_10_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_03_tx         = To me... quantity is more important than taste when it comes to food. Life in the desert uses up more energy than you might think. After a day's work, there's nothing more satisfying than having a filling meal.

|vo_10_04_title      = Least Favorite Food
|vo_10_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Least Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_04_tx         = I don't hate it, but compared to regular meat, eating fish is a real nuisance... Maybe it's because we don't really eat fish here in the desert, but for whatever reason, I'm just not very good at removing all those prickly little bones... This must sound ridiculous to you.

<!-- Receiving a Gift -->

|vo_10_06_tx         = For someone who spends so much time on the road, your cooking tastes so... homely.

|vo_10_07_title      = Receiving a Gift: III
|vo_10_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} Receiving a Gift - 03.ogg
|vo_10_07_tx         = Maybe my definition of "edible" is a little too old-fashioned...

|vo_11_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Birthday.ogg
|vo_11_01_tx         = Happy birthday! It's amazing to think that you were born on this day, years ago in the past. Do you have a birthday wish? If it involves going somewhere dangerous, let me join you &mdash; I'll be your guard. Or if you're looking to rest and revitalize, come to Aaru Village, and I'll serve you the finest meats and drinks we have.

|vo_12_03_title      = Feelings About Ascension: Climax
|vo_12_03_ascension  = 4
|vo_12_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Feelings About Ascension -  03.ogg
|vo_12_03_tx         = I learned to wield the spear and shield knowing that I would one day need them, and today I use these skills to protect the village. So perhaps this new strength I now gain in the present is preparing me for trials that lie ahead in the future.

|vo_12_04_title      = Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
|vo_12_04_ascension  = 6
|vo_12_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Feelings About Ascension -  04.ogg
