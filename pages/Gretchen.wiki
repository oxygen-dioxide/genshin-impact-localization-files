{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Gretchen:''' Hey, thanks for stopping in... Welcome to the Veluriyam Mirage restaurant. I'm Gretchen. Guess you could say I'm the manager here.
:{{DIcon}} Hello. So this is a restaurant...
::'''Gretchen:''' Yes, please feel free to rest up here for a bit.
::'''Gretchen:''' As this is a lakeside restaurant, you can enjoy breathtaking views of the majestic scenery while enjoying our fine cuisine. You know, I spent quite a lot of time picking the location.
::'''Gretchen:''' You may also notice that the angles at which the tables are arranged, the height and materials of the chairs have been meticulously calibrated.
::'''Gretchen:''' This way, we can provide our guests with a delightful dining experience!
::{{DIcon}} So, what's on the menu?
::{{DIcon}} About the "dining" part of the experience...
::'''Gretchen:''' I recommend our specialty! Though... the dining process can be {{sic|someone}} complicated, as it is part of our restaurant's unique dining etiquette.
::'''Gretchen:''' To begin, you must fetch some water...
::{{DIcon}} For washing my hands, right?
::{{DIcon}} Hygiene should never be neglected.
::'''Gretchen:''' No, you should fill the pot with it. Next, you'll have to add your favorite ingredients...
::'''Gretchen:''' The most important part is the waiting. Close your eyes, and when the delicious aroma rising from the pot greets your nose, you will find that our specialty is ready for your enjoyment.
::{{DIcon}} Huh? Isn't that just making me cook?
::'''Gretchen:''' Whaaat? How did you figure it out so quickly?
::'''Gretchen:''' Hehe, I wanted to become a chef, I just really don't have any talent for cooking... No matter how hard I work on the interior, a restaurant needs to have food.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I'll definitely visit again, five stars!
::'''Gretchen:''' Then I shall look forward to your return, honored guest!
