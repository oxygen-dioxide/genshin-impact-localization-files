|description    = Draws inspiration from the layout of the military buildings and furnishings of the [[Kujou Encampment]]. During the conflict between the [[Shogun's Army]] and the [[Watatsumi Army|resistance]], both sides have sought various ways to improve the quality of their new recruits upon joining their respective armies. Compared with traditional training sites, this type of training ground not only provides all kind of equipment, it also can simulate the urgency of being on the frontline, giving an experience that is very close to the real thing. Naturally, this allows the new recruits to get a sufficient amount of training.
