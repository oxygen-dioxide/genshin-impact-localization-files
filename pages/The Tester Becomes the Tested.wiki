==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|The botanist Vishava is attempting to perform some dangerous experiments on Fungi...}}
===First Encounter===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon quest trigger)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Why are those Fungi gathered over there? ...&nbsp;Wait, there's someone trapped over there! Come on, we've gotta save him!

;(Talk to Vishava)
:'''Vishava:''' Ah, thank you, thank you! I almost thought that I would have sacrificed myself for science &mdash; in the prime of my youth, no less!
:'''Vishava:''' I didn't think that these Fungi would suddenly go on a rampage like that. I need to reformulate my reagent...
:{{DIcon}} Now that you mention it, there's an odd smell in the air...
:'''Vishava:''' Umm, so, about that... I was actually researching how different substances affect the behaviors of Fungi.
:'''Vishava:''' If I could successfully develop a reagent that chases Fungi away, I could make a real killing by selling it to the merchant caravans!
:'''Vishava:''' I might have failed this time, yes, but we got some new experimental data. I shall succeed next time for sure!
:{{DIcon}} Not gonna lie, but it seems like your brew will only make them mad.
:{{DIcon}} There might not be somebody to help you anymore.<!--Needs verifying on the exact wording. I clicked too fast.-->
::'''Vishava:''' That must be because I didn't use enough of it! As long as we add a little more active ingredients, they'll stay away for sure!
::'''Vishava:''' Thanks to you, I was able to obtain this data. It's not much, but please accept this as compensation.
:{{DIcon}} There might not be anyone to save you next time, you know.
::'''Vishava:''' Well, that may be so... But you know, if there are any further incidents... I mean, they say that your body is your primary capital for your research, right?
::'''Vishava:''' Thanks for coming to my rescue! Most of the goods I had on me were lost, but please, take these as compensation...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Subsequent Encounter #1===
<!--also fourth encounter near Vanarana-->
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon quest trigger)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Is that... The researcher we met before? What's he looking at?

;(Vishava's idle quotes before talking to him)
:'''Vishava:''' Help! Help me!
:'''Vishava:''' Somebody help me!

;(Talk to Vishava)
:'''Vishava:''' O&mdash;Oh, hello, l&mdash;look who it is!
:'''Vishava:''' I'm still working on my reagent, but I think some further observation is required &mdash; you know, for safety reasons!
:{{DIcon}} Now that you mention it, there's an odd smell in the air...
:'''Vishava:''' Hmm, that must be the extract I used for my experiments. I was trying a new reagent this time.
:'''Vishava:''' Now, I've made some additional improvements to that reagent based on the data I've gathered from my latest observations. As long as it passes the live trials, it'll be good to go commercially!
:'''Vishava:''' My observations have been long and detailed. Our chances of failure may as well be zero!
:{{DIcon}} You sure your concoction is safe?
::'''Vishava:''' Don't fret, don't fret! I'm very confident in this product. Just watch &mdash; the next time we meet, you'll be talking to a rich man!
::'''Vishava:''' Come, come, take your compensation. It is the least I could do in exchange for your constant aid. Please, do not stand on ceremony.
:{{DIcon}} Will people use something this pungent?
::'''Vishava:''' Huh? Does it still have such a brutally belligerent smell? Hmm, now that you say so, it is quite so! I must've just gotten too used to it...
::'''Vishava:''' Well, it's good that we discovered this early, or we might have some trouble selling it... That said, this can't really be mixed with any food ingredients or spices.
::'''Vishava:''' Looks like I'll just have to use slightly less active ingredients. Thanks for the reminder. Please, take this as a token of my thanks.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Subsequent Encounter #2===
<!--Encounter North of the Chatrakam cave underground waypoint...again-->
<!--this is also the fourth encounter for Chatrakam overworld-->
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon quest trigger)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Why are those Fungi all gathered over there? ...&nbsp;Wait, there's someone trapped over there! Come on, we've gotta save him!

;(Vishava's idle quotes before talking to him)
:'''Vishava:''' Help! Help me!
:'''Vishava:''' Somebody help me!

;(Talk to Vishava)
:'''Vishava:''' Th&mdash;Thanks for your help once again...
:'''Vishava:''' Ah, to think that my reagent didn't work this time either... Where did I go wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Now that you mention it, there's an odd smell in the air...
:'''Vishava:''' Hmm, that must be the extract I used for my experiments. I was trying a new reagent this time.
:'''Vishava:''' A single whiff of it sends Fungi running for the hills &mdash; or rather that's how it should have gone, anyway.
:'''Vishava:''' This was also a failure, but I will succeed next time! Tell you what, I've even come up with my sales pitch!
:{{DIcon}} Not gonna lie, but it seems like your brew will only make them mad.
::'''Vishava:''' That must be because I didn't use enough of it! As long as we add a little more active ingredients, they'll be too intimidated to even get close!
::'''Vishava:''' Thanks to your coming to my rescue, I was able to obtain this data. It's not much, but please accept this as compensation.
:{{DIcon}} There might not be anyone to save you next time, you know.
::'''Vishava:''' Well, that may be so... But you know, if there are any further incidents... I mean, they say that your body is your primary capital for your research, right?
::'''Vishava:''' Thanks for coming to my rescue! Most of the goods I had on me were lost, but please, take these as compensation...
