|text      = I should probably be busy preparing the food and decorations for the birthday gathering right now... but I just learned that some of my new friends are having a hard time, and if I don't lend a hand now, they might have to endure the cold winds and sleep on the streets tonight.

Haha, I won't keep you in suspense. So, when I was out feeding the kittens and puppies this morning, a little cat I hadn't seen before came up to me. I followed it and soon discovered several other poor little creatures hiding in the grass. Luckily, I've made a batch of cat and dog beds before winter, and there's still quite a bit of material left. I should be able to make a few more before nightfall.

Of course, if you, my handy and skilled old friend, could assist me, we could get things done much faster and deliver the new beds and their meals together. They'll be overjoyed for sure!

What do you think? Would you be interested in joining such a special birthday party?
