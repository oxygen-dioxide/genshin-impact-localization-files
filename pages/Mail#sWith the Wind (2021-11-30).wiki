|text    = [[Jean|The Acting Grand Master]] gave me the day off, probably because it was my birthday.

Too bad I wasn't in the mood for drinks, so I opted for a stroll instead.

But you know, going where the wind takes me isn't all that different from what I always do...

Haha, just kidding. Our jobs as [[Knights of Favonius]] can be both thankless and tough.

The opportunity to leave our worries at the door, clear our minds, and just feel the breeze can be a real pick-me-up. So I ended up going a little further out than expected, only to find all these [[Crystalflies]] around me. Well, is it just me, or were they also waiting for the [[Dawn Winery|winery]]'s grapes to turn into fine alcohol?

Either way, I've heard that you're quite fond of shiny little trinkets, so they're all yours.

...All in all, I think I'll refrain from solitary walks in the future.

I'll ask you to come along instead &mdash; it'll be more interesting that way, I trust.
