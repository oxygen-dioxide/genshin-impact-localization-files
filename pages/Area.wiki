'''Areas''' are parts of the map in a particular [[region]]. They are larger than [[cities]] and individual [[subareas]], but smaller than entire regions.

Each area's part of the [[Map]] is unlocked upon activation of the corresponding [[Statue of the Seven]], which also unlocks the [[Expedition]] locations for that area. Once unlocked, the map will provide information on the topography of the area, making it easier to find [[Teleport Waypoints]], [[Bosses]] and [[Domains]].

[[Exploration]] progress is tracked per area.
