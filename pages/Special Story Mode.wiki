'''Special Story Mode''' is a game state during [[Quest]]s that restricts certain actions of players or changes the behavior of certain mechanics. The [[Paimon Menu]] is not accessible while in this mode.

Special Story Mode can sometimes be exited from the top left corner of the screen, similar to exiting [[Domain]]s, and may reset quest progress.

Returning to the quest after leaving Special Story Mode may give a Story Review to remind the player of the current story details.
