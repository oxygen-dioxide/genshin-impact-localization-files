'''Strange Tooth''' is used to produce [[Vitalized Dragontooth]] by extracting vitality at the Dragon's Core located in [[Wyrmrest Valley]], [[Dragonspine]]. 4 Strange Tooth are required to begin the extraction process, and players will receive 4 Vitalized Dragontooth as a result.

Strange Tooth respawns 48 hours after it has been harvested. If some Strange Teeth appear to be missing, one may need to collect the tooth from the dragon heart cavern in Wyrmrest Valley first.
