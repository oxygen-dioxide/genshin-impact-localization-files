::'''Tiger Li:''' If you ever run into any troubles, just come and find me!
::{{DIcon}} Why did you come to Ritou?
::'''Tiger Li:''' Because of my [[Li Xiao|big brother]]! He's a great businessman!
::'''Tiger Li:''' I heard from my parents that he's a very brave man. Brave enough to leave home and venture out to sea alone.
::'''Tiger Li:''' He's my idol, and I wanna be someone like him. That's why I also left home and snuck in here with him.
::'''Tiger Li:''' I really miss my mom, but my brother's still here, so I've gotta stick it out here!
:{{DIcon}} Masked people?

::'''Tiger Li:''' I was on the first big ship that returned to Liyue together with my brother, so I know everyone who was on that ship.
::'''Tiger Li:''' But I've never seen you before, and that means you must've been one of the later ships.
::'''Tiger Li:''' According to our customs, that makes you my junior!
::'''Tiger Li:''' So if you ever run into any troubles, just come and find me!
::{{DIcon}} Your brother?

::'''Tiger Li:''' I heard from our parents that he's a very brave man. Brave enough to leave home and venture out to sea alone.
::'''Tiger Li:''' He's my idol, and I wanna be someone like him. That's why I followed him out to sea in secret!
::'''Tiger Li:''' But since he misses Mom, I decided to come back together with him.
::'''Tiger Li:''' I'm not sure when we'll be able to go out together again...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Tiger Li:''' Seeya!
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Based on the [[Ritou Bulletin Board]] message about a fleet of [[Snezhnaya]]n ships coming into port, the "masked people" Tiger Li refers to are likely the Fatui.
