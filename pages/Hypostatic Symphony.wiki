===Overview===
In the Hypostatic Symphony [[event]], head to a newly appeared [[Domain]] {{DIcon|Hypostatic}} at [[Minlin]], [[Liyue]] and challenge the never-before-seen Pure [[Hypostases]], that have some special abilities compared to those typically encountered in the wild.

Like the [[Spiral Abyss]], this Domain does not consume Resin, but food can be freely consumed and switching between active characters can be done freely on the field before the battle. Entering this Domain also has the additional quirk of refilling the active party to full HP and a fully charged Elemental Burst, except the status is carried over to the overworld. This makes it a convenient stopover during one's travels by entering and exiting the next second. With regards to the [[Battle Pass]], defeating the bosses in this Domain will not count towards boss kill count task, but clearing the Domain will count towards the number of Domains cleared task.

Before you begin the challenge in earnest, you can choose the difficulty level and select certain Variations to accumulate more points. A new challenge will unlock each day, starting with the first day of the event, until the seventh day, by which all the challenges will have been unlocked. Once the event ends, your accumulated points will be cleared, and you will be unable to claim any further rewards. Challenges can be attempted in Single Player or Co-Op Mode.

===Variation Details===
Variations are factors that can influence the intensity of the challenge either way. They also affect the amount of points awarded on completing the challenge. A variety of buffs and debuffs are included. Variations that increase the difficulty increase the points awarded on completion, while those that buff your characters have the opposite effect. At the start of the challenge, you can choose the Variations that suit your desired intensity. The points total of the selected Variations must be greater than 0 to begin the challenge.

Different challenges provide bonuses to different characters. Characters in receipt of a bonus deal 20% extra DMG. In Co-Op Mode, these event bonuses can be shared.

===Points & Rewards Details===
Primogems are awarded the first time you complete a given challenge at any difficulty level.

Points are awarded on completion of a challenge based on the Variations and difficulty selected. Reach point targets to claim the event-exclusive [[namecard]] style "[[Namecard#Celebration: Hypostasis|Celebration: Hypostasis]]" and other rewards.

During the event period, you can repeat challenge stages to improve your high score. Your total score is the sum of your current highest scores across all challenges. Reach score targets to claim rewards.

(Example: A Traveler scores 600 points in Violet Lightning Concerto I and 1,200 points in Storm Butterfly Intermezzo I. The Traveler attempts Violet Lightning Concerto I again, this time scoring 500 points. The Traveler's total score is still 600 + 1,200 = 1,800.)

After the event ends, all points will be cleared and no further rewards can be claimed. Don't forget to claim your rewards in good time!
