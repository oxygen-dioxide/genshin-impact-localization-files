'''''Hammer of the Mushrooms''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] in [[Sumeru]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|Several strange mushrooms have suddenly appeared out in the wild. Who knows what might happen if you knock on them...}}
# Complete the mushroom-knocking challenge
#* Interact with the [[Time Trial Challenge]] to start the challenge.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Every (approximately) 4 seconds, mushrooms will pop up in some of the holes. Of the mushrooms, 1–3 will be Floppy Mushrooms (taller than the others). Hit enough of them with any attack to complete the challenge.
** Damageless applications of elements, such as from [[Alternate Sprint]]s or [[Barbara]]'s [[Let the Show Begin♪]], count as hits.
* Hitting all the Floppy Mushrooms in the current set will cause any remaining mushrooms to immediately retract and the next set of mushrooms to pop up.
* There is no penalty or reward for hitting the non-Floppy Mushrooms.
