|description    = [[Brightwood]] round buckets used in [[Sumeru City]]'s taverns that are excellent at containing both alcohol and fresh water. It is said that someone once opened one such bucket that had lain idle in a corner for ten years, only to find that the water within did not have any odd flavor. When the cause was investigated, it was found that this bucket had used a special coating and self-tightening bucket hoop developed by the [[Akademiya]], with the original design intent being to store water effectively on ships for long voyages. Unfortunately, its high cost meant that it came to be used at scale by the more wealthy city stores instead...
