==Profile==
Flash-Fist Ling is training under the [[Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz]], oblivious to the old man's obvious scam. When spoken to, he "demonstrates" a technique of The Way (the "martial art" he is studying) called the Dance of the Frenzied Turtle, which allegedly has his fists moving so fast that you can't see them move. This is naturally a lie, but Flash-Fist Ling is so deep into his sunken cost fallacy that he continues to believe that he is truly learning a martial art. During the {{Quest|Where the Light Wanes}}, Ling tries to fight a group of [[Hilichurl]]s but has to be rescued by the [[Traveler]]. Despite this failure, after the event he returns to his master, still convinced that he is training in a true martial art.

===Appearance===
Flash-Fist Ling is a young man with shaggy black hair and a small moustache. He wears a light gray vest over a dark gray shirt, and dark gray trousers. His shoes and belt are dark brown, and he wears guards on his forearms and shins.
