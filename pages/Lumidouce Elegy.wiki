==Description==
In the undercity that knows neither rain nor sun, she eked out a miserable existence, and for as little as a slice or two of moldy bread,<br><!--
-->She would not flinch from pulling out a rusty blade to take the life of someone as insignificant as herself.<br><!--
-->That the weak and cowardly inevitably become prey for the strong &mdash; this is the "natural order" that rules the [[Fleuve Cendre]].<br><!--
-->As such, if some day the hunter should become the hunted, they should accept their fate as prey,<br><!--
-->Just as her late mother had taught her: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<br><br><!--
-->Looking back on her life, everything up to this point seemed utterly without meaning, with nothing achieved and nothing to hope for.<br><!--
-->Yet if this was the "natural" way of the world, then coming to accept this was surely a form of happiness in its own right?<br><!--
-->However, in spite of her expectations, death did not come. Opening one eye nervously, she looked up,<br><!--
-->To see a [[Parsifal the Great| girl in strange attire]] smiling back gently, who then placed a flower &mdash; whence it came she knew not &mdash; behind her ear.<br><br><!--
-->"We call this flower a Lumidouce Bell, which in the language of flowers... means hope. Look, the color matches your hair."<br><!--
-->"You have such beautiful eyes. It would be such a pity if all they reflected was despair."<br><!--
-->"Come, little lass with the sapphire eyes, let me trade this flower for your heart."<br><br><!--
-->Thus did [[Marfisa]], who would be later famed as a [[Champion Duelist]], first step into the city above ground.<br><!--
-->Watching on from the luxury of a VIP box in the magnificent theater, she could no longer remember the smiling faces of the magician and [[Josephine|their assistant]] on stage,<br><!--
-->Only how, as the fantasy played out, a profusion of flowers blossomed under the dazzling spotlight &mdash; bright, pure, and ever so strong.<br><!--
-->If she could walk in the sunlight as "naturally" as her, she would no longer need to hide in the ashes.<br><!--
-->Seeing this, she understood that she should yet cherish hope &mdash; that this life, having now seen the light, might blossom like Lumidouce.<br><br><!--
-->In this way, just as she dreamed, the girl born from the ashes finally stepped onto a stage of her own,<br><!--
-->And with no master passing down techniques but relying only on her own astonishing talent, all the spear-fighting techniques she had ever seen found expression in her performance.<br><!--
-->There was no mercy under the sharp edge of her lance, only showers of crimson, like a bed of scarlet roses falling for her alone.<br><!--
-->On stage, hers was a cold and noble figure that seemed to dance with "death" itself,<br><!--
-->Almost like the sapphire witch in [[Coppelius|Master Coppelius's]] famous work, who was said to be able to visualize fatal flaws.<br><br><!--
-->Life and death, victory and defeat, all was the way it should be, and so long as she acted in accordance with logic as she saw it,<br><!--
-->The path to "victory" would open up before her &mdash; irrespective of good, evil, and the so-called rules of the overworld.<br><!--
-->Until one day, finally reaching the end of her unbeaten streak, she was deceived by a [[Emanuel Guillotin|swordsman]]'s sly eyes, tricked by a deliberate slowing of the rhythm,<br><!--
-->Into revealing a fatal flaw of her own, her arm struck by his blade, forcing her to concede that her skill was inferior.<br><br><!--
-->"You have an interesting style of fighting, albeit slightly stiff, as if you follow a predetermined path."<br><!--
-->"But human hearts change, and in this world there is no such thing as a light that burns forever. Being a stickler for the rules is your weakness."<br><!--
-->"That said, your style seems to rely solely on the 'rules' you so trust in, hence your difficulty in abandoning them."<br><!--
-->"Perhaps you should consider changing your approach, and making 'that which is immutable' your 'rule' instead?"<br><!--
-->"For instance, take 'justice.' As the [[Cassiodor|Golden Hunter]] put it, even should the sky fall and the earth be rent asunder, there would still be justice in the world."<br><br><!--
-->"What right do you surface dwellers have to speak of justice? Your skills may be slightly superior to mine, yet you need not lecture me so, all high and mighty."<br><!--
-->"Sooner or later, Hunter, there will come a day when you too will fall before my lance."<br><br><!--
-->Despite her reply, perhaps the man was right &mdash; crimes should be punished and lies exposed.<br><!--
-->This is how the world should be, justice prevailing over all. Otherwise, how could he have defeated her?<br><!--
-->As it was so, it made sense for her to be guided by justice, and offer up a cold elegy to those who would seek to evade judgment.<br><!--
-->And so, the girl born from the ashes abandoned her original set of rules, becoming a purple-clad enforcer instead,<br><!--
-->Upholding justice "as it ought to be," until the fire of Poisson brought the criminal Parsifal before her...<br><br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->Looking back on her life, everything up to this point seemed utterly without meaning, with nothing achieved and nothing to hope for.<br><!--
-->Yet if this was the "natural" way of the world, then coming to accept this was surely a form of happiness in its own right?<br><!--
-->But despite this, when she fell into those pure sourcewaters, all that had previously seemed self-evident lost its meaning.<br><!--
-->Up to the moment her memories dissolved in the water, she never knew that the Lumidouce Bell's true meaning in the language of flowers was never hope,<br><!--
-->Just as her late mother had taught her: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,<br><!--
-->And at the end of that long pursuit, even fate did not offer her the blossoming elegy that it ought to have.
