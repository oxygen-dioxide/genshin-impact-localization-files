{{Lang|'''Raiden Makoto'''|ja=雷電眞|ja_rm=Raiden Makoto}},<ref name="Cleansing Light">{{Ref/Quest|Cleansing Light}}</ref> also known by her {{w|Goetic}} name '''Baal''', was the original [[Electro Archon]] and [[Shogun]] of [[Inazuma]], and predecessor to her younger twin sister, [[Ei]]. Makoto's divine ideal was also "Eternity," but rather than Ei's pursuit of solemn stillness, Makoto cherished each moment within time and space.<ref name="God of Eternity" group="Note">In ''[[Radiant Sakura]]'', Makoto confirms that her ideal is also eternity, that "Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within." Ei comments that Makoto's understanding of eternity is much more profound than her, leading to her "no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis." In {{Quest|Wishes (Quest)|showType=0}}, Yae Miko points out that Makoto "in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her."</ref>

Makoto was one of the casualties in the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. Since then, Ei has assumed the [[Shogunate]].

==Profile==
===Introduction===
Makoto and Ei were identical twin [[gods]] who lived during the time of the [[Archon War]]. While Ei was a far more formidable warrior than the peaceful Makoto, Ei believed Makoto to be a better ruler for humanity. After prevailing and slaying all their rivals, Ei willingly sacrificed her body so Makoto could ascend to [[Celestia]] and become one of [[The Seven]].<ref name="Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi"/> After becoming the first [[Electro]] Archon, Makoto recreated Ei's body and made Ei her {{Lang|''kagemusha''|ja=影武者|ja_tl=shadow warrior}}, or body double.<ref name="Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi"/> As far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. They complemented each other, and they ruled Inazuma jointly; therefore, there was no need for the public to know the truth. The name "Baal" and the title of Raiden Shogun were understood to refer to both of them.

===Appearance===
Being Ei's twin sister, Makoto was physically similar to her. She had fair skin, purple eyes, and long, dark violet hair that becomes lighter at the ends. Her hair was braided only halfway through by a pink hair string in a bow knot, with the rest flowing freely. She didn't seemed to have a beauty mark under her eye like Ei or her blue pupils (although it could be due to stylistic choices). 

Her outfit was a light lavender short kimono fastened around her waist by a crimson obi tied into a bow at her back, similar to the [[Raiden Shogun|Raiden Shogun's]] default attire, [[Narukami's Law]], and white socks with black platform sandals. As accessories, she had an ōgi-bira kanzashi ornament (now belonging to Ei), decorated by a big purple flower and light lavender wisteria flowers, and a purple {{w|Oil-paper umbrella|wagasa}} with light lavender wisteria flowers dangling on the edges.

==Story==
===History===
Alongside her sister Ei, the two prevailed during the [[Archon War]] and ruled Inazuma justly, with all those living under their domain doing so in peace. Makoto agreed to let Ei serve as her kagemusha and met with the original Seven from time to time in [[Liyue]]. When governing Inazuma, Makoto presumably handled general affairs, while Ei would handle those that would require force.<ref name="Wishes">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

The two would live in relative peace until the [[cataclysm]] 500 years prior to the start of the game, when monsters began appearing across Inazuma and leaving mass trails of destruction in their wake. Makoto headed to [[Khaenri'ah]] alone without informing Ei, as she was compelled to do so. By the time Ei found Makoto in Khaenri'ah, she had already fallen unconscious in the ensuing battle and was dying; however, Ei was able to save part of her consciousness and moved it to a torii gate underneath the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]]. Before her physical death, Makoto had also imbued part of the Musou Isshin with her consciousness that would only awaken when Ei had used its full power, and also spawned the [[Sacred Sakura]] on top of [[Mt. Yougou]]. Ei would use the Sacred Sakura to destroy the monsters terrorizing Inazuma.<ref name="Cleansing Light"/>

After defeating [[the Shogun]] in a grueling duel, Makoto's consciousness spawned from the sword due to Ei using its full power. She apologized to Ei for leaving her so suddenly, having intended to slowly convince her of her views over time but could not as she could not ignore Khaenri'ah. Before the last of her consciousness faded away, she handed Ei a seed of the Sacred Sakura and lamented that she could not see what Inazuma looked like in the present day. Ei believed that Makoto had [[Istaroth]] involved in the creation of the Sacred Sakura and that without her intervention, Inazuma would have been consumed by the darkness.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Radiant Sakura|1}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Makoto is also known by these aliases or terms of address:
** Her Excellency<ref name="Cleansing Light"/>
** Almighty Shogun<ref name="Cleansing Light"/>
* Makoto shares her English, Chinese, and Japanese voice actors with the Raiden Shogun.
===Etymology===
* {{Lang|"Makoto"|ja=真}} literally means "real" or "true", alluding to her role as the "true" Shogun; this is also reflected in her sister and body double's name, as {{Lang|"Ei"|ja=影}} literally means "shadow". 
* In the demonology grimoire ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon}}'', "{{w|Bael (demon)|Baal}}" (also spelled Bael) is the first King of Hell. Also listed in the ''{{w|Pseudomonarchia Daemonum}}'', Bael has the power to make men invisible and holds estates in the east.
** In ancient Mesopotamian religions, there was a {{w|Hadad|storm and rain god}} that was sometimes referred to as {{lang|"Baal-zephon"|he=בַּעַל צְפֹן|he_rm=Baʿal Ṣəfōn}}, often simplified to {{lang|"{{w|Baal}}"|he=בַּעַל|he_rm=Baʿal}}, a title used in the Northwest Semitic languages of antiquity to refer to an "owner" or "lord."
** The name [[Beelzebul]] is derived from the Hebrew {{lang|mini=1|he=בַּעַל זְבוּב|he_rm=Baʿal-zəḇūḇ}}, from the {{w|Book of Kings|second book of Kings}}. In the Hebrew Bible, the term ''Baʿal'' appears around 90 times in reference to various gods.
* In the Japanese version, her personal name Makoto is written as {{ja|眞}} by using ''{{w|Kyūjitai|kyuujitai}}'' (traditional character forms), rather than its new form {{ja|真}}.
