|description    = A tall tree that grows in warm, moist climates and produces a fruit with a hard outer shell and sweet meat inside. Chefs often use this fruit to make drinks.<br />The Silversand Coconut Tree's two trunks curve outwards, allowing both leafy tops to get ample sunlight and produce more fruit.<br />Recently, the [[Fatui]] have been paying a handsome sum to get their hands on the seeds of the Silversand Coconut Tree. Their motives for doing so are unclear.
