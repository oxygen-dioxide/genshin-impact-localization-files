'''The Fraught Return''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Challenger: Series V]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to stop the [[Hydro Hypostasis]] from reviving itself without destroying any of the "water droplets" by placing obstacles or repelling them.

==Notes==
* The wording is slightly misleading - the Hydro Hypostasis can revive itself, as long as the water droplets during the revival phase are never destroyed, only prevented from reaching the Hypostasis. Blocking only one droplet each round can successfully trigger the achievement.
* Geo constructs such as [[Geo Traveler]]'s [[Starfell Sword]] and [[Wake of Earth]] can be used to block the droplets; however, using the Stone Stele created by [[Zhongli]]'s [[Dominus Lapidis]] may unintentionally destroy the droplets.
