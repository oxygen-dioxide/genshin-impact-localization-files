{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the Little Tepetlisaurus)
:'''Paimon:''' He doesn't have that flaming pattern on his horn... this isn't {{Little One}}...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, where'd this little guy come from?
:{{DIcon}} The saurian egg from [[Ochkanatlan]]...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! It's the [[saurian]] egg from back then!
:'''Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Roooah?
:'''Paimon:''' So that was a [[Tepetlisaurus]] egg...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers the person protecting the egg gave it a name... So this little one would be "Aguara," right?
:'''Aguara:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, it looks like you know your own name!
:'''Aguara:''' Rrrawr?
:'''Paimon:''' Just like {{Little One}}, this little guy doesn't have a home anymore...
:'''Paimon:''' Why not come with us? Hehe, Paimon and {{Traveler}} are the bestest at making friends with Tepetlisaurs!
:'''Aguara:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe... Paimon knew you'd say yes!
:{{Black Screen|You put a red cloth on Aguara, just as you once did with your former companion.}}
:'''Paimon:''' The last wearer of that scarf grew up to become a very, very special guy!
:'''Paimon:''' Aguara! Paimon hopes you'll be just like him, and grow up h&mdash;happy and h&mdash;healthy...!
;(Obtain {{Item|Aguara|x=1}})
