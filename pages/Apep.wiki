'''Apep''' is a historical figure in [[Sumeru]].

==Profile==
[[Liloupar]] mentions Apep briefly during the [[World Quest]] ''[[The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears]]''. When [[Jeht]] explains what a [[Wenut]] is to the [[Traveler]], [[Liloupar]] comments derisively, "Ah, the children of Apep, reduced to this..."

There is also a [[point of interest]] in the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]] called [[Apep's Resort]]. Its description mentions that a friend of [[King Deshret]] "built their court in a great cavern beneath the dunes," and that this court was populated by intelligent [[Wenut]] and [[Flying Serpent|Flying Serpents]].

Taken together, this implies that Apep was the "friend" spoken of, and that they have some kind of association with serpentine creatures, though whether "children" was meant figuratively or literally is uncertain.

It is currently unknown whether Apep is still alive.
