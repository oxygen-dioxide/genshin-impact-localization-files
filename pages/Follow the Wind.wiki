:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Huh, why isn't he here yet...
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Never mind, we can start by making your entrance first, (Traveler).
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Everyone, listen up. Your attention, please!
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' We've reached the climax of [[The Crux Clash]]. This is the final match!
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' We've seen many exciting battles today, and now, at long last, the two finalists have emerged.
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 06b.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Now, I'd like to introduce our first combatant. Though few have seen (him/her), (his/her) reputation knows no bounds.
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 07b.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' (He/She) strikes fear into the heart of Osial and the mere mention of (his/her) name causes even Fatui Harbingers to turn pale in the face... Introducing Liyue's traveling hero, (Traveler)!
<!-- check to see if this line is influenced by the option the Traveler chooses when asked for their achievements-->
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 competitorb 01.ogg}} '''Clash Competitor:''' Wooooow!!!

:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' But today's final round will surly take things up a notch!
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' As for our other combatant... Uh, he still hasn't arrived.
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' C'mon, what could be taking him so long? You can't just forfeit for not showing up like in previous rounds... This is the finals!
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 12.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Apologies! Everyone just sit tight!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they got the match time mixed up?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they're too intimidated to show up for the finals?
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 beidou 13.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' We've got no other choice.... If he doesn't show up we'll just have to postpone the match.
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Wait a moment. Something doesn't seem right about this.
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Captain Beidou, perhaps we should check on the prize.
:{{A|vo wylq003 7 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' (Traveler), come with us.

;(Upon checking the vision box)
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Let me see...
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' It's gone alright... The Vision is missing.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! Did somebody steal it? Who would dare do such a thing in broad daylight?
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' We don't know when it was taken exactly.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Huh! I never thought that someone here would have the guts to cross Captain Beidou.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' No need to worry, even the craftiest sleight of hand does not escape nature's watchful gaze.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm... The culprit has acted recently. They will not have gotten far.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The Vision was the prize that I had offered, and it will be my responsibility to look after it. I will be certain to get it back.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Well, if you insist. I'll leave the matter to you then.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'll stay here and try to offer some explanation to all the spectators that came to see the match.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' If you would, please come with me, (Traveler).
:{{DIcon}} Seems there's nothing else we can do.
:{{DIcon}} My opponent was a no-show anyway.
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm, but we're on an island, where could he have possibly run to?
:{{A|vo wylq003 8 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Come with me. I can sense the winds are coming.

;(Talk to Beidou)
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'll stay behind and explain the situation here. Just get the [[Vision]] back.
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' The spectators were all geared up to see an exciting match. I can't let them return disappointed.

;(Talk to Zhuhan)
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 zhuhan 02.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' *sigh* It's my fault that the Vision is missing... I should have kept a closer eye on it.
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 zhuhan 03.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' Though Captain Beidou says that she doesn't blame me, I can't help but feel guilty inside.

;(Talk to Rongjiang or Xinxiu)
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 rongjiang 02.ogg}} '''Rongjiang:''' Word is that the prize has been stolen and that the final match has been postponed. I can't believe it!
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 xinxiu 03.ogg}} '''Xinxiu:''' Who would dare steal from The Crux Fleet?

;(Talk to Uncle Yun)
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 uncleyun 03.ogg}} '''Uncle Yun:''' The Vision was stolen? And in broad daylight, too... How could that possibly happen?

;(Talk to Little De)
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 littlede 02.ogg}} '''Little De:''' I was really looking forward to the final match... *sigh*

;(Approach the wind currents)
:{{A|vo wylq003 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? A wind current?
:{{A|vo wylq003 14 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The winds have come at an opportune moment. Let's seize this chance.
:{{A|vo wylq003 14 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Ride the winds upward. From there, we can continue our search for clues.

;(Reach the first island)
:{{A|vo wylq003 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, what made you suddenly think of checking the prize in the first place?
:{{A|vo wylq003 15 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I heard it the moment it was stolen.
:{{A|vo wylq003 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well then why didn't you stop him!?
:{{A|vo wylq003 15 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' You'll see. Shortly.

;(Tnvestigate the glowing spot)
:{{A|vo wylq003 16 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The winds are guiding us forward, the culprit is on the opposite shore now.
:{{A|vo wylq003 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can hear that, too? ...What does it sound like?
:{{A|vo wylq003 16 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo wylq003 16 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hubris.
:{{A|vo wylq003 17 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' This way, follow me.
:{{A|vo wylq003 17 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' There may be an ambush waiting for us up ahead, but I trust that you are well-prepared for such a scenario.

;(Reach the final island)
:{{A|vo wylq003 18 treasurehoarder 01.ogg}} '''Treasure Hoarder:''' Hoarders, they're here! Get them!
:{{A|vo wylq003 18 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Treasure Hoarders, just as I expected.
:{{A|vo wylq003 18 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' In which case... please stand back.
----
;(Approach the Treasure Hoarder who stole the Vision)
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 01.ogg}} '''[[Fei the Flyer]]:''' You caught up with me... How is that possible!?
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 02.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' I had even prepared a boat to ensure a quick getaway, and still, you caught up to me.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' No boat could ever match the speed of the wind.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 03.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' The wind? What are you talking about? Oh, I get it... your Vision!
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 04.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Drat, if only I had a Vision... Or if I could activate this one, then you'd never be able to catch me!
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' This has nothing to do with Visions. You may be skilled at vanishing from a crowd, but it seems you know precious little about how to conceal yourself from nature's gaze.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Additionally, your chosen escape route was flawed for reasons that are too numerous to go into, and on top of that, I could hear your boasting and proud laughter in the wind as I was pursuing you.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' In other words, you failed to meet and of the basic criteria for a grand heist: namely speed, stealth, and style.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 05.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' You... You!
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But most disappointing of all is the state of the Vision in your hand.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It appears that the Vision doesn't respond to human desire indiscriminately.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 06.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Fine, fine! I admit it!
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 07.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' I've had my eyes on this Vision for quite some time now. I decided to register after hearing that this fighting contest was full of a bunch of lousy fighters. I fought my way to the finals and...
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha, so you were supposed to be our opponent!
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 08.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' I'd intended to win the contest through skill alone all along, but then you showed up!
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 09.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' After watching the semi-finals, I knew that I didn't stand a chance. But I wasn't about to give up on the Vision so easily after coming all this way.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 10.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Since there was no use in trying to face you in the match, I decided to put my skills to good use while everyone's attention was on you and Beidou.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 11.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' I was convinced I'd prepared thoroughly for my escape... but somehow, you still managed to catch up to me.
:{{DIcon}} You've got nowhere else to run now, just give it up.
::{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 12a.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Ugh... Drat... This could &mdash; this should have gone differently...
:{{DIcon}} Hand over the Vision.
::{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 12b.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' After all I went through to get it? I think not!
<!--Two consecutive dialogue options-->

:{{DIcon}} There'll be consequences if you resist any further.
::{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 12a 1.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Hah! I know an empty threat when I hear one.
:{{DIcon}} Just do as we say and there'll be no further consequences
::{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 12b 1.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' R&mdash;Really?
:{{DIcon}} If you give up the Vision we'll let you go.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 13.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Fine... but you'd better mean it! It didn't activate once I took it anyway, it's nothing but a useless shell to me.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' You know, according to the laws of the sea, the penalty for stealing is breaking the culprit's arms.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 14.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Huh! You're not serious, are you!?
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Not to mention that the item you stole was a prize, you didn't show up for the final match, and you damaged the reputation of the captain of The Crux Fleet.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It seems that it would only be fair to brand the word "thief" on your forehead with a hot iron.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, whoa, we don't need to go that far, do we?
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 15.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Ugh, I never would have guessed you could be so cruel.
:{{A|vo wylq003 19 fei-the-flyer 16.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' If this is where talking gets me, then forget it. I'll risk a fight!
----
;(After defeating Fei the Flyer)
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 fei-the-flyer 01.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' A&mdash;Argh!
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 fei-the-flyer 02.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' No, no! Do what you want, but please, don't brand my forehead, please!!!
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm... He has persevered to the bitter end, and now death looms near... yet still, the gods do not bestow their favor upon him.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' ...Put down the Vision and leave. I've changed my mind... No further punishment for you.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 fei-the-flyer 03.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' What's wrong? Are you asking for more punishment?
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It's up to you. Such willingness is commendable and fits the way of the samurai.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 fei-the-flyer 04.ogg}} '''Fei the Flyer:''' N&mdash;No, no need for that. Thank you for releasing me. You truly are generous!
'''''The Treasure Hoarder leaves in a frenzy.'''''
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon doesn't get it. Were you just trying to scare him?
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I take no pleasure in frightening others. I was just testing all possibilities while the Vision remained in his hands.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' When people are forced into a corner, that is when their greatest strength will appear. I thought it may be an opportunity for him to awaken the Vision.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But unfortunately, nothing happened.
:{{DIcon}} So you were planning this all along?
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, I wanted to know whether it were possible for an extinguished Vision to be reawakened.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' From the moment he stole the Vision, I decided to use him for this experiment.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 10.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I have tried many other methods in the past.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 11.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Though few tales tell of a "masterless Vision reawakening"...
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 12.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' After seeing you command multiple elements, I figured that nothing is impossible.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 13.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Come, why don't you give it a try? Let's see if you can give me the answer I'm hoping for.
:{{DIcon}} I'll try.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, the Vision didn't seem to respond at all.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 14.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I see... So you are also unable to rekindle the Vision.
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 15.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' ...No matter, this was expected. I suppose this Vision is still mine to take for now.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you so attached to this Vision?
:{{DIcon}} Why are you so determined to rekindle the Vision?
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, what's the story behind this Vision, anyway?
:{{A|vo wylq003 20 kazuha 16.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The story begins with an [[Kazuha's Friend|old friend]]...
----
{{Cutscene Description|Kazuha recalls a friend he had in Inazuma who stepped forward to oppose the Vison Hunt Decree, only to be defeated and lose his Vison in duel before the throne...}}
;(A [[#Cutscene|cinematic]] begins)
::He was once a good friend of mine
::One day, he asked me about a sword art of which he had heard
::The [[Musou no Hitotachi]]
::I told him
::It can only be witnessed when "divine punishment" is administered
::It is the pinnacle of the Raiden Shogun's skill
::A symbol of ultimate power
::But he replied: "There must be one who can withstand it"
::"There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow"
::Then, the Vision Hunt Decree arrived
::People's aspirations were stripped away
::As the [[Raiden Shogun]] began to construct her ideal of "eternity"
::While I was fleeing from place to place
::I heard that my friend had challenged the [[Vision Hunt Decree|Vision Hunters]]
::To a duel before the throne
::A solemn yet brutal challenge
::The defeated face divine punishment, while the victors gain a second chance
::Perhaps he thought he of all people should make a stand
::Coming face to face with the Musou No Hitotachi
::Was all that he truly desired, after all
::When I arrived at [[Tenshukaku]]
::The duel was over
::I heard his sentence of divine punishment
::His severed blade hitting the ground
::Perhaps that was the glory he had yearned to witness
::In his last moments
::What expression was on his face?
::Before I knew it
::I had stepped forward and snatched the dying Vision
::And was running from the scene
::All I knew was that I mustn't let his hope which burned so brightly
::Become buried among the ice-cold statue of a god

;(After the cinematic)
:{{A|vo wylq003 21 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Perhaps one day I may come to find that all I have done is meaningless.
:{{A|vo wylq003 21 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But as a wandering samurai, I find meaning in traveling and the sprawling beauty of nature that lies along the way, while still retaining the "warrior way" in my heart.
:{{A|vo wylq003 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kazuha...
:{{A|vo wylq003 21 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hehe, it's just another way of saying I do as I please.
:{{A|vo wylq003 21 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Alright then. It's time we returned.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go.
::{{A|vo wylq003 21 kazuha 05a.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Allow me to gather the wind for us once more.
:{{DIcon}} If you need to talk more, I'm here to listen.
::{{A|vo wylq003 21 kazuha 05b.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' ...Do not let my feelings trouble you.
::{{A|vo wylq003 21 kazuha 05b 1.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But thank you.

;(Talk to [[Baiwen]])
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 baiwen 01.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' There you have it, the evidence speaks for itself. It's no wonder Lady [[Ningguang]] was concerned with the security of this area.
:{{A|vo dialog wylq003 baiwen 02.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' I doubt even Captain Beidou will manage to come out of all of this unscathed.

;(Talk to Zhuhan)
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Did Beidou leave already? Maybe she went back to her ship?
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 zhuhan 01.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' If you're looking for the Captain, she was summoned by Lady Ningguang.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 zhuhan 02.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' It seems that The Crux Clash got out of hand this time and has attracted her attention.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 zhuhan 03.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' Captain Beidou was muttering something about Ningguang being a stick-in-the-mud as she headed off to Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Haha, it's not unusual for those two to be at odds with one another.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 zhuhan 04.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' But still, Captain Beidou was disappointed she didn't get to witness the crowning of the new champion. She had been looking forward to it for quite some time.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The one who stole the Vision was originally to be this hero's opponent in the final round.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' He knew he stood no chance of winning the match, thus the wicked idea of stealing the prize took hold in his mind.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' In which case, The Crux Clash comes to a clear-cut conclusion.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 zhuhan 05.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' Huh? So that's what happened!?
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 zhuhan 06.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' If that's the case, then the rules stipulate that he is disqualified... and our hero here is the champion!
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thought we'd win and all, but not like this...
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 zhuhan 07.ogg}} '''Zhuhan:''' It doesn't matter, as the saying goes, "honor given is honor deserved." Now, let me go prepare the champion's medal to award you.
:{{DIcon}} So will we be able to travel to Inazuma now?
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, I believe so. Though Captain Beidou is no longer present here, I'll be sure she receives word of it. She is a woman of her word.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But the voyage to Inazuma is a treacherous one. You will be plagued by a perpetual tempest the entire trip.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' In fact, the relentless rain and wind are also an embodiment of the Raiden Shogun's will to close the nation.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on a second, you're saying she can change the weather just with the power of her mind!?
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Let us not forget that this is one of the [[The Seven|Seven Archons]]. If Liyue's [[Morax]] could form [[Guyun Stone Forest]] by casting down his stone spears, then it should come as no great surprise that the Raiden Shogun is capable of summoning an eternal tempest.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Suffice it to say that if you wish to journey to Inazuma, the [[Alcor]] will need some time. You will be notified once all the preparations have been made.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 10.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' In the meantime, I intend to embark on a journey of my own. I will travel all across the vast lands of Liyue, in the hope of finding a way to reawaken the Vision.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon believes you'll find a way for sure!
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 11.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Thank you. May both our journeys prove meaningful.
:{{A|vo wylq003 23 kazuha 12.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' One final word of warning. The part of your journey that lies after the storm may well prove to be the most arduous.
