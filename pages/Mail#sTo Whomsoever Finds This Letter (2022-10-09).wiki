|text    = I recently got my hands on a longsword — a sharp one and a true masterpiece indeed.

A prized blade such as this deserves better than a locked vault. I'd say it must be yearning for an adventure in the hands of a befitting wielder.

Alas, who am I to deny that I, too, have the same yearning?

It'd be a shame to squander my precious youth at home.

That's why I've come up with a meticulous plan to sneak out to [[Jueyun Karst]] under the cover of the night! I've got food and [[Mora]] ready, and will leave home once my father and brother retire for the night.

But I could still use the help of someone who I can trust. You get what I mean, right?

I'll bring along the sword so that you can feast your eyes on it.
