|description    = A simple but very practical tool. A movable light [[Brightwood]] arm is fixed on a heavy mount made of [[Adhigama Wood]]. By swinging the arm, fisheren can cast their nets into the river to catch fish that are swimming downstream. The design was based on theories devised by [[Vahumana]] and [[Amurta]] researchers. The mesh size is designed such that only adult fish will be caught. This prevents overfishing and its destructive effects on fishing resources.
