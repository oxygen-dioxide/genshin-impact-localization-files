==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sanguinetti:''' Greetings, dear customer. Can I help you?
:{{DIcon|Restaurant}} I'd like to see the menu.
::'''Sanguinetti:''' Here you are.
:;(Opens restaurant menu)
:{{DIcon}} Any recommendations?
::'''Sanguinetti:''' You can try some [[Fontainian Foie Gras]] alongside this red wine blend of Sassica and Ornella, produced on [[Erinnyes]].
::'''Sanguinetti:''' This wine is naturally sweet and carries a slightly sour note, while its fruity flavors stand out to balance out the fatty flavor, rounding it out and making it even more elegant.
::'''Sanguinetti:''' Finally, allow its silky finish to fill your senses with the fragrance of roasted Figs and Sweet Flowers as a parting gift.
::'''Sanguinetti:''' Those revelers who raise their champagnes in toast can never appreciate such beauty.
:{{DIcon}} You don't seem too pleased.
::'''Sanguinetti:''' ...You're quite sharp.
::'''Sanguinetti:''' Though those who come and go here at Hotel Debord are well-known in society, not every well-dressed gentleman or lady is as elegant in their tastes as their appearance might indicate.
::'''Sanguinetti:''' "What's the oldest and most expensive wine in your store? We'll have one of those." How often have I heard those words?
::'''Sanguinetti:''' Only [[Vaneigem]] can smile as he faces down such louts. My suggestion would've been "please raise your aesthetic levels before you enter these grounds."
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sanguinetti:''' See you, then.
