==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Lingyuan is a suanni that presides over [[Chenyu Vale]]. She is a friend of the [[Adepti]] [[Fujin]] and [[Herblord]]; however, unlike them, Lingyuan never became close to humanity, preferring to live as a wild beast in the mountains. When the [[Archon War]] came to Liyue, Fujin's master caused the Bishui River to flood in a final attempt to defeat [[Rex Lapis|Morax]], an act which would have destroyed Chenyu Vale. Seeing this, Fujin and Herblord defected against their god, banding together to save the people of Chenyu Vale. Lingyuan joined the fray in order to back her friends, helping to herd the people of Chenyu Vale to safety. Their efforts would save Chenyu Vale; Fujin "sank into the sea," losing much of her strength, while the Herblord left.

At some point, Lingyuan intervened when [[Little Mao]] was being attacked by beasts, saving and befriending him.

In the thousands of years since the war, Lingyuan began to miss her old friend Fujin. Knowing that she was still alive in a weakened state, Lingyuan planned to bring back Fujin's power by disrupting the spirit veins, thereby causing Chenyu Vale to "return to nature." This miasma, if left unchecked, would bring the soil, waters, and forests of Chenyu Vale back to how they were thousands of years ago, letting nature seize control over the land once more and ruining [[Qiaoying Village]]'s tea industry. During the World Quest series ''Chenyu's Blessings of Sunken Jade'', the Traveler and Fujin are able to convince Lingyuan to acquiesce, allowing Fujin to perform the Rainjade Rite and clear the miasma. However, this drains Fujin of her adeptal energy and she reverts to her original form as a giant carp, returning to her abode at [[Carp's Rest]] to recover. 

After Fujin leaves to recuperate, Lingyuan asks the Traveler their thoughts on humans going against their purpose, much like how nature does. After their response, the Traveler then asks Lingyuan about her views on humanity, though she is unable to answer. Later on, Lingyuan tries to enter Fujin's abode to check on her friend, but finds herself locked out. This is eventually revealed to be a misunderstanding, as Fujin was embarrassed to have others see her in her original form and had forgotten to unlock her abode while recovering.

===Appearance===
<!--Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 2 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each.-->
Lingyuan takes on the appearance of the [[Solitary Suanni]]; however, her fur is a darker shade of blue and her whiskers transition from yellow to orange at their tips.

;(If Lingyuan and Little Mao are at Mt. Lingmeng)
:'''Little Mao:''' Bluey, Bluey, you didn't tell me the ending to that story you were telling me last time!
:'''Lingyuan:''' Yes. I remember. However, I've changed my mind.
:'''Little Mao:''' "Changed your mind"? What's that supposed to mean?
:'''Lingyuan:''' I'll leave the ending of the story... to you.
:'''Little Mao:''' Ehhh!? C'mon, Bluey, that's cheating! You promised that you'd tell me a story if I told you one! How come I'm the one telling both stories now!?
:'''Lingyuan:''' I'm just a simple-minded beast. I cannot think of a good ending.
:'''Lingyuan:''' The ending I came up with was a bad ending. The story is also a bad story that wouldn't make anyone happy. So, I'll let you tell the ending of the story.
:'''Little Mao:''' But that's still cheating!
:'''Lingyuan:''' I do not deny that. As compensation, I can take you to see the hidden sights of Mt. Lingmeng.
:'''Lingyuan:''' ...
:'''Lingyuan:''' Don't make that face. I will give you special permission to... Sit on my back, for five minutes or so. Ten minutes will do, too.
:'''Little Mao:''' In... In that case, then it's a deal! I'll think of an ending for the story...

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If Lingyuan is west of Chizhang Wall)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Lingyuan, is that you?
:'''Lingyuan:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, sorry! Are you hunting? Did we disturb you?
:'''Lingyuan:''' I was not hunting. You did not disturb me either.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Then were you just... spacing out? Like, thinking about tasty food and stuff?
:'''Lingyuan:''' I wasn't thinking about you either. I was just thinking.
:'''Paimon:''' Thinking... Hang on, wait! What did you mean by that first part!?
:'''Lingyuan:''' I am thinking about the question {{Traveler}} asked before.
:'''Lingyuan:''' "If human activities are part of the laws of nature, how would you view humanity?"
:'''Lingyuan:''' It has been too long since I last had contact with the humans constituting the settlement &mdash; I have not been there since Fujin and the snake left.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you're making it sound like Little Mao doesn't count as a human!
:'''Lingyuan:''' Little Mao is a human that belongs to the settled humans, but is not a human who constitutes the settlement. You and {{Traveler}} "constitute" travel companions, but you do not "belong" to {{Traveler}}. That is the difference.
:{{DIcon}} You don't consider Little Mao a part of the social order?
::'''Lingyuan:''' Not in full. Most human young are like this until they are completely absorbed by the order, just as it is in nature.
:{{DIcon}} I wouldn't be too sure...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't say weird things like that!
:'''Lingyuan:''' It has been too long since I have been in contact with the humans who constitute the settlement. It could be because of hatred, fear, or maybe even both.
:{{DIcon}} Because they have encroached on the land that belongs to nature?
:{{DIcon}} Because Fujin chose to sacrifice herself for them?
:'''Lingyuan:''' I don't know.
:'''Lingyuan:''' Or perhaps no obvious differences exist that separate "us" from "them," but I cannot be sure.
:'''Lingyuan:''' The young of the humans walk with me. Similarly, a [[Man Chai|youngling of our kin]] walks with a [[Gaming|human]] out of curiosity.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? A youngling of your kind?
:'''Lingyuan:''' That child encountered a mortal in the mountains.
:'''Lingyuan:''' So, I still cannot answer your question. I must continue to observe humanity.
:'''Lingyuan:''' There are many things I do not understand. I will try to understand until I can answer your question, as I promised to.

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If Lingyuan and Fujin are southeast of Qiaoying Village)
:'''Lingyuan:''' ...
:'''Fujin:''' What's wrong, Lingyuan? You keep staring at me. Do I have food on my face or something?
:'''Lingyuan:''' I was just thinking... No. It's nothing.
:'''Lingyuan:''' Even if you and the snake both asked me to, I will never again take human form.
:'''Fujin:''' Hehe. I haven't ever asked you to before, have I?
:'''Lingyuan:''' ...Forget it. Let's go. Or did you not clamor to see the present tea garden?
