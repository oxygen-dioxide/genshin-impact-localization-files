==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Seiji:''' Sir Hanbei hasn't asked me to work on anything in particular today. Should I go for a stroll somewhere?
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Seiji:''' Hi! I came to Sumeru on business with the Inazuma Shogunate official Sir Hanbei. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
::'''Seiji:''' Hehe, speaking of which, it's a little embarrassing, but I was pretty nervous before coming here. This is my first time working abroad, and I can't let my superior down.
::'''Seiji:''' But it seems like he's still getting some work ready, so he doesn't have anything important for me to do.
::'''Seiji:''' So sometimes I'll come here to walk around and take in the sights and scenes of Sumeru.
:;(Before finishing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::{{DIcon}} What do you think?
:::'''Seiji:''' It's nothing like Inazuma! Everything here is so new and fresh!
:::'''Seiji:''' Take their god, for instance, I always hear people in Sumeru going on and on about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, I actually thought that she's the Dendro Archon.
:::'''Seiji:''' I eventually figured out that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata was the previous Dendro Archon.
:::'''Seiji:''' In Inazuma, we've believed in her Excellency for generations, so it's difficult for us to understand the changing of Archons.
:::'''Seiji:''' Also, the curry here is hardly sweet at all! It's amazing...
:;(After finishing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::{{DIcon}} How do you find it??
:::'''Seiji:''' It's nothing like Inazuma! Everything here is so new and fresh!
:::'''Seiji:''' Let's start with their god, then. I've heard that she lost her memory for ages, and has only recently started directing the Akademiya again!
:::'''Seiji:''' In Inazuma, we've believed in her Excellency for generations, so it's difficult to comprehend that a god could be left out in the cold like that.
:::'''Seiji:''' Also, the curry here is hardly sweet at all! Fascinating. Just fascinating...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Seiji:''' See you, I think I'll go over there to find someone to talk to today.
