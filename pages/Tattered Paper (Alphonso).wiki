;A Song From Somewhere
...<br />
We are children with no kin, the petty servants on whom no light shines.<br />
In our left hand is the shield that protects our home, and our right wields the sword that is the will of the polar star.<br />
For crowns we wear masks that deplore the twisted logic of the heavens, and false gods and vanquished foes lie at our feet.<br />
...<br />
Let me be the evil amidst good, the poison amidst the herbs, the wolf in sheep's clothing, the mercury in a golden chalice,<br />
I shall leave my siblings beyond blood, and fight for parents whose blood I do not share.<br />
My dear Snezheviches, my dear Snezhevnas, my brothers and sisters,<br />
If I were to one day cease my journey and slumber under the white birch, please carry on without me...
