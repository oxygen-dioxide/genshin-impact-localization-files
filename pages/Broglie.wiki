==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Broglie:''' Oh, hello! May I ask if there is anything I might help you with?
:{{DIcon}} About hydrological research...
::'''Broglie:''' To be frank, myself and my admirable colleagues have already... uh...
::'''Broglie:''' We have completed compiling the data with an efficiency that astonishes even ourselves. And our findings have already been submitted for review.
::'''Broglie:''' Our department supervisor was overjoyed to approve, and without even a glance he drew a big circle on the report to indicate he had reviewed it and passed it on up the chain...
::'''Broglie:''' After all, the approval of something like this cannot be decided by our supervisor alone.
::{{DIcon}} How long will it take, approximately?
:::'''Broglie:''' Hmm. If all goes well, about three months or so. But if, as expected, the unexpected happens, then it's hard to say.
:::'''Broglie:''' You see, a request like this requires approval from the [[Maison Gestion]]. And I would imagine you've heard tell of just how... efficient... those gentlemen are?
::{{DIcon}} So you're...
:::'''Broglie:''' As you can see, I am conscientiously fulfilling my professional obligations.
:::'''Broglie:''' You see, my supervisor has approved my transfer request. So, in principle, at least...
:::'''Broglie:''' I am no longer a researcher at the Department of Hydrology and Aquatic Life Conservation. And naturally that means I no longer need to go to the office.
:::'''Broglie:''' Also, as the Maison Gestion has not yet granted its approval, I am not yet officially an employee of the Hydrology Monitoring Station... The entire department has been dissolved.
:::'''Broglie:''' And therefore, due to the restrictions thus imposed by outside conditions, all I can do now is arrange some work for myself. *sigh* There's nothing I can do about it...
:{{DIcon}} I hope it all goes smoothly...
::'''Broglie:''' And I wish you a safe journey.
