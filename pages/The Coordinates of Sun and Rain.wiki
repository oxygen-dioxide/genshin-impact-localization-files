|description  = According to the legends, the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|goddess who had command over plants]] would summon forth a spirit of timely rains, whose name was [[Varuna]], or "water and sky." These same legends say that the now-deceased forest king used hedges and streams, and the children of the pomegranate used dreams and illusions to create a labyrinth as deep and intricate as the very roots of trees themselves, to defend the secret of sun and rain.

{{Description|Both truth-seekers and crooks will still delve into the ancient ruins of Apam Woods to search for the flow of sun and rain. Regardless, they all become lost in the forest of dreams, its green maze as intricate as a spider's web.}}
