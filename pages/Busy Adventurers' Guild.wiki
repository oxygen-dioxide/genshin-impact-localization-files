;(Talk to Katheryne)
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Sorry to bother you again.
:{{DIcon}} No problem, I've been well looked after.
::{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 02a.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' I am delighted to hear that. In which case, let me try to make this quick...
:{{DIcon}} There's a new reward up for grabs?
::{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 02b.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Hahaha... Bingo! And I presume you are interested.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' We are most grateful for your commission completion to date. The guild's reputation has grown stronger as a result.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' However, another consequence is that we are receiving an unprecedented number of requests &mdash; more than our current numbers can handle.
:{{A|vo tips explore paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You want us to do some recruitment for you?
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Ahh... No. Although I appreciate the offer &mdash; it would be fantastic to have some new members...
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 06.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' But scrambling to officially recruit new members at this stage would not really solve our immediate problems.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 07.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' So what I want to ask is &mdash; Would your friends have the time to help out?
:{{DIcon}} I'll need to check with them.
::{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 08a.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Great, please do. Thank you!
:{{DIcon}} You want me to convince all my friends to join the Guild?
::{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 08b 1.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' No no, that is not what I meant. I know that your friends come from all walks of life, and asking them to become official members may be impractical.
::{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 08b 2.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' My request is of the more presumptuous kind... The Guild needs a favor.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 09.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Right now, we urgently need to find people for our {{Color|buzzword|expeditions}}.
:{{DIcon}} Expeditions?
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 10.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' We organize expeditions to explore areas around the city and in the wilderness. It is a way to keep ourselves informed of any emerging dangers, unusual activity in the domains, and so on.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 11.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Since expeditions are not commissioned by a third party, there are no strict deadlines for completion.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 12.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' However, we neglect them at our peril. If trouble were to foment unchecked, it could easily turn into a major disaster.
:{{A|vo tips explore paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pretty important then!
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure my friends will understand.
::{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 13a.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' All you need to do is convince them to help. I will take care of all the details.
:{{DIcon}} What about compensation?
::{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 13b.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Rest assured that the Guild does not take a cut of the spoils from expeditions. Everything goes to you and your friends.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 14.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Now, without further ado, let me show you the expeditions that are currently available.
:{{DIcon|Expedition}} Check Expeditions
:;(Opens Expeditions menu)
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 15.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' You can dispatch someone on an expedition at any time, and they will still be able to join you in your adventures should you need them.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 16.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' You can also choose the length of time for the expedition. After your friend returns, just come here and confirm the outcome.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 17.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' As your Adventure Rank increases, more dangerous expeditions will become available to you.
:{{A|vo tips explore paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, with epic power comes epic responsibility!
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 18.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' And of course, matching risk with experience is also for everyone's safety.
:{{A|vo tips explore katheryne 19.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Thanks again for your help. I hope you and your friends can help out with our expeditions as much as possible.
