|text      = Reality and absurdity clash and intertwine as gloom and radiance weave a tapestry of uncertain futures on the battlefield of Invokation. Behold! The formless threads of fate lift the rose veil, revealing truths that lie beyond the portal. Hark! The people call for me, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, to let loose the dark lightning of annihilation, even as I, the Sovereign of Immernachtreich, find my heart wavering in the face of the cruel tricks played upon me by destiny...

I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, have gazed far and scried the dooms of ten thousand worlds, yet was unwilling to personally extinguish the light burning in the eyes of such a cherished retainer as yourself, and thus did intentionally reverse cause and effect, death and life...

Blessed one, should you still bear devotion within your soul, then answer my summons upon the day of destiny and come to my audience chamber, and greet your final moments once more!
