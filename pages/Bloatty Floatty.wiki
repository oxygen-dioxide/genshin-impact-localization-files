'''Bloatty Floatties''',<ref name="Lanterns">{{Ref/Quest|Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns}}</ref> colloquially known as '''Balloon Flowers''', are strange plants that can be found growing near cliff edges. Attacking or investigating them causes the three balloons to pop off and float around in the vicinity. Upon popping the balloons, a common or exquisite chest will spawn.

They can be popped with any attack, but as they typically float in the air out of reach of melee attacks, a [[Bow]] character is typically used.

==Locations==
'''See the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=68 Teyvat Interactive Map] for locations.'''

As of 4.1, the vast majority of Bloatty Floatties are found in [[Liyue]]. Exceptions are a single one in [[Mondstadt]] near the [[Statue of The Seven]] of [[Windwail Highland]], two in the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region]], and a couple were present in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] event area.

==Trivia==
* There is a craftable [[Furnishing]] item inspired by Bloatty Floatties, called {{LL|"A Bloatty Floatty's Dream of the Sky"|.}}
* The presence of [[Azurite]] [[Plaustrite]] within the ground an ordinary plant grows on sometimes produces Bloatty Floatties.<ref name="Lanterns"/>
