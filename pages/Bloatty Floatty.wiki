'''Bloatty Floatties''',<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Child's Secret}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns}}</ref> colloquially known as '''Balloon Flowers''', are strange plants that can be found growing near the cliff edges. Attacking or investigating them causes the three balloons to pop off and float around in the vicinity. Upon popping the balloons, a common or exquisite chest will spawn.

They can be popped with any attack, but as they typically float in the air out of reach of melee attacks, a [[Bow]] character is typically used.

==Locations==
'''See the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=68 Teyvat Interactive Map] for locations.'''
