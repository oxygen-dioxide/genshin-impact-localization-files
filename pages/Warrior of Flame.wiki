==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
The long part of Thoma's hair is tied in a ponytail by a red cord with tassels fading to tan at the ends.

Thoma's outfit is a fusion of Western-style attire with parts of samurai armor. He wears a decorative, red and black cropped jacket over a black shirt, along with a pair of silver dog tags hanging around his neck. The buttoned cuffs of his gold-trimmed ''kote''-like sleeves are patterned with a ''{{w|fleur-de-lis}}'' design. He wears a black metal headband on his head, with gold-accented horns resembling the ''maedate'' (front crest) of a ''kabuto'' helmet. He wears his {{Pyro}} [[Vision]] on his belt, in addition to a ''kusazuri'' (tassel) adorned with flaming [[Kamisato Clan]] crests on the other hip. The same crest is marked on the poleyns of his boot-laced ''suneate'' (shin guards) with ''tabi'' shoes. He also has small, red studded earrings.
