{{Description|An old cup made of sand crystal. Its luster is somehow undimmed by age.}}
'''Moment of the Pact''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Vermillion Hereafter]].

==Description==
This place known as [[The Chasm]] has shone with a cinnabar luster since ancient days.<br />
The mountain miners and the metropolitan merchants still tell the legend of a [[Yaksha]]...<br />
People say that the lone traveler with four arms once came to the barren wastes where the star fell.<br />
Hearing that this wandering figure's evil-exorcising travels had now brought them hence, the tribes-people of the mountains came forward one after another:<br />
<br />
"Guest from afar, please accept our wine, and hear our plea."<br />
"You may consider our aged spirits bitter and hard to swallow, a far cry from the sweet brews of [[Mt. Tianheng]] that even [[Rex Lapis]] praises."<br />
"But the heavens have graced us with stores of precious stones and marvelous jade, and we carve the jagged rock for a living."<br />
"Thanks to the grace of Rex Lapis, our lives are, while not ideal, at least free of terror."<br />
"Yet things have changed, and a dark shadow is cast over the blessing we have received from the fallen star."<br />
"We do not have any precious gifts to present as a pledge, but still we beg for your succor."<br />
<br />
The guest heard the elders' plea, and silently drank every drop of that bitter wine.<br />
The guest promised nothing, and did not chastise the mortals for their insolence, but simply turned east, disregarding all attempts to make them stay.<br />
<br />
As for what came after, all now know what happened...<br />
<br />
But the simple crystal-sand wine cup that the guest shared with the tribal elders remains to this day as a testament to their pact.
