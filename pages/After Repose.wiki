{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Time to set off! Let's head to the southeast of [[Gandharva Ville]] and meet up with the others.

;(Approach the encampment in Gandharva Ville)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here! Wow, you guys are ahead of the game &mdash; you've set up the tents already!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'd say we're right about on schedule, actually. We were aiming to have them set up before you arrived.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, let's go fishing together! Whatever we catch, we can grill for dinner tonight.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You got it! Dinner's on us tonight, hehe!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I hope I can contribute too! The other [[Forest Watchers]] gave me some fishing tips a little while ago. I'm really looking forward to giving them a try!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I saw some very appetizing mushrooms in the area, so I gathered a few for us. I'll leave them here along with some fresh fruit.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, camping with a Forest Watcher is the way to go! They think of everything &mdash; and even if they don't, they can improvise!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' This is true. I don't think I've ever had a single rough day in this forest.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' So, how has everything been going for you?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Well, there's been high points and low points, but we've had some unforgettable experiences along the way.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I see... In that case, you should try a [[Valberry]]. I bought some from the market this morning.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A VAL-uable suggestion. Just don't "berry" your feelings using food.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...All I wanted was to recommend something bittersweet.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ooh, I have a sudden craving for fruit tea! I'm gonna go fetch some stuff, bye!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' (She sure made a run for it...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She made a run for it.)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Unbelievable! She made a run for it!)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmph, so Collei chose the path of tactical retreat. Could it be that she foresaw what shall soon come to pass...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...?)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' My dear friend. You know what I am about to say.
:{{DIcon}} It's [[Genius Invokation TCG|Genius Invokation]] time.
::{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 07a 1.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Heh...
::{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 05a 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Excellent! A kindred spirit. A great warrior can sense when a duel is nigh.
::{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 05a 2.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...But it looks like we'll get told off if we start playing now. Let's enjoy the nature for a while longer.
:{{DIcon}} Not now.
::{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 05b 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Drat. A flat-out rejection.
::{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 05b 2.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But this isn't over! It's only a matter of time before I challenge you again... So be ready.
::{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 06b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This guy... Somebody make it stop...
::{{DIcon}} Alright, alright...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Birds chirping away, the soothing sound of running water... This is nice. No agenda, just relax and enjoy myself.)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, we got a bite!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'll reel it in.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Firewood, spices, snacks, and drinks... Everything's ready. Once Collei gets back, we can light up the fire and start grilling.
<!-- time passes to afternoon -->
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...This is so relaxing.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It's just so nice to go camping with friends.)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' There are three tents, which one do you two wanna take?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about the one on the left?
:{{DIcon}} Whatever Paimon says.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon just thinks the ambience here is a little better.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hmm, true, but it's also the closest to the water. If there are any sleepwalking fungi around tonight, they might stumble into your tent.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm, well that's no good... Take my weapon. You can use it to bar the entrance.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Anyone would think you were sealing the gates to [[King Deshret]]'s [[The Mausoleum of King Deshret|Mausoleum]].
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Excellent. Then this tent will be an impenetrable fortress.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'm back! How's your appetites? Ready for the barbecue?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Always!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it smells so good... Paimon's drooling...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Someone sure is desperate to eat. Hmm, I think it's time to add the seasoning. How do you like your skewers? Well-done? Medium? Rare?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait, what? Isn't that just for steaks?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hey, if it works for steak, maybe it works for other things too.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Medium-well for me!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Okay, these are about ready now, then... It'll be a few more minutes for anyone who wants theirs well-done.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm gonna dig in!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone wolfs down the delicious food...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was so delicious! If Paimon's stomach had space, she'd eat three more skewers!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I ate a lot, too. Here comes the food coma...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If you're tired, then go rest.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' You must be getting sleepy too, Paimon. Why don't you guys head to your tents? Cyno and I will clean up.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Tonight, I show you mercy. Our sacred duel will take place another day.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' *yawn*... Good night!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... Paimon's struggling to keep her eyes open...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Oh, don't forget this. The [[Staff of the Scarlet Sands]].

:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you were actually being serious about that!?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's a very powerful weapon. Try it.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can't even lift that thing!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Fair enough... You sure you don't want it?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, Paimon's sure! We'll be fine. And even if we do getting an uninvited guest in the night, Paimon will be here to take care of {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} Let's not forget I have my own [[Silver Sword|trusty sword]]...
:{{DIcon}} A divine artifact, slayer of countless vile monsters...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Heh, that reminds of a part in "[[Genius Invokation TCG/Lore#King of Invokations|King of Invokations]]." I'll tell you about it tomorrow.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 2 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But right now, it's time to rest. Sleep well, and sweet dreams.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (This camping trip has really relaxed me. I'm gonna sleep like a baby tonight.)
:{{Black Screen|In the peace and tranquility of the forest, nature's warm embrace lulls you into a restful sleep...}}
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...I think they should all be here.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon? Are you in there? Could you come outside for a sec?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Look at this.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' What the... What's this sword doing here? Is it supposed to keep out intruders?
:<gallery widths="350">
After Repose Quest Still 2.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Evidently.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Who is it...? What time do you call this?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Those voices... I recognize them.)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's going to take out the sword! Hyah...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...I'm going back to sleep.)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham? Kaveh? What are you doing here? It's the middle of the night!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Huh? Why'd they come all the way out here?)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Sorry to wake you up at this hour of the night, but we've got a situation on our hands.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Let's get dressed, and talk about it outside.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Something has come up. And since it pertains to [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|Cyrus]] and Cyno, I deemed it essential to inform you all.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Whoa, whoa, back up! Let's start from the beginning...
:{{Color|menu|Alhaitham and Kaveh tell everyone what happened earlier...}}
<!-- flashback begins -->
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Huh? Where'd the wine cups go? I could have sworn I left them here after I washed them...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Ah, there they are.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I'll have a cup, too.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Can you see if the cookies are still on the table?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' They are, and so are the fruits.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm... Ugh, this is so bland... I should have gotten a few bottles of what Cyno's group was drinking last night.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Do tell. What were they drinking?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh right, I forgot to mention. So, I ran into Cyrus yesterday evening when I went to [[Lambad's Tavern|the tavern]] to pick up some things. He was hosting a dinner for Cyno, Tighnari, Collei, and {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Anyway, they got a bottle of [[Lambad]]'s new vintage for the table. At least, I think that's what it was. It looked pretty good.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Sounds like they're all tangled up in this.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You know what it's about, right? Sixteen-year-old kid, tried to extort Cyrus? He was asking for ten million Mora.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I heard some people talking about it on the streets, yes. Didn't take them long to catch the culprit. The [[Sumeru Akademiya#Academic Progression|sages]] are probably dealing with the case by now.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *sigh* I wonder what Sir [[Naphis]] and the others will make of it.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, Cyrus showed me the extortion letter, too. It was crudely written, but the paper had this beautiful pattern on it that I've never seen before. Really caught my eye.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 15.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Gimme a sec, I'll sketch it out for you.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 16.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Okay, done. Take a look.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 17.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You see what I mean? I don't think I've ever seen writing paper like this around before. God knows where the culprit got it from.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Interesting. These are all motifs associated with the tribes of the desert.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 18.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' What? Really?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Take this, for instance. Looks like an outline of a spire, similar to the kind found on some ancient palaces. And the crisscrossing and mirroring here, I recognize that too.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It bears a striking resemblance to an ancient emblem. One that hasn't been used in a very long time.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 19.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Whose emblem is it?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's the emblem of the [[Temple of Silence]].
<!-- flashback ends -->
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 20.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' After discussing it with each other, we both agreed that something didn't feel right. So we went looking for you.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 21.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' This was a long way to come from the city... Alhaitham figured that you were probably with Tighnari, so Gandharva Ville was our first stop. But the Forest Watchers told us that you'd gone camping.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 22.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Then, just as we were heading off to the camp site, we ran into Cyno. He said he was on a supply run. We exchanged a few words, and then he ran off!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, so what's the deal with that emblem you were talking about? The Temple of Silence, you said? What is that? Should we be worried?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Is everything okay? Give me a second, let me get Collei.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' So you've never heard of the Temple of Silence? Well, to put it simply, it's an organization that has existed in [[Sumeru]] for over a thousand years.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 14.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' These days, you can find a Temple of Silence office in the [[Akademiya]]. Theoretically, it's responsible for the custody and disposal of information and documents not fit for public dissemination.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 15.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' At least, that's what they tell the outside world. In truth, it's essentially a vestigial institution nowadays. There's an office with their name on it, but it's functionally obsolete.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 16.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Historically speaking, the original Temple of Silence is said to have been established by [[Hermanubis]], one of the Seven Pillars of King Deshret and the greatest of all sages. Most of the organization's members hailed from the desert.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 17.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' By contrast, none of the Akademiya Temple's current members are from the desert region. Nor do they use any symbols connected with the desert folk.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' So the Temple of Silence at the Akademiya is just a fake? Wow...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 18.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's possible. The real question is why. My guess is, they're covering something up.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So how do you know all this? Sounds like some pretty top-secret stuff.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 23.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Did you forget? He did a stint as Acting Grand Sage. And kept the pay raise even after he resigned.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, Paimon did totally forget about that... So you took the chance to read all the top-secret documents while you were Acting Grand Sage, huh?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 19.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' If you're asking me whether I familiarized myself with the documentation in my office, I would respond that that's a perfectly normal part of any job.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 24.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' So much about this doesn't make sense. Why did the emblem of the Temple of Silence appear on a threat letter from an Akademiya student to Cyrus?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 25.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' The student's only sixteen, and doesn't have any family ties to the desert. So where could he have seen that emblem, or gotten the paper?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' You said you ran into Cyno, yes? Did you tell him what you've just told us?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 26.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Yep. He ran off as soon as he heard what we said.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Given that Cyrus is involved, he's probably halfway through solving the case by now...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Still, we should try to catch up with him. At this hour of the night, Cyno will probably go looking for Cyrus at his current residence.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 27.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm, if the Akademiya's Temple of Silence really does exist just to cover up the truth, the sudden appearance of this emblem can't be good. It's sure to stir up trouble...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 28.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' We should pay a visit to the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yes. As the sage of [[Amurta]], my master ought to know the truth about their office. You can ask him to tell you what he knows. The more information we have, the better prepared we'll be for whatever happens there.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 alhaitham 20.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' If this situation is connected to the real Temple of Silence, the emblem has to be part of a bigger conspiracy.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Collei, could I trouble you to send a message to the [[Corps of Thirty]]? Tell them to keep an eye out for Cyno and Cyrus.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, you two come with me. We'll go after Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 3 kaveh 29.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Sounds like a plan. Let's go.

:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Cyrus has been living in the city lately. He rented a place near the field so he can keep an eye on his tomato plants.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then let's go look for him there!

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Kaveh in the [[House of Daena]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' (I'm suddenly getting really sleepy... My fault for going to bed so late last night.)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 15.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' (I wonder if I can send [[Mehrak]] to fetch us some coffee? Yeah, if I write the order down, that could work...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Alhaitham in the House of Daena, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' (The Temple of Silence... No publications have mentioned this organization in quite some time. The dummy organization at the Akademiya did the job and made sure the subject never attracted any attention.)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' (Still, there's a lot of material to sift through. I should get a cup of coffee before I start.)

;(Talk to Kaveh and Alhaitham in the House of Daena, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' There's a lot of strange things about this situation. Ugh, what a mess.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Lemme think... current and former associates would be a good place to start... Argh, but how would I know who Cyrus is acquainted with? Cyno didn't mention any names, either.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...We just have to work with what we've got, I suppose.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Huh? What's that you're reading?
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' An index of the Akademiya's book collection. I recall there being some books that reference the Temple of Silence, but they're few and far between.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...How long's that gonna take you? It's like looking for a needle in a haystack!
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I'll manage.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Alright, fine! I'll help you look through them. We'll be here all night otherwise.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's a shame there's no coffee around here.

:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Actually... Alhaitham, have you ever met anyone from the Temple of Silence? The phonies from the Akademiya branch, I mean.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' A few times. Their workload is even lighter than mine, so they often leave the office to chat with whoever's nearby.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' How do you know all this? Do you join in with these chats?
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Is that a serious question? I just go about my business and pretend not to have heard anything they said.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Wait, but how does that work? Can you teach me? I feel like that'd be a really useful skill...
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hey! Stop ignoring me!
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' See? That's all there is to it.

:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' We've got an emergency! Mahamatra Cyno and former Sage Cyrus have gone missing... They could be in danger!
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Are you able to spare some people to keep the city secure? And also keep an eye out in case they show up?

{{Quest Description|update|It's been some time since your last meeting. You and Paimon were invited to go camping with Cyno, Tighnari, and Collei. In the evening, you happily drifted into dreamland, not knowing you would suddenly be awoken...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Cyrus' house)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Here we are. This is the place.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We might be too late. Looks like nobody's home...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cyno moves fast. If he was here, he's probably long gone by now...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 01.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' I know that voice... Is that Tighnari I hear?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Ah, Professor Zaha Hadi!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 02.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Wow, so it really is you. My goodness, whatever is going on tonight?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' We're looking for Cyno... So he's already been here?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 03.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Yes, not long ago, in fact. He knocked on my door, and asked if I'd seen Cyrus today at all.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 04.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' I told him that the old fool left early this morning, and I hadn't heard him come back. So we went to his place, and would you believe it &mdash; he's gone! Goodness knows where to.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 05.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' It must have alarmed Cyno, because he took off in an awful hurry after that. He never did explain what this was all about... *sigh* How serious is it?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if Cyrus isn't at home... it sure doesn't sound good...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Professor, did you hear that a student recently tried to extort Cyrus?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 06.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Why, yes. When I left the house that day, I noticed he was watering his flowers in the field in complete silence. He had a piece of paper clutched in his hand, and he looked lost in thought.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 07.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' I could tell something was troubling him, but he wouldn't tell me what it was. If Cyno hadn't happened to visit him that day, he'd probably still be holding onto that thing.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 08.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' After seeing the letter, Cyno told him to contact the Corps of Thirty, but Cyrus was very reluctant. He claimed it would only damage his reputation. Eventually, he relented, after much persuasion from Cyno.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Cyrus didn't want to report it? Well, that's strange. When we saw him, he seemed pretty okay with the idea of the kid getting his just desserts...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 09.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' As a former sage, it's possible Cyrus still has enemies at the Akademiya. That's why Cyno was so insistent that he report the matter to the authorities. I was there while they were going back and forth over it.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' (So, Cyrus initially hoped to stop this from going public... But why?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (He only reported it because Cyno forced him to. Which means... Cyrus must know something about the Temple of Silence.)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 10.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Oh dear... What on earth has that old fool gotten himself wrapped up in? I do hope he's not in danger...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 zahahadi 11.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Oh, I almost forgot &mdash; Cyno left me this letter to pass onto you. He wrote it when he came by earlier. He realized you might come looking for him.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Thank you.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What does it say? Let Paimon take a look...
;(Open Cyno's Letter)
::'''Cyno's Letter'''
::"My friends, this is a rather complicated state of affair. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose more than that. I ask you to understand and accept that I had to act alone at this stage. Don't come after me."
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "My friends, this is a rather complicated state of affair. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose more than that. I ask you to understand and accept that I had to act alone at this stage. Don't come after me."
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yep, that sounds like Cyno... Thank you, Professor. Please do not worry &mdash; we will do all we can to protect both Cyno and Cyrus.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 4 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, let's head to the Akademiya and regroup.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Zaha Hadi, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 zahahadi 05.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' (Oh Cyrus, you've given me a real fright this time...)

;(Talk to Zaha Hadi again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 zahahadi 01.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' I can't believe this is happening to Cyrus, of all people... How does a man of his age end up at the center of all this fuss?
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 zahahadi 02.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' He always seemed so carefree. Cyno and his friends visit him on a regular basis, and there's never any drama. I honestly thought he lived a worry-free life.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 zahahadi 03.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' *sigh* We've had our quarrels, but it's always over the silliest little things. Now he's in real trouble, I just wish there was some way I could help.
:{{A|vo dialog cnlq102 zahahadi 04.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' And... Oh, what about our tomato-growing contest? He has to see it through! His plants are doing so well... but they need their gardener to come back safe and sound.
----
;(Approach Alhaitham and Kaveh in the Akademiya)
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You're here? I thought you were going after... Ah, I guess you lost their trail.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' We went to Cyrus's house. No one was there. Cyno got there before us, but he was long gone by the time we arrived.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' He didn't say where he was going?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No. He left us a letter, and told us to not go after him.
:{{Black Screen|Tighnari shares what you learned from Zaha Hadi.}}
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Can't say I'm surprised.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *sigh* Typical Cyno...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Anyway, some updates on progress on our end &mdash; I drew the emblem from memory again, but in more detail this time.
;(Look at the drawing of the emblem)
::[[File:After Repose Drawing.png|150px]]
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I checked some ancient texts for a similar design. The one I found was a little blurry, but the similarities in the general form and certain details were clear enough to confirm a match.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Yeah, and we're lucky we found anything at all. Turns out the emblem was all but lost to history. We scoured the entire Akademiya collection, and that book was the only one with a record of the motif.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Meanwhile, [[Aarav]] managed to get [[Urraca]] to disclose his source.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The one who told him about Cyrus's embezzled funds was a [[Sethos|young man from the desert]]. According to Urraca, he had a striking presence and was well educated.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Apparently, the two met in the tavern over a game of cards. The guy claimed to be in the city for business, as part of a merchant caravan.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Urraca was intrigued when he heard what his new acquaintance had to say, and brought up the idea of extorting Cyrus for Mora. The guy encouraged him to go ahead with it, then handed him some pen and paper to write the letter.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I see... So it could be that this person planted the paper intentionally.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So how do we find this guy? Did Urraca say where he is?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' He doesn't know. He claims not to have seen him since that day in the tavern. The man gave him some tips on how to carry out the extortion, but from then on Urraca was acting alone.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Naphis and Aarav have gone to meet the Corps of Thirty and review the city's entry and exit records.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Also, Naphis admitted that the Temple of Silence in the Akademiya is just a facade.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The true Temple of Silence once came to the rainforest to establish a collaboration with the Akademiya, but as time went by, the sages gradually became corrupt and foolish.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The Temple of Silence felt that they could no longer trust the Akademiya, and ended the partnership. They retreated back to the desert about four hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Ever since its inception, the Temple of Silence has been the guardians of King Deshret's civilization and belief system. They traveled throughout Sumeru, sequestering and guarding any wisdom that posed a threat to the people's livelihoods.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' At its roots, it was a legitimate and reputable organization whose purpose was to guide people towards the right path.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...The Akademiya of the day knew that the split would damage their reputation if it became a matter of public knowledge. And so, they set up a dummy organization of their own to conceal the truth.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not only that, but they managed to keep up the charade for hundreds of years...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' So how did Cyrus become acquainted with the true Temple of Silence if they left centuries ago?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'll bet that's the question that bothered Cyno. Probably why he went after him in such a rush.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Whoever is behind this, getting Urraca to extort Cyrus was only the first step of the plan. Their true goal in doing so was for Cyrus to see the emblem on the letter.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' He must have recognized it right away. That'll be why he didn't want to involve the authorities. He probably hoped to take care of the whole thing by himself... Unfortunately for him, Cyno had other plans.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Since the desert is where the Temple of Silence originated, that is in all likelihood where Cyrus went.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...I have to go after him.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Really? Are you sure that's a good idea, with how you respond to the heat? Why don't we send someone else?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I should be fine as long as I bring plenty of water. Besides, I just can't shake this ominous feeling that if we don't catch up to them soon... *sigh*
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 01.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Everyone, I have news from the Corps of Thirty.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Master.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's Naphis, Tighnari's Master? Whoa, we're finally getting to meet him in person.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 02.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' It's a pleasure to meet you, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 03.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Several independent eyewitnesses have reported seeing Cyrus and Mahamatra Cyno leaving the city at different times. Both were heading in the direction of [[Caravan Ribat]].
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 04.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' I was going to suggest that you join forces with the Corps of Thirty in this case, however... as I'm sure you've already heard from Alhaitham and Kaveh, the Temple of Silence is involved.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 05.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' The Akademiya has made a number of decisions throughout history that I am ashamed to talk about. It may well be that no better choice was available to them, but those actions are nonetheless a stain on our legacy.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 06.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' I won't attempt to make you understand the Akademiya's perspective. Now is the time for action.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I understand where you're coming from, Master, but I'm afraid the situation might be more complicated than we thought. I think... we need to keep a low profile, or risk making things worse.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 07.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' ...Good point. If Cyrus is involved with the other side... Or worse, if he's fallen into their hands, and...
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 08.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' *sigh* Everyone, we have to get Cyrus and Cyno back safely. We cannot afford to lose them.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Need our help? Whatever you need, we got you covered!
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 09.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Really? Wonderful, you have my most sincere gratitude.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 10.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Aarav and I will continue to follow up on the lead from Urraca. Kaveh, Scribe Alhaitham, I'd like to ask you to cover the duties of the House of Daena.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 11.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Tighnari. You're planning to go into the desert, correct?
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I am. Kaveh, I'll be okay. You stay behind to help Master and Alhaitham.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Well, if you're sure... Okay. But be careful.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 nafis 12.ogg}} '''Naphis:''' Thank you all. Aarav, let's go.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You'd better get moving. Don't forget to ask for help when you need it.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Will do! Let's go, Tighnari. Hopefully we can catch up with Cyno before it's too late.
:{{A|vo cnlq102 5 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Knowing him, he's probably covered a fair distance already. But we still have a shot. Let's take it.
