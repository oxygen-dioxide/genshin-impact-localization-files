'''Elemental Absorption''' refers to how certain [[Anemo]] skills can absorb one of the four elements [[Electro]], [[Pyro]], [[Hydro]] or [[Cryo]] on its first contact with such an element and then become infused with that element, dealing DMG of that type in addition to {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

Generally, only one element can be absorbed per use. If multiple elements are present, there is a priority for which element is absorbed.

Additional elemental damage dealt by skills that have absorbed an element should not be confused with [[Swirl]] damage. Swirl damage is fixed damage based only on character level and elemental mastery, while additional elemental damage from elemental absorption is regular damage and is thus affected by the stats that normally affect [[damage]], including [[attack]], [[Critical Hit|critical hit]] rate and damage, and elemental [[Damage Bonus|damage bonus]]es.

==Elemental Sources==
All characters, enemies, or objects affected by an [[Gauge Unit Theory/Auras|elemental status]] can serve as sources of Elemental Absorption. This also includes [[Gauge Unit Theory/Auras#Self Auras|self-applied elemental statuses]]. In [[Co-Op Mode]], elements that teammates are affected with can also be absorbed. Most character elemental abilities do not serve as sources of Elemental Absorption, with the only exception being [[Guoba Attack]] where Guoba himself is infused with Pyro when he spits fire.

The absorbed element can be used to further trigger elemental reactions, including [[Swirl]]. The number of times absorbed elements are applied will depend on the respective talent's [[Internal Cooldown]].
*For example, one can use Venti's burst Wind's Grand Ode to absorb Pyro and then apply Hydro attacks to proc [[Vaporize]] reactions.

==Absorption Priority==
In cases where more than one element can be absorbed there seems to be a priority.<ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24400590&rand=855 Gauge Unit Theory, Section 4.4.5 风元素转化优先级]</ref>

For the [[Anemo Traveler]], the priority is:
*{{Cryo}} / {{Color|Cryo|Frozen}} > {{Pyro}} > {{Hydro}} > {{Electro}}

For other Anemo characters, the priority is:
*{{Pyro}} > {{Hydro}} > {{Electro}} > {{Cryo}} / {{Color|Cryo|Frozen}}
