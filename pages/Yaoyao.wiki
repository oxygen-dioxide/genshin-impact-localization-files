==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
''(To be added.)''

===Personality===
Whenever [[The Crux]] stocks up at [[Liyue Harbor]], she often goes on board to play with them until they set sail. However, this has also caused problems as someone in the Ministry of Civil Affairs tasked [[Ganyu]] with trying to ensure she doesn't sneak onto their ship. She also has taken a liking to seafood, neglecting fruits and vegetables in her diet.

===Appearance===
Yaoyao is a cute girl, as [[Qiqi]] positively compares her to a little finch and the crew of [[The Crux]] have trouble sending her off when she gives them puppy eyes.
