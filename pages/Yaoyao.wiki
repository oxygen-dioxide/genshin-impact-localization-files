'''Yaoyao'''{{Lang|zh=瑶瑶|zh_rm=Yáoyao}} is a playable {{Dendro}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Hailing from a rural area not far from [[Qingce Village]], Yaoyao grew up with nature at her side. Seeing potential in Yaoyao, [[Streetward Rambler]] took her in as her disciple, and Yaoyao left the tranquil mountains to live with her master in the bright and bustling [[Liyue Harbor]].
<!--She was [[Xiangling]]'s junior disciple under the same [[Madame Ping|martial arts master]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|One for the Foodies, Two for the Show}}</ref> but has since become an assistant for [[Ganyu]].-->
