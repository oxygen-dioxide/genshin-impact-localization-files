|description    = The Burgundy Umbrellafinch is a small, round bird in Fontaine that is distantly related to the finch. The umbrella in its name comes from its unique crest which looks like the head of a mushroom.<br>They aren't very gifted fliers and often walk slowly while in the Realm Within. Due to their unique burgundy feathers that are similar to certain plants and rocks, their neighbors from other nations in the Realm Within often mistake them for novel landscape mechanisms installed by [[Tubby]]...
