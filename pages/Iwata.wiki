==Profile==
Iwata is a villager of Borou Village who tries to grow produce for [[Watatsumi Island]]'s residents. However, the island's somewhat poor soil caused most of them to wither and die; while some were still edible, it would not be enough to sustain the village. Despite the obvious failings, Iwata refused to give up in his quest to successfully grow crops and began experimenting with making his own fertilizer. During his latest batch, he unintentionally attracted [[slimes]], forcing the [[Traveler]] to intervene. [[Gorou]] then arrived and told him that his attempts at making fertilizer was causing the villagers to complain, just as two soldiers informed him they had detained [[Alrani|a suspicious person]].

The Traveler recognized the person as Alrani and with the help of [[Kaushik]], was able to convince them that she was a [[Sumeru Akademiya]] student. In return for studying the island, Gorou had Alrani help Iwata with his farming problem as she was still working for [[Sayid]]'s fertilizer business.
