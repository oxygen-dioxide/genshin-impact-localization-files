==Descriptions==
{{Description|The mountain that saw the fall of the demons.<br />Hidden among the valleys and verdure, lies a massive machine that has lost its light. The circular holes seem to serve as its eyes, as it silently observes the passage of time.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The name of the mountain may be a reference to {{Lang|{{w|Devantaka}}|sa=देवान्तक}}, an {{w|asura}} or demigod in Hindu mythology, whose name means "destroyer of gods" in Sanskrit. He appears alongside Narantaka {{Lang|sa=नरान्तक|sa_tl=destroyer of men}} in a number of Hindu legends.
