==Profile==
Badawi is a desert dweller and former [[Eremite]] who commissions Kaveh to design and build a library for [[Aaru Village]]. 

He is first seen debating Kaveh and requesting ridiculous changes to the blueprint made by Kaveh, frustrating him to the point of abandoning the project entirely to go drink in [[Lambad's Tavern]]. Badawi appears distressed when Kaveh departs, although Kaveh is past the point of wanting to assist him due to previous bad experiences with unreasonable clients and will only give him a second chance if the player has the [[Traveler]] ask him to. 

It is unknown what happens to Badawi and his plans for the Aaru Village library if the players do not persuade Kaveh to give Badawi another chance.

===A Refuge in the Sands===

After Kaveh makes amends with Badawi, the two resume their project discussion, though Badawi continues to make request changes to the project to make it less expensive, tipping Kaveh and the Traveler that he's misleading Kaveh. When Badawi leaves, the two pursue him and find him attempting to persuade [[Roya]] to hire him while dressed as an Eremite. After witnessing the interaction, Kaveh confronts him, with Badawi explaining that he is not the wealthy merchant he presented himself as, but rather a desert dweller and former Eremite who wanted Kaveh to build a library in the desert for the children of the desert to help close the educational gap between the [[Sumeru City]] and the desert.

After being duped out of a large sum of [[Mora]] by an unnamed [[Kshahrewar]] architect, he did research on [[Sumeru City]] and discovered that there were shady individuals in the business that made a living by tricking others. As a result, he disguised himself as a wealthy merchant in order to blend in with the city residents, and commissioned Kaveh because he didn't believe Sumeru's most famous architect would need to make his Mora illegally. Kaveh sympathizes with Badawi's situation because he, too, had been duped after attempting to help someone in the desert, and they put the subject of Badawi's deception behind them.

Badawi requests more cost-cutting measures because he doesn't have enough Mora to pay for the design Kaveh proposed but believes they can make it if they use less expensive materials. He tells Kaveh that he intends to use his entire life savings to fund the project in order to leave something behind that will help the children in the desert further their education, Fearing that, despite the Akademiya's recruitment of exceptional children from the desert, they will struggle to fit in and become socially isolated from others, and wanting to provide alternative learning opportunities. Kaveh sympathizes with him once more, recalling how, despite having many friends in school, he was still viewed negatively by some of his peers for having lost [[Kaveh's Father|his father]] at such a young age, and that desert children may have it even worse.

Kaveh theorizes that even if he waives commission fees, the project will still be quite costly, and turns to the Traveler for advice on what they should do, with the Traveler able to suggest changing the style or asking a merchant to sponsor the project. Choosing the former option will lead to [[A Whole New Style]], while the latter to [[Wealthy Merchant]].

====A Whole New Style====
After some discussion about project changes, Badawi explains that the site he wants the library to be built on is in [[Aaru Village]], even though it is not where he was born and raised, as it is the most logical gathering point in the desert. He asks if there is anything he can do to repay Kaveh for his efforts. Kaveh simply requests his assistance in battle because he was once an Eremite, and the group departs for Aaru Village.

After fighting off some monsters that were blocking the path to Aaru Village, Badawi reveals that an old injury is catching up with him and that he has no one to look after him due to the early death of his wife and his lack of children. He laments the way his life had been and expresses his desire for future children to have more options in life rather than becoming an Eremite as one of the few options.

When Kaveh, the Traveler, and Badawi reunite in Aaru Village after Kaveh and the Traveler have a private conversation about his life, Kaveh summons [[Mehrak]] and explains what it is to the befuddled Badawi. [[Setaria]] greets Kaveh and the Traveler, implying to him that Badawi had previously informed her about his construction plans as the person in charge of promoting education assistance programs, though she hadn't been informed of the full details of the project, such as the fact that it is a library. To Setaria's delight, Badawi confirms that the library will be free to use, and after asking Setaria questions about the conditions of Aaru Village, Kaveh draws up an inspired design and shows it to the two, explaining how the new building will work. A Hangout Memory of Kaveh showing off his design using Mehrak to Badawi, Setaria, the Traveler, and an unnamed third desert dweller appears at the end of the route.

====Wealthy Merchant====

Badawi does not appear in this route of Kaveh's Hangout, though his commission is mentioned in passing and in the Quest Description. [[Dori]] "helps" to fund Badawi's library, and while the players are not shown the design, it is implied that the library will be larger and more extravagant than the design proposed in [[A Whole New Style]].
