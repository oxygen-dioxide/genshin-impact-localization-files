==Lore==
...<br>
Naoko-sensei passed away today... This makes [[Yasumoto|me]] the final traveling doctor still left on this island ever since the [[Tatarigami]] outbreak began.<br>
It pains me to watch as the people who stayed behind on the island fall to illness one after another. There is nothing I can do about the Tatarigami's corruption but to continue the self-deception of making sweet [[Lavender Melon]] soup for people...

"Care is also a form of remedy."<br>
...Sensei always used to say that, but it's just a thing that medical professionals like ourselves say to make ourselves feel better...<br>
...
