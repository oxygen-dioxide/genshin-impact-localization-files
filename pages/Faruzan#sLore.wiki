{{Quote|A distinguished Akademiya scholar from "a century ago" and one of the founders of Ancient Mechanics as a field of study.

==Personality==
{{Quote|A researcher from "one hundred years ago." She enjoys self-identifying as everyone's senior, and has significant knowledge of ancient scripts and machines of all kinds.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Despite being a [[Haravatat]] scholar, Faruzan specializes more in the [[Kshahrewar]] studies, being highly knowledgeable in machine mechanics and language. She's highly respected in the Kshahrewar school for her contributions, but she still remains a Haravatat scholar and refuses any attempts to join Kshahrewar. Due to technically living longer than others in part due to the [[King Deshret]] ruins she had been trapped in, she self-identifies as a senior despite her youthful appearance and demands respect from them. While proud and a bit stubborn, Faruzan does secretly struggle with coming to terms with her circumstances since her old friends and family had passed on in her absence as many believed her to be dead.

Due to the circumstances involved in her entombment, many people tend to see her thesis and points being outdated. As a result of her supposedly "outdated" research, Faruzan has issues acquiring [[Mora]], which frequently baffles and irritates her. She becomes extremely delighted when offered a large amount of payment.

==Appearance==

She has messy bangs that frame the sides of her face, and her hair is cut short except for two locks of hair that mimic twin tails.<!-- where it meets her head, there is NOTHING but a bump, look at it --> Her eyes are a pale shade of blue and are partially golden, and her pupils are interestingly heterochromic and triangle-shaped; her right eye is a pale shade of Aquamarine and her left eye is a dark shade of Indigo.

{{Quote|"Much of the content found within this book originates from Madam Faruzan's theories and manuscripts. It is our hope that future generations of scholars will remember her name when she returns to the Akademiya."|Quote from the book "Introduction to Ancient Machines." This text was released almost a century ago and is still on the Kshahrewar's essential reading list today.}}
There is a legend circulating among the [[Kshahrewar]] students:

If you have failed your mechanics exams and do not dare ask for remedial lessons from your displeased tutor, you can make your way to [[Haravatat]] next door and ask Madam Faruzan for some tips.

There is no need to prepare a gift. Just remember to show sincerity and humility, and call her "Madam" respectfully. That will be sufficient to get into the living encyclopedia of mechanics' good graces.

Madam Faruzan's explanations are simple to understand yet insightful, and her in-depth knowledge really makes people wonder if she had a hand in writing the syllabus. Her guidance will help resolve the most daunting problems, though there remain two problems that all students must overcome on their own:

The first is how to hide their surprise when they see her youthful appearance.

The second is to refrain from asking her why she has been shunned in Haravatat despite having such erudition, and whether she should consider joining Kshahrewar.

If you are unfortunate enough to commit one of these faux pas, you shall bear witness to rhetoric worthy of a household name in Haravatat, especially when in the field of criticizing and reprimanding others.

              --><p>Those words were spoken sadly yet earnestly, and even Faruzan was moved: To think that Sumeru still played host to people with such a passion for the written word!</p><!--
              --><p>That voice did not seem to belong to a child who had yet to read or write, nor did it sound like a researcher of Satyavada Life.
