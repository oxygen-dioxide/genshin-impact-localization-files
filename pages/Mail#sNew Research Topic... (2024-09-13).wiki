|text      = [[Timaeus]] has been downcast for some time. Although he hasn't said much, I suspect his experiment to create an immaculate flower for his beloved has failed. This, I fear, might still be too challenging for him.

I chose not to assist, however. He must earn this success alone for it to hold any true value, and I trust he hasn't forgotten his original intent. Whether it be flower or ash, what truly matters is not losing the way due to a momentary setback on the journey.

Speaking of which, how is your journey in [[Natlan]] going? By chance, I came across a few pieces of [[Spinel Fruit]] from that land. Some ancient texts mention that these crystals are related to [[Phlogiston]]. The refining and preservation of Phlogiston within an alchemical creation is a subject that intrigues me greatly. As such, would you be interested in exploring this with me?

If needed, I can serve as your assistant this time. My knowledge should prove useful.
