|description  = Despite the name it has been given, this creature is not actually a fish, but a medium-sized amphibian. It has a rather unique appearance with a distinctive flat head that bears a striking resemblance to a fist blade, giving it the look of being constantly ready for fierce battles with its natural enemies. In fact, they are gentle in nature and not aggressive in the slightest. The real purpose of their formidable-looking "blades" is to reduce water resistance when swimming through rivers. Thanks to their special head structure, they can navigate swiftly against the flow of turbulent currents, earning them the name "Rapidfighting Fish."<br>This subspecies of Rapidfighting Fish, living as they do in liquid Phlogiston, possess exceptionally tough skins that are particularly resilient to high temperatures, earning them the moniker "the fish that can't be grilled." Of course, most fishing enthusiasts who get their hands on a Magma Rapidfighting Fish tend to treat them as precious ornamental fish, nurturing them with loving care rather than sending them to the kitchen...
