<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Yundan is an elderly lady who was born and raised in Qingce Village. She and her younger brother, [[Uncle Tian]], left the village to make a living in Liyue Harbor. The two were quite successful, but she grew weary of the cutthroat competitiveness and eventually returned to Qingce Village, while Tian became one of the [[Liyue Qixing]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yundan:''' Hi, and welcome to our village.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Yundan:''' Just an ordinary old granny. I actually went to Liyue Harbor once, lived the rat race for a while... In the end I realized I'm just a normal person who needs a normal life. So I came back here.
::'''Yundan:''' I help look after the little ones in the village. It helps me worry less knowing they are taught to be obedient and well-behaved.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your past.
::'''Yundan:''' When I was little I would go fishing with my younger brother near Liyue Harbor. We managed to make a bit of money off it, and life started getting better.
::'''Yundan:''' But I just couldn't get used to the constant chaos of city life, nor did the cunning one needs to try and do business come naturally to me... Maybe I just wasn't meant to get rich.
::'''Yundan:''' I'm much more comfortable here. I positively relish the peace and quiet.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your family.
::'''Yundan:''' My brother is just a normal fellow at heart, too, though he seems to be doing some sort of extraordinary job at the moment... Honestly, I think he enjoys being all secretive and deliberately mystifying about it.
::'''Yundan:''' I don't really understand the rest of my relatives in the city to be honest. I wonder when they'll come and visit...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yundan:''' Take care and have a safe trip.
