|text      = During the expedition, resources were limited, so the [[Varka|Grand Master]] would choose one day each month to hold a "group birthday." It was called a "birthday," but there were no presents or cake. Rather, it was more like finding an excuse to have a meal together... Sometimes we even had to forage for food on the spot.

But I really enjoyed those birthdays, because I didn't have to be the center of attention. Instead, I could share the joy of growing up as part of a group with my comrades. However, the [[Reconnaissance Company]] seems to have a completely opposite tradition. Captain [[Eula]] hopes we can all bravely showcase ourselves, which is more than a bit difficult for me...

Captain Honorary Knight, may I ask you to join my birthday party? I'd like to chat about the scenery I've recently documented and have you try my new recipes for field rations...

With you there, I might feel less nervous!
