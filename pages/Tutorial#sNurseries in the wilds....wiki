|text1    = Some of these seemingly masterless [[nurseries]] may be found within the forests of [[Sumeru]]. Follow the glowing spirits that float over these nurseries and traverse each "field" without interruption or repetition, and perhaps something good will happen.<br />In truth, it isn't good to step on fields, but your footsteps seem to be able to awaken the life of this plot of land.
