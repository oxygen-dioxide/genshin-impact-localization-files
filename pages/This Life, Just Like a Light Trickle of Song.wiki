{{Quest Description|The members of the troupe do not see eye to eye on the ending of the script, and everyone believes they should hear what the last member, Vilmant, has to say on it. So, you set off from Poisson...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 1 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Whew, this is tough going... Dulphy, are you sure you can manage in your condition?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 1 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Hmph, I could ask you the same question! Try to keep up.

;(Approach the quest marker)
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, as if this journey wasn't tough enough already without a roadblock!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Don't worry, we should all be fine with {{Traveler}} here. We don't need to take a detour.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Wait, wh&mdash;why are you all looking at me? You're not seriously expecting me to fight, are you!?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' We're just curious, that's all. I don't think anyone's ever seen Furina in a fight before...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Yeah, but... Don't you remember why? The Hydro Archon willingly gave up all of her power so it could be converted into [[Indemnitium]]. Miss Furina said so herself.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Precisely! Heh... And I'm not even the Hydro Archon anymore, so all my power is gone anyway.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As much as it pains me, unfortunately, I should just stay put. I'm more like... a damsel in distress more than anything.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounded so smug! Ugh, the second-hand embarrassment is unbearable...
:{{DIcon}} Eh, c'est la vie.
::{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 furina 05a 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' C'est la vie indeed! Alas, I am forced to watch on helplessly as a more brave and seasoned adventurer than I swoops in to save the day.
:{{DIcon}} This doesn't require god-level powers. Don't you know any self-defense?
::{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 furina 05b 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, lay off, alright! My bluff is hanging from a thread here.
::{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 furina 05b 2.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I got carried away. Please help us out, would you?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 dulphy 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Ah, too bad... I was so pumped to feast my eyes on fight-mode Furina.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Sorry to leave all the heavy lifting to you.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry &mdash; piece of cake!

;(After defeating the monsters)
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 3 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Bravo, good show! You certainly live up to your reputation.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 3 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Yeah, thank you... Anyway, the path is cleared now. Onwards and upwards!

;(Approach the tent)
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Vilmant, are you there?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 01.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' Huh? It's you guys... Wait, what's Lady Furina doing here!?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' I can explain... We've been rounding up the whole troupe. We now have everyone except you.
:{{Black Screen|Dulphy explains the whole sequence of events so far to Vilmant.}}
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 02.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' So, you think knowing the truth about the director's disappearance will help you write an ending to the script that pleases everyone?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 03.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' *sigh* I care just as much as everyone else about making The Little Oceanid a success. That's why I wanted to wait until after the show.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 04.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' If I open this can of worms now... I just don't want to make things difficult between us. We're supposed to be a unit when we're on stage.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 01.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Vilmant... Avoiding the truth will not help anyone.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 02.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Unless you mean to suggest that [[Aurelie]]'s death had something to do with you?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 05.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I don't want to talk about it.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 03.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Listen, Vilmant. I used to think that my love for Aurelie was a point of shame. I never brought it up to anyone...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 04.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' But now, I've made up my mind to put it all on the table. I'm prepared to face everything &mdash; to sacrifice everything &mdash; for the sake of the show.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 05.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' "The Little Oceanid" cannot be complete unless we do justice to Aurelie on an emotional level.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 06.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' ...*sigh* This is why people think of you as not being the smart one.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 07.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' As you all know already, the troupe was kept afloat not from ticket sales, but donations from the audience. Of course, that was nowhere near enough...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 08.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' We took on side jobs when we weren't performing, but even then, the troupe's financial situation was pretty dire...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 09.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' So anyway, one day after a show, a merchant came to me and offered us a huge sponsorship. In return, we just had to provide the audience with their drinks during performances.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 10.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' It seemed like a win-win, so I said yes to it on the spot without consulting the director. It was only when the merchant came to deliver the goods that I realized...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 11.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' The drink in question was... [[Sinthe]].
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Isn't that the drink peddled by the culprit behind the serial disappearances case?
:{{DIcon}} I remember that it induces a state of euphoria.
:{{DIcon}} But it also causes significant harm to the body.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 12.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I... I freaked out when I saw the boxes, and I told the director everything right away. She was completely shocked as well...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 13.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' But she didn't reprimand me for making the decision without consulting her. Instead, she contacted the merchant, and stated that the troupe could not agree to this collaboration.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 14.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' The merchant was furious, berated us for going back on our word, and threatened to sue us for damages. The amount was astronomical... There was no way we'd be able to pay...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 06.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' A&mdash;And then...?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 15.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I was going to sort it on my own, but the director stopped me. She said that this was an issue for the whole troupe, and it wasn't my fault.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 16.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' But things only got worse from there. The Sinthe merchant just wouldn't let up. Then, suddenly the director told us all to leave the city one day... I knew then that things must have reached boiling point...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 17.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I admit it, this whole thing was my mistake. I didn't dare to tell any of you the truth back then, and after the director disappeared, I was even more afraid to say anything.
:{{DIcon}} You brought the director to the attention of the Sinthe dealers.
:{{DIcon}} Your mistake gave them a motive to kidnap and murder her.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 18.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' Yeah. I got Aurelie killed &mdash; there, I said it. Happy now?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 dulphy 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Hey, don't say that...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 07.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' You traitor!!! You knew Aurelie was in danger! Why in god's name didn't you tell us!?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 08.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' What do you mean, you were "afraid"!? This was a life-and-death situation, we could have saved her!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 09.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' How could you be so stupid!?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Please, try not to get too worked up...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, listen to him! You need to stay calm!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 10.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Stay calm? How can I stay calm? This guy got Aurelie murdered! She was the love of my life!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 11.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' And he has the gall to try and high-road us, claiming that he kept his mouth shut for the sake of the show! How about taking some responsibility for what he's done?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 19.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' All I can say is I'm sorry. Truly. I wanted to apologize... to everyone in the troupe. But that won't bring back the director. What good is my apology now?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 20.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I'm just a coward who made an awful, terrible mistake that I can never take back. Beat me up if you want &mdash; kill me if you prefer. It's what I deserve.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 21.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' End my life! So I can meet the director and apologize to her in person!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 12.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Get out of my sight! Go, get lost! I don't ever want to see your face again!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That's enough! You've screamed and shouted at each other for long enough. Now pipe down, both of you!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Can you stop conflating the show on stage with your real-life relationships in the troupe?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You keep saying that you want to use this final performance to pay tribute to your director and celebrate her life. How can you do that if you're just using it as an excuse to vent your own emotions?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 13.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' ...You're right.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 22.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I'm sorry.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' On stage, the lead role is the focal point of the audience's attention, and you're all used to seeing the director as the heart of the troupe.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But in her own life, her greatest desire wasn't to be the center of attention... I can tell how much she loved you all, and how much she loved the troupe.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What she wanted was to build a warm home for all of her brothers and sisters. To shield you all from the storms that rage in the world outside. That's how you should remember her, and that's what you should be celebrating.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I understand why you're trying to make her the hero of the story, but... isn't she your hero already? After everything she did for you?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 lauwick 03.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Yeah.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So think hard about what that means. And then think again about what you hope to achieve by arguing with each other.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If you really hate each other, and can't reconcile your differences, then you could just call it quits now. Why bother with a final performance if the group is already fractured?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But you can't bring yourself to do that, can you? You care too much about Director Aurelie and the home she built you all to let go.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 dulphy 03.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Hehe.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What are you laughing at? I don't see what's so funny.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 dulphy 04.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Sorry, I didn't mean it that way. It's just that... for a moment there, I... It felt like our director was back with us again.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 dulphy 05.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' If she'd seen Pauleau and Vilmant at each other's throats like that, she would have scolded them exactly like you did, in that same stern voice.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? But she sounded like such a gentle person...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 dulphy 06.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Of course she was. Even her harshest lectures came from a place of kindness, and it showed. She really was a truly outstanding person.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 14.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' I... What you said, it... really puts everything into perspective.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 23.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I'm truly sorry. I really meant for this to be a genuine apology, but... I ended up making it all about me and my self-pity.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 lauwick 04.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' It's alright. Let's save all this for after the performance.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sooo... The ending. What are we gonna do about it?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Clearly, everyone needs to take a step back for now, and reflect on what really matters. When emotions are running high, things get lost in the fray.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The end of the story needs to focus back on Aurelie herself. She's the true star of the show.
:{{DIcon}} It might actually be possible to find out more about her fate.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you mean?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The Traveler is right. You once investigated that underwater Sinthe base, and recovered items belonging to the victims.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If you could find anything that Aurelie left behind... Perhaps we can get a better sense of what she went through in her final days.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 pauleau 15.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' You really think that's possible?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I trust that nobody would object to the ending of the story being based on Aurelie's true feelings?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 vilmant 24.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' No...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 lauwick 05.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Well, we'll leave this in your capable hands.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 4 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Come, let's pay a visit to the Palais Mermonia. The rest of you, head back to the rehearsal location for now, and wait for our good news.
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Quest Description|update|Faced with the conflict between the troupe members, Furina offers a solution, one that respects the will of the director.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach [[Sedene]] in the Palais Mermonia)
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 sedna 01.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' ...You want to review some recovered items connected to victims of the serial disappearances case? But... that case has been closed for quite a while now.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 sedna 02.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' Still, since you were the ones who discovered and submitted the evidence in the first place, you don't actually have to submit an application... Okay. Please hold on &mdash; I'll have someone dig them out.
:{{Black Screen|Sedene sends a staff member to retrieve the box of Aurelie's former belongings.}}
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So this is all Aurelie left behind... Just whatever she was carrying on her person, and this tattered old notebook.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it's full of script lines... and sketches, too. Looks like they show where the different props should be placed on-stage.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Let me take a look. Maybe there's something in here from after she was kidnapped...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Aha! I found something. "To whoever discovers this diary"... Let's see...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Looks like she kept a detailed record of her captor's actions. She even mentions the truth behind the "experiments" on dissolving young women.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If we'd had the chance to examine this notebook carefully back then, it would have been a conclusive piece of evidence, proving [[Vacher]]'s guilt.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Vacher took so many lives... It's still so unthinkable, how many victims he had.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I guess Aurelie must have written all of this down in the hope that her records would one day be of use to investigators.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait... it cuts off...
:{{DIcon}} Uh, is something wrong?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Her handwriting here gets patchier and more illegible by the line... She probably didn't have much strength left.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Her final words are... ... ...I'll let you read them for yourselves.
:{{Color|menu|You read Aurelie's notes...}}
::{{Black Screen|Aurelie's Notes}}
:;(Page 1)
::Someone else was taken. That makes six.
::Or perhaps the seventh? Someone tried to escape yesterday but was caught. She hasn't been seen since.
::Was that yesterday? Maybe not. I've long since lost track of time.
::Sorry. I don't know if writing this is of any use, or how much longer I can do it for.
::I can already see my fate approaching. But what terrifies me even more is...
::The thought of seeing others from the troupe here.
::Have I truly protected them?
::Sorry. I'm so sorry. I can write no more...

:;(Page 2)
::I think I have a fever and my old stomach troubles have returned. But nobody has given me any medicine.
::I suppose I am more fortunate than Crecy... the pain keeps her awake all night.
::I suppose they think that anything goes so long as the experimental subjects can be used up before they die...
::It is so damp here. I have given her my blanket.
::So cold, so cold. So cold.
::As long as one persists, all things will pass.
::There will be a reward for hard work.
::I like to tell them such things.
::But it is I who am losing my grip.

::If anyone... sees this...
::Troupe... safe...
::I... them... important...
::Please... farewell... apologize...
::Life... perform... future...
::Regret... Clio...

::(This page is an absolute mess, and the writer's pen seems to have wandered its surface at random. Only some words can be made out, and barely, at that.)

:;(Page 4)
::(From this page onward the diary stops, to be replaced with lyrics from musicals. Some are in the form of newspaper clippings, others are handwritten with many crossings-out and changes. It is apparent that the pages have been referenced often, and that this was the personal notebook of Artistic Director Aurelie.)
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She was so terrified...
:{{DIcon}} She watched a girl get dissolved right in front of her...
:{{DIcon}} And had to wait for her own death in silence...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' She may have been a mighty hero in the eyes of her troupe, but... at the end of the day, she was only human.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I can't bear to think how painful and lonely her final days must have been...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait, this part on the last page sounds strangely familiar...
::{{Black Screen|Aurelie's Notes}}
::(Flipping through the notebook, the lyrics continue. However, one page has been torn out, folded up, and placed next to the last blank page. At the bottom of the folded note are two new lines Aurelie has written, in handwriting much more legible than before. But it seems that they took her both great effort and a great deal of time to write.)
::&nbsp;
::If you become human...
::You can reveal your secret to no one. You will face suffering and loneliness.
::Is this truly what you want?
::&nbsp;
::&nbsp;
::&nbsp;
::&nbsp;
::Because I am an older sister to them.
::I love them.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' "If you become human, you can reveal your secret to no one. You will face suffering and loneliness. Is this still what you want?"
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't that the most important line in "The Little Oceanid"?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' "Because I am an older sister to them."
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhhhhh...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So she didn't regret her decision. Even as she sat in silence, waiting for death to come.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sure this is what the troupe would have hoped to hear as well.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' She had their utmost trust, admiration, and love... And she truly deserved it.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 5 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Let's go. It's time for them to learn Director Aurelie's final thoughts.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter the [[rehearsal location]])
:{{Black Screen|After reading through the notebook, some are lost for words, some weep bitterly, and some grind their teeth and howl with rage...}}
:{{Black Screen|A long time passes before the group is able to calmly come together and finally make a decision.}}
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 pauleau 01.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' She deserves a hero's farewell. If that's the only way to convey to the audience the courage and selflessness that she showed in the face of death, then it's a meaningful way to end the story.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Even in the last moments of her life, she was still leaving a trail for others to follow.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' She did her best to protect as many people as possible, even if it meant sacrificing herself...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' We know what choice our "Little Oceanid" would have made now. I don't think any more discussion is necessary.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 03.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Well, Vilmant? If we put the past aside for now, do you think you can bring yourself to go ahead with the show?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 vilmant 01.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' ...I will channel all my regret and put it into my performance, to make this a show worthy of our director.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 vilmant 02.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' I won't ask for your forgiveness, and you don't need to worry about my feelings. This final farewell show should be about director Aurelie, and her alone.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Then it seems like we've reached a consensus. I have a feeling that this will turn out to be the most mesmerizing performance of your lives.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Really? How can you be so sure when you've never even seen them perform before?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hehe, don't underestimate my experience. After watching a countless number of musicals, I've learned one important thing.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If you want to move the audience with your music, you must fully commit and immerse yourself in your role, pouring all your emotion into your performance.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And aren't human emotions &mdash; love, hate, regret, and hope &mdash; just the most mesmerizing things in this world?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I don't believe anybody could be more committed to bringing this story to life on the stage than they are now.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 04.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Thank you for the vote of confidence, Miss Furina. And thank you for supporting us through all this.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 pauleau 02.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Then let's not delay things any longer. We need to discuss the details of the ending, and get it nailed down once and for all.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 05.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Actually, before that, I'd like to make a proposal.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 06.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' During the curtain call, please allow me to use the director's name instead of my own.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Eh? But then...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 07.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' After all, this role was originally meant to be played by the director. I'm just filling in for her.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 08.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Besides, a role commemorating her life should be associated with her name.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 pauleau 03.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Well... If you're sure you're okay with that, I have no objection to it.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hehe, now we're talking like a serious acting troupe!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Alright, I'll leave you to fine-tune your musical while I go and procure a stage.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Procure a stage?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 lauwick 03.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Oh, it's okay. Our usual place doesn't need a reservation...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That place? Don't be silly! For an extraordinary show, we need an extraordinary stage... By which I of course mean, the Opera Epiclese.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 09.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Whoa, wait... what?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 vilmant 03.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' No, no, no... That's never going to work. It's far too fancy for the likes of us...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What are you afraid of? Surely you don't think that Aurelie's story is unworthy of the grandest stage in Fontaine?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 vilmant 04.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' Uh... No, that's not what I meant...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It is supposed to be your grand finale, right?
:{{DIcon}} Believe in yourselves.
:{{DIcon}} Go big or go home!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 10.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' I have no problem with it then, how about the rest of you?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 dulphy 11.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' ...I'll take your silence as a yes! Haha. Thank you for giving us this opportunity... It really is a dream come true.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, then don't disappoint me!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If you mess this up, it'll reflect poorly on me, too!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 6 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Come on. We'll need to get the go-ahead from Neuvillette &mdash; I know just where to find him.

;(Talk to Lauwick or Dulphy, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' First Miss Furina, now the Opera Epiclese... If only the director was still with us.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Hey, come on. There's no point in dwelling on that now. We have a lot of work to do.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Yeah, you're right. Now's not the time to get all melancholy.

;(Talk to Pauleau, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 pauleau 01.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' During the final scene... Maybe we should stop the music just before Clio takes the stage?

:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, look at that! Looks like I guessed right.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were just guessing!?

;(Approach Neuvillette)
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I knew you'd be here.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I am here merely for a short break. It has been a while, Miss Furina. And you too, Traveler and Paimon. What might I assist you with today?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I would like to book the Opera Epiclese for an event. You see...
:{{Black Screen|You share the story of "The Little Oceanid" with Neuvillette, along with the backstory.}}
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I understand. Hmm, the process for booking the Opera Epiclese is complex and can be somewhat cumbersome... But given that the request is coming from the three of you, I see no reason to make things unduly difficult.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The story of the "The Little Oceanid" is most fascinating. I am looking forward to seeing it performed onstage.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I will say, however, that I am surprised to see your passion for the performing arts rekindled after all that has happened.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? What do you mean? ...Do I look excited?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Yes. And this is the first time that I've seen you like this since your departure from deityhood.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' At first, I just felt bad about rejecting them, so I wanted to learn a little bit more about their situation. But one thing led to another, and... Well, here we are.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' In the past, we sat in our high chairs in the court, giving our opinions on isolated cases, all while knowing very little about the human stories behind each and every one.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Maybe it's because I've finally become an ordinary person, and gained my freedom, that I've developed a great sense of curiosity about their lives.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I am truly delighted to see you find a new lease on life.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Now that you've regained some confidence, have you had any thoughts regarding a return to the stage?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Why would you suddenly ask a question like that?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Well, if "The Little Oceanid" turns out to be a great success, it will no doubt become a classic. Many theatre companies are certain to add it to their repertoire.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The experiences and decisions of the protagonist, Clio, are all modeled after your own. Naturally, this makes you eminently suited to playing the leading role.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It would truly be a shame if you did not take this opportunity to allow audiences to enjoy your outstanding acting talents once more.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Haven't I already made myself clear? I won't act or perform in any role ever again. No exceptions.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Nor do I think it is any great shame. There is no lack of fine actors or inspirational stories, either on or off the stage.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' This experience is a case in point. I feel like I've learned a lot, and it has already been well worth the price of admission.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I must admit, though, I'm a little envious... They're quite fortunate to be able to bid farewell to their past in such a magnificent manner.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I see. I am glad to learn that you have found a role to play that you enjoy, be it on the stage or not.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I sincerely hope the show will serve as the grandest of finales. I will have my staff book the date, and mail the relevant paperwork to the troupe once the details are confirmed.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Neuvillette!
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 7 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You're very welcome.

;(Talk to Neuvillette again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Many people were once enthralled by Lady Furina's performances, myself included.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I hope that one day, she'll be able to understand that our appreciation was always sincere.

:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 sabine 01.ogg}} '''Sabine:''' I thought Clio's actress sang very well... Why did they swap her out at the end?
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 tussaud 01.ogg}} '''Tussaud:''' I dunno. Maybe that's just how it was scripted?

;(Talk to Connie or Evra, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 connie 01.ogg}} '''Connie:''' I wasn't expecting such an incredible performance from an amateur troupe. They didn't seem out of place on the big stage at all.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 evra 01.ogg}} '''Evra:''' Yeah. Their technique could use some polish, but the performance in general felt very believable. Hit all the right emotional notes. I think it'll stay with me for a while.

;(Talk to Veillas or Gignac, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 veillas 01.ogg}} '''Veillas:''' What a surprise, seeing Miss Furina on the stage... This ticket was money well spent.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 gignac 01.ogg}} '''Gignac:''' Yeah, I agree... Say what you want about her, but she's flawless when she's on stage.

:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 lauwick 01.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Ah, you're back.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 lauwick 02.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' She's doing okay. Her condition stabilized after taking some of her original medication. From experience, though, I'd say she still needs a few more days of rest.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 01.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' How did the performance go? Was it a success? Did the audience like it?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You'll be glad to know it was fantastic! Also, you're not gonna believe what happened while Furina was on the stage... You'll probably be able to read all about it in [[the Steambird]] first thing tomorrow morning.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' That's wonderful...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 03.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' I'm so sorry I failed to see it through to the end. I guess I was wrong to try and tough it out to begin with.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Don't worry about it. Like they told me after announcing my name during the curtain call &mdash; everyone's work deserves recognition.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Even though you couldn't see it through to the final scene, the audience was very impressed by your performance. It's safe to say that you made your mark on this memorial show.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 04.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Mm. Well, one way or another, we did it.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 05.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' I've had bad luck ever since I was born, so I never expect things to go smoothly in life... I'm just happy to know that we went out on a high note. That's all that matters.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 lauwick 03.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Blaming your bad luck again, are we? Maybe if you didn't push yourself past your limits so much, your illness wouldn't be flaring up all the time.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 06.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Oh, don't you start... I don't have the energy to argue with you right now.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, you two clearly care a lot about each other.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 lauwick 04.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Hmph, I don't know what you're talking about.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 07.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' You mean, we never stop arguing with each other.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So. Any plans for the next step?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' After the brilliant performance you put on, the reputation of your troupe is sure to spread through Fontaine like wildfire. You won't have to disband if you don't want to.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You could capitalize on the rave reviews and license out "The Little Oceanid" to the bigger theater troupes out there. That would do wonders for your financial situation.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 08.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' No, we should still disband.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 lauwick 05.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Yeah. It's what we all agreed to.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 vilmant 01.ogg}} '''Vilmant:''' After all that's happened, I should give you guys some space. But maybe our paths will cross again one day.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't just walk off! Ugh...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 pauleau 01.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' I still want to keep performing, so I might join another troupe.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 pauleau 02.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' After watching Miss Furina's performance, I think I'm starting to understand our director's infatuation with musicals.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 dulphy 09.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' Hehe, you should do it. It suits you. I'd originally hoped to keep performing too, but... I don't know if my health will allow me to.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 lauwick 06.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' Oh, so now you've finally got your priorities in order... *sigh* I guess I'll hold off until you've properly recovered as well.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 lauwick 07.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' What about you, Miss Furina? Any future plans?
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, frankly, I think a return to obscurity is no longer an option for me. I'm sure a slew of consultancy requests will hound me wherever I go, until I finally acquiesce.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You rather sealed my fate there, with your "special thanks" at the end of the show.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 pauleau 03.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Sorry...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It's quite alright. No need to apologize. What I meant to say is that... This whole experience has shown me that perhaps I'm not as averse to a return to the stage as I'd previously imagined.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Maybe Neuvillette was right... Maybe "Clio" is the right role for me.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I still don't wish to pretend to be someone else, but I do have a desire to express myself... So maybe the show will go on for me after all.
:{{DIcon}} There's no need to draw lines in the sand.
:{{DIcon}} Just do whatever feels right to you.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yeah. There was once a time when I was an actress in a masquerade, seeking only to hide the truth...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But from now on, I want to spend my time learning real stories about real people, and how they touch the lives of others around them.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I want to watch them blossom and wither, see them refined on the page, retold on the stage, and remembered long into the future.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sure this is what captivated Director Aurelie as well.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like you're ready to stop running from your true calling.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The more you get out into the world, the more you'll discover what a fascinating place it is.
:{{DIcon}} Next time, I'll invite you to join me.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hehe, then it's a deal.
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If a Vision is a gift from the gods...
:{{A|vo fnnlq003 11 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Then I should do my best to honor it.

;(Talk to Furina, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It's ironic to think that in my whole time as a "god," I could only ever dream of receiving this kind of power...
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And now that the gods have given me their blessing... It actually feels more like I'm finally able to take my fate in my own hands.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Is... is that how humans feel about it as well?

;(Talk to Dulphy or Lauwick, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 dulphy 02.ogg}} '''Dulphy:''' I mean, of course I have some regrets, but...
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 lauwick 03.ogg}} '''Lauwick:''' There'll be plenty of opportunities in the future for us to tell the stories that we want on stage.

;(Talk to Pauleau, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 pauleau 02.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' I'm just finishing packing up. As soon as I'm done, I've got an interview with the Steambird to get to.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 pauleau 03.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' Thanks to all your help, this show was more perfect than we ever could have hoped for.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 pauleau 04.ogg}} '''Pauleau:''' But most of all... I want to thank you for giving me the chance to finally say farewell to Aurelie.

;(Talk to Buraud, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 buraud 01.ogg}} '''Buraud:''' Now that the buzz has worn off, I feel ready to pass out.

;(Talk to Elain, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 elain 01.ogg}} '''Elain:''' Thank you so much. I feel like I've rekindled the passion I had when I first joined the troupe.
:{{A|vo dialog fnnlq003 elain 02.ogg}} '''Elain:''' It might turn out to be too little, too late for me... But still, this has been the experience of a lifetime.
