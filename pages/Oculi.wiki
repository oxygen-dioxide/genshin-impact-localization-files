'''Oculi''' are collectible orbs of elemental energy found all throughout [[Teyvat]]. They are usually hidden or in hard-to-reach places, but are worth the effort of finding, since when offered to the [[Statues of The Seven]], the player will receive great rewards. They are only obtained once and cannot be found again once offered.

'''See the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=5,6,194 Teyvat Interactive Map] for locations.'''

*Upon collecting every Oculus in a region and leveling up your Statues of The Seven to their max level, you will have one Oculus left over of each element.
*Oculi can be located through [[Oculus Resonance Stone]]s.
*The Oculi take approximately the same shape as the [[Vision]] orb for their region.
