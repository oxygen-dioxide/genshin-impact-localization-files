|text      = When Klee woke up today, the first thing she heard was a whole bunch of "Happy Birthday"s!

[[Alice|Mom]] once said that if you share your happiness around, you'll be even happier!

So Klee said Happy Birthday to Dodoco, to Master [[Jean]], to [[Lisa]], to [[Kaeya]], and to [[Albedo]] too... Klee made all her friends in Mondstadt laugh, it was so much fun!

But [[Yoimiya]], [[Collei]], and lots of Klee's other bestest friends don't live in Mondstadt... Can we go find them together? Klee wants to say "Happy Birthday" to them too! Even if they're really far away, it's okay — Klee will bring some delicious snacks!

And when you come pick me up, I'll say two "Happy Birthday's — one for you, one for Paimon!

Klee wishes everyone a Happy Birthday!
