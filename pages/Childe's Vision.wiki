'''Childe's Vision''' is a Quest Item obtained during the {{Quest|The City of Rains and Remembrance}}. [[Tartaglia]] gives it to the Traveler shortly after they meet in the [[Court of Fontaine]], as he doesn't want it to interfere during his sparring sessions with the [[Champion Duelist]]s.

This is removed from the player's inventory during {{Quest|Finale}} because the Traveler gave this to [[The Knave]] so that she could return it to [[Tartaglia]], as the events of {{Quest|Apocalypse}} placed him back in [[Snezhnaya]] and away from his Vision.
