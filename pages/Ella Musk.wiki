===Personality===
Ella is devoted to understanding the Hilichurlian language and befriend the hilichurls, most of whom are normally aggressive to outsiders. However, she has very little field experience and has to do it herself, as no one had studied the language due to their aggressive nature. While she makes the occasional mistake here and there which has caused hilichurls to become aggressive towards her, she continues to study the language and tries to understand it as best she can.

Ella Musk is a girl with brown hair and blue eyes. Her hair is styled into two symmetrical braids, decorated with a pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ella Musk:''' Ye ika gusha mosi!
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
::'''Ella Musk:''' Hmm... Speaking of which, might you happen to know how dragons interact with one another?
::'''Ella Musk:''' Ugh, my curiosity's getting the better of me again, but what does the dragon language sound like? Do dragons sing songs and write essays?
::'''Ella Musk:''' Admittedly, I have never seen a dragon other than Dvalin. If only I could find a research subject...
:{{DIcon}} Come again?
::'''Ella Musk:''' ...Hmm? Oh&mdash; Sorry, I was off in my own world.
::'''Ella Musk:''' That was Hilichurlian for "Hello there! Have you eaten?"
::{{DIcon}} Why does it sound so hostile?
:::'''Ella Musk:''' Are you questioning my academic credentials!?
:::'''Ella Musk:''' Hmph... Well, I suppose that's not unusual. Hilichurlian Linguistics is severely underdeveloped as an academic discipline, so I still have a lot of questions regarding the exact meaning of certain words...
:::'''Ella Musk:''' The biggest gap in Hilichurlian Linguistics is field work. If I had the chance to communicate face to face with a hilichurl, it would shed light on so many burning questions, it's just...
:::{{DIcon}} It's just what?
:::'''Ella Musk:''' *sigh* It's just... It's difficult to find anyone who would ever dare to approach a hilichurl, let alone try to talk to them. If someone could test out my theories on my behalf, that would be great...
::{{DIcon}} Why is this the subject of your research?
:::'''Ella Musk:''' Don't you think that hilichurls are very interesting life-forms?
:::'''Ella Musk:''' It's a pity that so few people think the same way as I do. At best, you could say that it's just Miss [[Sucrose]] who does.
:::'''Ella Musk:''' But our methodologies differ. What I'm studying is living hilichurls, while she seems more interested in their bones.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Ella Musk:''' I am Ella Musk, Professor of Hilichurlian Linguistics.
::'''Ella Musk:''' Specifically I specialize in applied grammar for vernacular Hilichurlian.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} About Hilichurlian...
:::'''Ella Musk:''' Oh, are you interested in these things as well?
:::'''Ella Musk:''' If you're really interested, then read this book first. It's very interesting.
::;(Obtain [[Hilichurl Ballad Selection#Vol. 2|Hilichurl Ballad Selection Vol. 2]])
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ella Musk:''' Nye mita da ye mosi zido!
::'''Ella Musk:''' Oh &mdash; and that means "Goodbye, have a nice trip!"

==Translation notes==
{{main|Hilichurlian}}
Ella Musk may be less knowledgeable on the subject than she claims to be and her research may be based on some incorrect assumptions. When met in the library of the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters]] she greets the Traveler with ''"Ye ika gusha mosi"'' which she claims means "Hello have you eaten" but probably means "You enemy eat vegeatables" [insult]; and when the conversation with her ends she says "Nye mita da ye mosi zido!" which she says means "Goodbye and have a nice trip!" but probably means "No meat [da?] you eat nothing", almost certainly another deep insult.

==Trivia==
* Based on the opening note of the [[Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian]], "Ella Musk" may be a title.
