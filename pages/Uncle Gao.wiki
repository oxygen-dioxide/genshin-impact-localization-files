==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Uncle Gao is infamous for his apparently-terrible bargains: He sells fish for 300 [[Mora]] (compared to [[Uncle Sun]] who sells them for 240), and offers a bizarre "package deal" of 3 fish for 1,000 Mora, which is more expensive than buying them separately.

At nighttime, he can be found at [[Third-Round Knockout]], where it turns out that he and Uncle Sun are actually in cahoots, and Gao is deliberately making bad deals so people assume Sun's fish are a bargain and buy from him. The two then split the profits.

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Uncle Gao:''' Would you like to buy some fish?
:'''Uncle Gao:''' Get one for three hundred [[Mora]], or three for a thousand.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Get your fresh fish here!
:;(Opens shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Shouldn't buying more mean a better price?
::'''Uncle Gao:''' It's my fish, I'll do as I wish!
::'''Uncle Gao:''' These fish are as fresh as they come! Buy one and it's good for you. Buy two and that's a deal. Buy three and you're practically stealing from me. More sales means more Mora, got it?
::'''Uncle Gao:''' Besides, the more fish I sell means the fewer fish I have, and fewer fish means a higher price. Don't you get the principle of "limited supply"? These are fair prices.
::'''Uncle Gao:''' I have only one thing to say to people like you: either buy something or scram!
:{{DIcon}} No, thank you. Goodbye.
::'''Uncle Gao:''' Just looking? Hah, your loss!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Uncle Gao:''' How was business today, brother?
:'''Uncle Sun:''' Here, let's just say this is a token of my appreciation, all thanks to your plan!
:'''Uncle Gao:''' Haw-haw, they won't suspect a thing. This is all going just as I planned it would.
:'''Uncle Sun:''' That's my Uncle Gao! There's no way anyone would ever remotely suspect that we're in cahoots. As soon as they compare our prices, they'll surely think that I'm the only one getting any business.
:'''Uncle Gao:''' Hahaha! Come now, [[Uncle Sun]]! Bottoms up!
:'''Uncle Sun:''' Here, let me fill that up for ya!
:'''Uncle Gao:''' Aye! Tonight will be a night that we never remember, hahaha!
:'''Uncle Sun:''' Enough talking, now drink up!
