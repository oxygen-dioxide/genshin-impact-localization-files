{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ekwensu:''' Perfect timing! I don't have any customers right now, so it's first come, first served!
:{{DIcon}} First served what, exactly?
::'''Ekwensu:''' Ohh, I thought you must have tracked me down after hearing about my "agency" services.
::'''Ekwensu:''' Well, it must have been fate that brought you here, so let me give you the spiel! Friend, how would you like to experience every blow of the action, up close and personal from the best seat in the house?
::'''Ekwensu:''' If so, then you've come to the right person! Like a migrating fish, I'll swim my way through the raging torrent of spectators to nab you the best spot in the entire Stadium!
::'''Ekwensu:''' Ahem, with the exception of the [[Pyro Archon]]'s spot, of course... But everywhere else is fair game!
::'''Ekwensu:''' Oh, and I should mention, given how precious each spot is, I can only save a space for one person at a time.
::'''Ekwensu:''' There's only one of me, after all!
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine for now.
::'''Ekwensu:''' No, really? You're genuinely passing up on such a golden opportunity?
