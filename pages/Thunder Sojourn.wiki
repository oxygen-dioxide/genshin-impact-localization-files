==Oceanlord's Oath==
{{Description|These shards and crystals that contain great Elemental energy are quite familiar to the "Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean," enough to bring back some distant memories. "If I travel with you, perhaps I'll have a chance to test myself against opponents as powerful as [[Haishan]], eh?"}}
Use 1,000 [[Thunder Pellet]]s and 1,000 [[Thunder Crystal]]s at the Oceanlord's Oath to exchange for "Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean" [[Beidou]] (Electro). Can only be exchanged once.
