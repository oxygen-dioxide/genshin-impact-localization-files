==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|After passing through The Moon-Bathed Deep, you come to a land that is foreign to you. You see no sign of any civilization at all, and so you decide to investigate further.}}

;(Go deeper into the cave)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew, it sure took a while before we saw anything resembling civilization. Let's get closer and have a look.

;(Go to the building up ahead)
:'''Paimon:''' The five symbols on this big door must be the Key Sigils.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's have a look around. From what we've experienced in the past, we'll probably need to do something else first.

;(Investigate the mechanism and activate the gate after searching for clues)
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like there's something else visible through this door. Is it a path? Or is it a trap that'll make us bump into a wall?

;(Examine the great gate and look for a way to progress)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so there really was a path here. Enkanomiya is such a mysterious place.

;(Investigate the hidden path and go to the door)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like this is where we need to use the [[Key of the Moon-Bathed Deep]].

;(Open the door)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! Paimon never thought that there'd be such a huge place underneath Watatsumi Island!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like our goal is that place in the middle.
:'''Paimon:''' Alrighty then, (Traveler). Let's head in. Steadily now...
:'''Paimon:''' Those ruins seem to be closer to us. Let's start there!
:'''Paimon:''' Buildings means people... once upon a time, anyway. And where there's people, there'll be writing!
:'''Paimon:''' And where there's writing and paper, there'll be those... hints that we can't even read.
