{{Lang|'''Takatsukasa Chika'''|ja=鷹司千歌|ja_rm=Takatsukasa Chika}} is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in {{Quest|Long-Sealed Mystery}}.

==Profile==
Takatsukasa Chika is [[Takatsukasa Isamu]]'s young daughter. She loves her deceased father dearly, and is close to [[Ryuuji]], Isamu's former assistant, who she calls Uncle (although he insists she calls him her brother as he considers himself to be like a son to Isamu). In {{Quest|Trap 'Em by Storm}}, Heizou and the Traveler find her with Ryuuji a day after they have told him the truth about Isamu's murder. Chika demonstrates an innocent attitude and no knowledge of her father's darker side.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Long-Sealed Mystery}}</ref>
