'''Takatsukasa Chika''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in [[Long-Sealed Mystery]], a quest in [[Shikanoin Heizou]]'s Hangout Event, Act I: [[Trap 'Em by Storm]].

==Profile==
Takatsukasa Chika is [[Takatsukasa Isamu]]'s young daughter. She loves her deceased father dearly, and is close to [[Ryuuji]], Isamu's former assistant, who she calls Uncle (although he insists she calls him her brother as he considers himself to be like a son to Isamu). In [[Shikanoin Heizou]]'s [[Hangout Event]], [[Trap 'Em by Storm]], Heizou and the Traveler find her with Ryuuji a day after they have told him the truth about Isamu's murder. Chika demonstrates an innocent attitude and no knowledge of her father's darker side.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Long-Sealed Mystery}}</ref>
