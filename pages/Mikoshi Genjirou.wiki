==Profile==
Genichirou and Genjirou are both descendants of the [[Mikoshi Clan]], a clan with [[oni]] heritage. Genjirou views his elder brother as a disappointment and a dullard, and as such believes that it is his duty to uphold the clan's future.

Genjirou is a direct superior of [[Hanbei]], who was in charge of overseeing [[Mikage Furnace]]. Hanbei's inability to take decisive action when issues arose at the Furnace, which were ultimately resolved by [[Xavier]] and the [[Traveler]], was noted by Genjirou and reported to his own superior. Genjirou then told [[Toranosuke]] about Hanbei's dismissal from his position under the guise of being sent to [[Sumeru]] as part of their foreign attaché.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales: The Last Act}}</ref>

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' Hello! If you're here on government business, please tell me who you are, why you are here, and give me the delivery deadline.
:'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' If you are not here for business, then I'm sorry, but I have no time for chitchat.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' I'm Mikoshi Genjirou, a government official affiliated with the Tenryou Commission.
::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' What... So you are not here to take over my shift? Then please leave me alone.
::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' An elite like me is always either hard at work or honing my skills. This is a world in which only the best survive, after all. Only the most excellent will stick around.
::{{DIcon}} What are your thoughts about your work?
:::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' I believe that everyone should take their own job seriously. This is the only way to keep the whole system functioning properly.
:::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' Like those people from the army. They still haven't been able to defeat [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya]] after such a long time. A laughable lot!
:::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' From what I heard, the Sangonomiya troops have employed [[Gorou|some "dog"]] as their commander... If that's true, then that [[Kujou Sara]] really is good for nothing!
::{{DIcon}} Is Mikoshi Genichirou your elder brother?
:::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' Tsk... That incompetent loser. He's content with just owning a small shop. He is still the same after all these years. So sluggish.
:::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' I knew that he wouldn't accomplish anything ever since he was little. And as expected, the future of the Mikoshi clan is still mine to uphold.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Mikoshi Genjirou:''' Farewell.
