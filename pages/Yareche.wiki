:{{DIcon|Idle}} What kind of tone...
::{{A|VO Yareche 01.ogg}} "Um... What kind of tone are you supposed to talk to [[Saurian]]s in?"

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yareche:''' Uh... What type of tone should I take when talking to Saurians? ... My teacher manages it quite well...
:{{DIcon}} What's happened, exactly?
::'''Yareche:''' Well, here's the thing: You know this place got trashed by the [[Abyss]], right? My teacher, [[Matzil]], was wounded in action and is recuperating at home.
::'''Yareche:''' She's entrusted these little Saurians to my care in the meantime, and... *sigh*...
::'''Yareche:''' Sorry, please don't get me wrong. I don't hate them. I just don't know how to communicate with them.
::'''Yareche:''' How can my teacher chat with them so easily when they clearly don't speak the same language...
::{{DIcon}} Try treating them like little kittens or puppies.
::'''Yareche:''' Hey, how did you know that? My teacher does the same.
::'''Yareche:''' But even if I can imitate a cat's meowing, it's not like that'll help the cat figure out what I'm trying to say...
::'''Yareche:''' Could it be that they can communicate with each other using only the tone of voice?
::'''Yareche:''' Hmm, that's just like what happened when my teacher shouted at me for failing to stabilize my altitude during a flight! I couldn't hear what she was saying, but I sure could understand what she meant...
::'''Yareche:''' Ah, sorry. There I go, talking to myself again.
::'''Yareche:''' ...Hmm. Might it also be that talking to a Saurian is no different from talking to yourself?
:{{DIcon}} Practice more. You can do it!
::'''Yareche:''' Well... okay, then!
