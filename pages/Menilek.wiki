'''Menilek''' was a historical figure from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] in [[Natlan]], and was one of the [[Heroes of Natlan|six warriors]] who joined forces with [[Tenoch]] in a war against the Abyss, alongside his [[Qucusaurus]] companion [[Holawaqa Ngoubou|Ngoubou]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> He makes his first appearance in the form of a spiritual projection in the {{Quest|Despair Engulfs the Heavens}}.

Menilek bore the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name|VK|'''Vuka'''|bearer=1}}, which has since been inherited in the present-day by [[Chasca]]. Although it is unclear if Menilek possessed a vision, he was shown to have the ability to control the {{Pyro}} element.<ref name="Sunset">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/aGtkhL8gDYE "Sunset" Animated Short]</ref>
