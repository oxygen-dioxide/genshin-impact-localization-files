==Gameplay Notes==
* During step 26, a trial [[Xilonen]] joins the party.
* Continuing from the previous quest, [[The Surging Darkness]], the player remains in a [[Special Story Mode]] for the duration of this entire quest until the end of [[No One Fights Alone]].
* As with the previous quest, the player will have a pair of mutually exclusive options to choose from while addressing matters in Natlan. The option the player chooses will directly affect a step during this quest, and once a decision is made, it cannot be reversed. The chosen option will decide the enemies faced, potential allies met and rescued.
* The numbers in the battle reports for "Abyssal Corrosion Level," "Active Monsters," and "Total Deaths" vary among players.<!--Depending on what factors? RNG? Speed or performance?-->

:{{A|vo ntaq107 5 libiac 03.ogg}} '''Libiac:''' But if you hand me a spear, I think the old muscle-memory will kick in.
:{{A|vo ntaq107 5 kunak 05.ogg}} '''Kunak:''' There are others willing to join us as well. I persuaded them to fight. We can't let the blood spilled by our warrior brethren be in vain.

:{{A|vo ntaq107 17 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I've never witnessed a full-scale Abyss invasion before. I mean, I'd heard stories about the sky being painted black, but I always thought that was an exaggeration.
:{{A|vo ntaq107 17 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Mavuika has witnessed this all before, so she knew better than anyone the terror and despair an Abyss invasion would bring.

:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' So it wasn't just the Children of Echoes. Even the Collective of Plenty was affected, and they're the furthest away.
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' But the worst-affected region was the Flower-Feather Clan's. He said it's a complete disaster over there...
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Isn't that... Chasca's tribe? She said she was gonna take Chuychu home to rest for a while...
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Kinich didn't even stop to catch his breath before leaving for the Stadium. He said he was gonna try and assemble a team to go and support them, but...
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 pacal 01.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' But how, right? Everyone's struggling just to defend themselves &mdash; there is no spare manpower. At this rate, it won't be long before even the Stadium is indefensible.
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 pacal 02.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' And with everyone congregating at the Stadium, the Abyss forces will start converging there, too... Then, there'll be a battle on a scale much larger than anything we've seen so far.
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 pacal 03.ogg}} '''Pacal:''' On the bright side, at least my old injuries aren't playing up at the moment. It means I can actually join in with the fighting.
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The crux of the issue is that the heart of the Abyss itself has joined the invasion. That's a power we just can't match.
:{{A|vo ntaq107 18 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I have every faith in the courage of our people &mdash; the Natlanese will never give in to despair. But still... the fact is, our lives are often more fragile than our spirits.
