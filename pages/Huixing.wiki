: {{DIcon|Idle}} What in the world...
:: {{A|VO Huixing 01.ogg}} "Hmm. What in the world do those symbols really mean?"
{{Dialogue end}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Huixing:''' What a headache. What do those symbols that the previous navigator drew mean? Are those areas where they encountered leviathans?
:{{DIcon}} What's with the long face?
::'''Huixing:''' I'm the crew's navigator. Determining our heading and course is my charge, as is drawing up nautical charts.
::'''Huixing:''' Our previous navigator was getting on in years, so I came to take his spot.
::'''Huixing:''' He loved employing some unique symbols to mark his nautical maps, but he never bothered to explain the meaning behind them...
::'''Huixing:''' ...But I suppose that might be a quirk endemic to navigators.
::'''Huixing:''' I mean, it's quick and easy, if troublesome for anyone else.
:{{DIcon}} What about those leviathans?
::'''Huixing:''' I've been fascinated by marine biology since I was a child. Especially those behemoths hidden deep beneath the waves...
::'''Huixing:''' To be honest, I signed up for this job precisely because I'd heard that Captain Beidou slew [[Haishan]].
::'''Huixing:''' More's the pity that I haven't had the chance to see a leviathan with my own eyes. I'd really love to see one up close some day.
::'''Huixing:''' I've also heard some sailors say that they saw something like giant antennae around the Sea of Clouds...
::'''Huixing:''' ...Is that true or not? Who knows. Perhaps they were just seeing things while dead drunk.
:{{DIcon}} How's the symbol deciphering coming along?
:;(After completing [[Setting Sail]])
::'''Huixing:''' Ah, ahoy there, Traveler! Welcome aboard the Alcor!
::'''Huixing:''' It's been quite tough, I won't lie, but it's gone well enough. We've obtained quite a lot of nautical maps from various sources, so a full deciphering will take some time.
::'''Huixing:''' I've heard that you're quite the code-breaker and puzzle-solver yourself. If I had your help, this would probably be much easier...
::'''Huixing:''' ...Well, when you're free, of course! Also, feel free to tell me if you need anything!
:{{DIcon}} Well, see you, then.
::'''Huixing:''' I swear I'll become a navigator who actually does documentation...
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===The Exquisite Night Chimes===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Huixing:''' Sea conditions are consistent and there are no other vessels in target waters... Hmmm... very suitable for kicking off "Vigilance at Sea"!
:{{DIcon|Vigilance at Sea}} Start "Vigilance at Sea."
::'''Huixing:''' Okay! Be sure to give it your all!
:{{DIcon}} About the difficulty of "Vigilance at Sea"...
::'''Huixing:''' I would like to ask you guys: how did you guys find the challenge?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thought it wasn't too hard. This kind of test is a piece of cake for Paimon and (Traveler)!
::'''Huixing:''' Well, considering how formidable you two are, this sounds about right.
::'''Huixing:''' Thanks for your feedback. Now I know a little more! I'm going to have to think a little bit more about how to adjust the difficulty curve for both challenge and pass rate...
:{{DIcon}} About the nine certificates...
::'''Huixing:''' The four major certificates and the five minor certificates? Simple.
::'''Huixing:''' The four major certificates consist of the "Fit for Sailing Certificate," the "Ship Maintenance Aptitude Certificate," the "Power Maintenance Aptitude Certificate," and the "Survivability at Sea Certificate."
::'''Huixing:''' The five minor certificates consist of the "Basic Safety Certificate," the "Lifeboat Certificate," the "Fire Safety Certificate," the "First Aid Certificate," and the "Monster-Precaution Certificate."
::'''Huixing:''' With all these certificates, a sailor is equipped to solve most of the problems of navigation.
::'''Huixing:''' Although the crew may not understand the principle of each request, they just need to remember the main points of the task and follow the instructions.
::'''Paimon:''' This doesn't sound simple at all!
::{{DIcon}} And we still haven't gotten into the details yet...
:::'''Huixing:''' No worries! With your talent, you can sail smoothly without having to bother with all the technical details!
::{{DIcon}} I should consult Beidou when I have the chance...
:::'''Huixing:''' Okay! The Captain is a bit of a straight shooter. You'll probably become experts after asking her!
:{{DIcon}} I need some time to prepare.
::'''Huixing:''' I understand! You guys are measured and careful, so you guys might need some more time. I trust you guys!
