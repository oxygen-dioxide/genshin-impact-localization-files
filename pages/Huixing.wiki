==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Huixing:''' What a headache. What do those symbols that the previous navigator drew mean? Are those areas where they encountered leviathans?
:{{DIcon}} What's with the long face?
::'''Huixing:''' I'm the crew's navigator. Determining our heading and course is my charge, as is drawing up nautical charts.
::'''Huixing:''' Our previous navigator was getting on in years, so I came to take his spot.
::'''Huixing:''' He loved employing some unique symbols to mark his nautical maps, but he never bothered to explain the meaning behind them...
::'''Huixing:''' ...But I suppose that might be a quirk endemic to navigators.
::'''Huixing:''' I mean, it's quick and easy, if troublesome for anyone else.
:{{DIcon}} What about those leviathans?
::'''Huixing:''' I've been fascinated by marine biology since I was a child. Especially those behemoths hidden deep beneath the waves...
::'''Huixing:''' To be honest, I signed up for this job precisely because I'd heard that Captain Beidou slew [[Haishan]].
::'''Huixing:''' More's the pity that I haven't had the chance to see a leviathan with my own eyes. I'd really love to see one up close some day.
::'''Huixing:''' I've also heard some sailors say that they saw something like giant antennae around the Sea of Clouds...
::'''Huixing:''' ...Is that true or not? Who knows. Perhaps they were just seeing things while dead drunk.
:{{DIcon}} How's the symbol deciphering coming along?
:;(After completing [[Setting Sail]])
::'''Huixing:''' Ah, ahoy there, Traveler! Welcome aboard the Alcor!
::'''Huixing:''' It's been quite tough, I won't lie, but it's gone well enough. We've obtained quite a lot of nautical maps from various sources, so a full deciphering will take some time.
::'''Huixing:''' I've heard that you're quite the code-breaker and puzzle-solver yourself. If I had your help, this would probably be much easier...
::'''Huixing:''' ...Well, when you're free, of course! Also, feel free to tell me if you need anything!
:{{DIcon}} Well, see you, then.
::'''Huixing:''' I swear I'll become a navigator who actually does documentation...
{{Dialogue end}}
