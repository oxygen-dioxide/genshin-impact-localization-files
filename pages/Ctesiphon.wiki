: {{DIcon|Idle}} Assigning work...

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ctesiphon:''' From the planting, picking, and processing of tea to transportation and sale... How is the work distributed in such a complex chain of trade?
:{{DIcon}} Why are you researching all this?
::'''Ctesiphon:''' Hah! See, now you're asking the right questions.
::'''Ctesiphon:''' I'm Ctesiphon, a researcher from the [[Akademiya]] [[Vahumana]], and I'm currently studying the unique ecosystem of the tea trade in Chenyu Vale.
::'''Ctesiphon:''' I have to say, the reasoning behind the tea farmers, teahouses, the Communications Office, and other organizations' distribution of work is quite ingenious...
::'''Ctesiphon:''' To produce crops of the same quality and do so at scale, it's necessary to study the proper division of labor...
:{{DIcon}} You want to learn how to grow tea too?
::'''Ctesiphon:''' The important thing isn't the tea itself, but an organizational model capable of mass-producing high-quality cash crops sustainably over long periods.
:{{DIcon}} I shall take my leave.
::'''Ctesiphon:''' Ah! It seemed someone wanted to speak to me just now, yet was scared off by what I was muttering about... Are organizational questions that scary?
