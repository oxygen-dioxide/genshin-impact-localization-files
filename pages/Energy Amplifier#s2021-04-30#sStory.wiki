{{Description|[[Yingzhu]] of the [[Adventurers' Guild]] has been having dealings with a scholar from the [[Sumeru Academia]], but things seem to be going downhill, fast...}}

The '''Energy Amplifier Initiation''' event takes place in [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]].

==Summary==
{{Main|Mr. Melancholy}}

The Adventurers' Guild in Liyue was commissioned by [[Sumeru Academia]] to investigate a ruin, wherein they found a perfectly preserved Irminsul Fruit. Piqued by this rare discover, the Academia sent Hosseini, a student researching Irminsul Fruits, to bring it back to Sumeru. However, en route, the group was attacked by [[Treasure Hoarders]] and when the cart containing the Irminusl Fruit was hit, the fruit exploded into fragments that flew into dangerous domains in Mondstadt and Liyue, while some were taken away by monsters.

The Traveler and Paimon find a despairing Hosseini and a representative of the Adventurers' Guild, Yingzhu, in [[Dihua Marsh]] as Yingzhu tries to reassure him on the fate of his thesis subject. They agree to search for the missing fragments, and manage to bring back some particularly large ones. Upon discovering that the Traveler had recovered the fragments by defeating the monsters attracted to it, Hosseini decides to entrust them with the Energy Amplifier, which can draw on the Irminsul Fruit Fragments' power, to gather data on the monsters in the domains.
