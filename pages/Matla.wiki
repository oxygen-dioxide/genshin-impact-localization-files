==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Matla:''' Sorry, but I need to clear out some... mental detritus before I head down to the clinic.
:{{DIcon}} Mental... detritus?
::'''Matla:''' Hmm, too direct? How about "mental load"? Would that be easier to understand?
::'''Matla:''' Many people gain greater self-awareness or deeper knowledge through meditation.
::'''Matla:''' But I'm not looking for anything quite so profound. All I require is inner peace.
::{{DIcon}} Is something troubling you?
::'''Matla:''' Know that sometimes, helping other with their treatment is no different from becoming an active part of their lives.
::'''Matla:''' This is especially true for those who have chronic illnesses, such as those afflicted with [[Abyss]]al corrosion.
::'''Matla:''' In such cases, I {{sic|regular}} compile medical reports and keep a running record of their condition. As such, it is inevitable that I occasionally find myself dwelling upon such thoughts.
::'''Matla:''' Yet this can have negative effects on my own health.
::'''Matla:''' It is hard for doctors to cure themselves, though, so all I can hope for is to temporarily free my mind of these troubles through meditation.
:{{DIcon}} I wish you luck.
::'''Matla:''' My thanks.
