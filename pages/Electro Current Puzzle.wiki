'''Electro Current Puzzles''' are mechanisms found in [[Inazuma]]. They contain three types of stones:
* '''Discharge Stone:''' Shoots harmless electric current
* '''Relay Stone:''' Repeats the current released by Discharge Stones
* '''Cumulation Stone:''' Absorbs electrical energy from Discharge Stone

Relay Stones may be picked up with {{Key|F}} and placed with {{Key|T}} in order to facilitate transferring the current from the Discharge Stone to the Cumulation Stone. Relay Stones can be placed in mid air. Moving too far from the puzzle will reset the Relay Stone's positions. When the electric current released from the Discharge Stone reaches the Cumulation Stone, the puzzle will be completed to obtain rewards. If the distance between the Discharge and Relay Stones is too large, current will not flow. Once the puzzle is complete, its corresponding Relay Stones will disappear.

In addition to the Relay Stone, Players, enemies, and materials that are imbued with {{Electro}} can conduct current. [[Beidou]]'s [[Tidecaller]] and [[Razor]]'s [[Lightning Fang]] can be used as in case the player does not want to get all Relay Stones or if the puzzle cannot be easily solved with the existing Relay Stones alone. However, most enemies are not near these puzzles, with the exceptions of slimes for two of these puzzles to conduct current.
