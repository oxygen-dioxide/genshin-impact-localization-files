'''The Steambird''' is the main newspaper of the [[Court of Fontaine]]<ref name="Mona Story">{{Ref/CS|Mona|All Things Astrological}}</ref> and is read all across [[Teyvat]].

==All Things Astrological==
'''Columnist:''' [[Mona]]

As the former Astrology columnist sought to retire, he recommended Mona to the editor. Mona's style of writing was much more academic and complicated than her predecessor, but it drew in readers who became interested in the intricacies of astrology.<ref name="Mona Story" /> She has written a manuscript for The Steambird on "celestial shifts and their relation to a person's changing fates."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Owe Mora, Pay Mora|note=Mona's version}}</ref>

==Teyvat Food Notes==
{{main|Teyvat Food Notes}}

'''Columnist:''' {{Lang|Long'er|zh=龙二|zh_rm=Lóng'èr}} (the [[Traveler]], not [[Ryuuji]])

The official Chinese ''Genshin Impact'' website publishes a series of blog posts originally entitled {{lang|"The Steambird: Teyvat Food Notes"|zh=蒸汽鸟报社｜提瓦特美食札记}}, although they were later truncated to simply "Teyvat Food Notes." They contain real-life recipes for in-game [[food]]s and are written by Long'er, their version of the Traveler (specifically Aether), and the stories are written in-character as Long'er prepares the recipes with the featured character(s).

==Reporters==
* [[Gaston]]

==Trivia==
* Completely unbeknownst to the [[Traveler]], The Steambird reported on their battle against [[Dvalin]], and the topic was incredibly popular among readers: it made headlines for three weeks, and the articles on it included expert interviews and high-quality hand-drawn illustrations.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Evermotion Mechanical Painting (Quest)}}</ref> The newspaper characterized the Traveler as "a straight-shooting knight-errant who prefers to let their blade do the talking."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Evermotion Mechanical Painting: Finale}}</ref>
