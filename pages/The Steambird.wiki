'''Columnist:''' {{Lang|Long'er|zh=龙二|zh_rm=Lóng'èr}} (the [[Traveler]])

The official Chinese ''Genshin Impact'' website publishes a series of blog posts originally entitled {{lang|"The Steambird: Teyvat Food Notes"|zh=蒸汽鸟报社｜提瓦特美食札记}}, although they were later truncated to simply "Teyvat Food Notes." They contain real-life recipes for in-game [[food]]s and are written by Long'er, their version of the Traveler (specifically Aether), and the stories are written in-character as Long'er prepares the recipes with the featured character(s).
