[[Version 4.1]]
* After [[Crafting]], [[Converting]], [[Forging]], [[Cooking]], or [[Creating]] furnishings, the formula selection interface will no longer move so that the selected formula appears at the bottom, and will instead align the interface so that the selected formula is in the middle of the screen. Moreover, formulas for which the player runs out of materials will not immediately be moved to the bottom of the list; the list will only be updated after switching to another screen.<!--Processing was not updated for the latter, and I cannot test for the former as there are not enough processing recipes to fill the entire screen. Mystic Offering was not updated for the former, and I will not sacrifice my entire 5-star artifact stash to test whether it does the latter.-->
* When picking a character to assist a Crafting Method process, the currently selected character will appear at the top of the list instead of at their place according to their available [[Utility Passive#Bonuses on Crafting Methods|Utility Passive]] bonus or obtainment order.

[[Version 2.4]]
* Adjusts the display of the Crafting, Converting and Forging interfaces from a single-column list to a grid.
