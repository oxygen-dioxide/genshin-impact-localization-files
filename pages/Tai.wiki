==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tai:''' Ho there, come and have a look. Each item here is a treasure you shall find in few other places!
:{{DIcon}} What are your wares?
::'''Tai:''' Interested, are we? Well then, allow me to tell you a little something&mdash;
::'''Tai:''' Look at this porcelain bottle, if you will. It may look plain, but it is a true relic, perhaps worth as much as half of Chihu Rock!
::'''Tai:''' And this censer &mdash; legend has it that it has offered incense to [[Rex Lapis]] himself for a thousand years, and has become filled with adeptal energy in the process!
::'''Tai:''' And have I mentioned this teapot? Why, it was once used by Rex Lapis himself. You will never find another like it...
::{{DIcon}} How much for these?
::'''Tai:''' How much? Oh no, I never said I was selling. In fact, you couldn't make me sell these.
::{{DIcon}} So what's with the shop if you're not selling?
::'''Tai:''' Ha, that's a good one. Whoever said that a shop must needs hawk wares?
::'''Tai:''' I bought this store here precisely to show these beauties off to any who would pass by.
::'''Tai:''' Every day, some ignorant bystanders like you will come by and ask me these questions. That said, this is precisely what I want...
:{{DIcon}} I'm good, bye.
::'''Tai:''' Sure. Come again if you have time to spare, and I'll spin you another yarn!
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* In the Indonesian translation, the spelling of his name is altered to "Thai" because "tai" is a swear word in Indonesian, the equivalent of "shit" in English.
