|text    = Not long ago, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] kept asking me to visit the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]], to borrow books or attend lectures to immerse in the academic atmosphere. I was annoyed by this and wandered around the wilderness, but she still managed to find me. She said she understood that I don't like being around others, but it can be very painful being alone all the time. She also said at least I could see you if I bring you something on my birthday.

But why should I give someone a present when it's my birthday? How absurd.

I can see that she was looking for a chance to make my life more fulfilling, but has she ever stopped to think about what an "experience" it is for others to meet me?

Anyway, I ran into some students by the road, and they dragged me into joining some cooking interest group. We ended up making a lot of food that is not to my taste, so I'm definitely not eating them. You can take the rest, eat it if you like it, throw it away if you don't. I have no interest in knowing what you do with it, you don't have to tell me.
