==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Hajanad is a determined alchemist who strives to explore the full potential of alchemy, so that she can prove her worth to others and live a better life.

===Personality===
During [[The Cliffside Weirdo and a Risky Study?]], Hajanad was rather vehement about her project, which led Paimon to think she was "a real meanie". Hajanad, however, does some self-reflection after her conversation with the Traveler and Paimon, and tells them that she plans on working on her behavior, as she had been so absorbed by her research that she forgot how to act around others.

Hajanad is also willing to eat only once per day, which Paimon is appalled by, to further her research on potions, showing that she is quite dedicated to her vocation as an alchemist.

===Appearance===
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 2 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Hajanad wears the typical attire of a female student in [[Spantamad]]. She is of average height and build with brown eyes and fair skin. She has straight brown hair that is cut in a bob with a fringe that covers her forehead.
