{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Electricity
|desc_1 = When electricity is present on a Large Electro Slime (indicated when its "antenna" is glowing), it will be inflicted with {{Electro}} at all times, and its attacks will deal {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* A Large Electro Slime starts with and can possess a maximum of 8 gauges of electricity.
* Triggering [[Elemental Reactions]] on an Electro Slime will consume gauges of electricity. Every 1 [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge]] of {{Cryo}}/{{Pyro}}/{{Dendro}}, or 2 gauges of {{Geo}}/{{Anemo}} applied to the Electro Slime will consume 1 gauge of electricity.
* Additionally, every time the slime takes {{Color|Electro DMG}}, it will gain full electricity, regardless of the amount of Electro gauges applied. Therefore, due to the [[Swirl]] and [[Electro-Charged]] reaction's ability to deal {{Color|Electro DMG}}, {{Anemo}} or {{Hydro}} on their own will never be able to deplete the Electro Slime's electricity.
* '''Shock:''' Periodically consumes 1 gauge of '''electricity''' and releases a shockwave, dealing '''33.3% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} around itself. This attack deals DMG to both enemies and allies.
* '''Recharge:''' After a period of time has passed since '''electricity''' ran out, recharges to once again gain 8 gauges of '''electricity'''.

|name_2 = Bump
|desc_2 = Bumps into the player, dealing '''33.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} if '''electricity''' is present or {{Color|Physical DMG}} if '''electricity''' is not present.

|name_3 = Leap
|desc_3 = Leaps high into the air before slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} if '''electricity''' is present or '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}} if '''electricity''' is not present. Additionally, if '''electricity''' is not present, this attack has a very limited range and will not highlight the impact area.
* Certain enhanced Large Electro Slimes, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges, have reduced [[Cooldown]] on this attack.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A monster created by the coalescing of Electro dispersed throughout nature.<br />Due to the abundant Electro within its form, it will deliver an electric shock to its surroundings from time to time. At present, some have attempted to harness this energy to aid in production activities. Perhaps some new science will be born from this...?|[[Archive]]}}
