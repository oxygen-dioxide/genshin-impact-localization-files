==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Delaroche:''' Patience, patience... This is just a test of my patience...
:'''Delaroche:''' As the director of the Fishing Association, I must remain by my post here at the fishing point &mdash; I shall defeat these Linebreakers with my unbending will!
:{{DIcon|Fishing Supplies}} Never mind that for now. I'd like to purchase some fishing supplies.
::'''Delaroche:''' Oh sure, of course! Take your pick!
:;(Opens the [[#Shop|Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} How's the haul?
:;(Before completing [[Delaroche's Bait]])
::'''Delaroche:''' Why, hello there! Thanks for your concern!
::'''Delaroche:''' As you can see, I'm having a hard time with these Linebreakers, these fighters who dwell underwater. I haven't really had much success yet.
::'''Delaroche:''' But so long as I keep my head down and keep at it, believe me, I shall eventually earn my victory!
:{{DIcon}} How's your recent catches been?
:;(After completing [[Delaroche's Bait]], if the player chose to rationally explain to her)
::'''Delaroche:''' Ah! The God of Victorious Linebreaking! We meet again!
::'''Delaroche:''' I've been steadily improving my bait recently, and think I've come a long way. I've even caught several... somewhat larger fish!
::'''Delaroche:''' I still don't think I've managed to create the ideal bait, however, so I don't have anything to give you...
::'''Delaroche:''' But please, don't worry! At this rate, I know I'll be able to recreate that wonderful bait sooner or later!
:{{DIcon}} You really did bring a weapon!
:;(After completing [[Delaroche's Bait]], if the player chose to scare her)
::'''Delaroche:''' Hehe, that's right! I asked a friend at the Adventurer's Guild to procure it. Apparently, it's a foreign model...
::'''Delaroche:''' While it's not as elegant to use as pistolets, it's simple, cheap, and easy to maintain.
::'''Delaroche:''' O strange aquatic creature, you'd better pray I don't catch you. Otherwise, special treatment shall be in order!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Delaroche:''' I'm the current director of the Fontaine Fishing Association, Delaroche! If you have any questions about fishing, you can come to me!
::'''Delaroche:''' Ah, but I refer to fishing equipment and material. As for techniques, tips, and tricks, I shall not haphazardly instruct others.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I shan't bother you, then.
::'''Delaroche:''' Huh? Wait. Did you ask me something? Sorry, I didn't notice you there &mdash; I won't do that again, trust me!
