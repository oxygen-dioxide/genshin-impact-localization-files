The '''Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale''', also succinctly addressed as the '''Oratrice''', is a large mechanical {{w|weighing scale}} located in the [[Court of Fontaine]]'s [[Opera Epiclese (Instance)|Opera Epiclese]], created by [[Focalors]]. It converts people's belief in justice into Indemnitium, a power source used in the Court of Fontaine and [[Erinnyes]].<ref name="4-0">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/2E73BKNtOXI Version 4.0 Special Program]</ref>

Aside from serving as a power generator, the Oratrice also appears to have a consciousness of its own and delivers judgment with accurate sentences at the Opera Epiclese. How and why the Oratrice can do this are the subjects of [[Lyney]]'s curiosity and he theorizes it may have something to do with the prophesied crisis.<ref name="4-0" /> Regardless of what the [[Neuvillette|Chief Justice]] believes during the trial, they must honor the results of the Oratrice.

It is later revealed that Focalors was contained within the Oratrice and that only a fraction of Indemnitium produced by the Oratrice was ever used to power Fontaine; in reality, most of it went to give the Oratrice enough power to execute Focalors and destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne. This action returned the Hydro Archon's power to the [[Hydro Dragon]] to forgive the people of Fontaine of its "Original Sin" and save them from the [[prophecy]].

==Overview==
[[Fontaine]] runs on a "very special" energy system and has been plagued with power issues for centuries, which has led Fontainians to be concerned for the sustainability of this system.<ref name="Bertrand">{{Ref/Quest|A-Toymaking We Shall Go: Core Propulsion|quote='''[[Bertrand]]:''' The energy system there is very special, and no one knows how long it can be sustained. Thus, we must find alternative energy solutions before it all comes crashing down.}}</ref> The Oratrice collects people's belief in "justice" during the "process of 'judgment'" and turns it into Indemnitium, which provides energy for various amenities in Fontaine, including lamps and transportation systems.<ref name="4-0" /> It is later revealed that only a small fraction of the Indemnitium was ever used to power Fontaine; if it were not for Focalors' own plan, the amount of energy that the Oratrice had accumulated over 500 years would have been able to power Fontaine for millennia.

An impending energy crisis between 400 and 500 years ago led [[Rene]] and [[Jakob]], two members of the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]], to search for a solution in the [[Khaenri'ah]]n ruins at the [[Girdle of the Sands]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Rene's Investigation Notes}}</ref> Their discoveries were brought back to [[Alain Guillotin]], who went on to devise the Pneuma-Ousia [[Arkhe]] system which continues to power the [[Clockwork Meka]] to this day.<ref name="4-0" />

Settlements such as the Court of Fontaine and the island of Erinnyes continue to be powered by the Oratrice.<ref name="4-0" /> Even with the Arkhe system in place, wholly replacing the Oratrice has been difficult and research into alternate energy systems has continued. While members of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] are focused on developing entirely new systems,<ref name="Bertrand" /> Lyney appears to believe the mysteries behind the Oratrice are the key to resolving Fontaine's issues.<ref name="4-0" />

During the trial against Lyney and [[Lynette]] by [[Furina]], the Oratrice listened to the case then shifting its scales after hearing arguments and objections from both sides. After learning that the entire trial was an accident caused by [[Liliane]] and that [[Cowell]] was the actual perpetrator, the Oratrice gave a non-guilty verdict to both him and [[Lynette]]. Lyney attempted to investigate the Oratrice per [[The Knave|Father's]] request, but was forced to retreat when he heard a voice from the Oratrice that appeared to know him, which also contaminated him with a large quantity of Indemnitium.

During the events of ''[[As Light Rain Falls Without Reason]]'', the Oratrice ended up giving a guilty verdict to [[Tartaglia]] despite having been cleared of charges stemming from the mysterious disappearance cases, leaving both Neuvillette and Furina surprised and baffled by the result, as it was the first time since its operation it did not agree with the Chief Justice's view. This prompted Neuvillette to personally investigate the machine and Tartaglia's case himself while Furina managed to cover up the machine's error through dramatics and bravado. Through his investigations, Neuvillette discovered that Childe had fallen into the [[Abyss]] when he was younger and accidentally awakened the [[All-Devouring Narwhal]], but remained unconvinced that that was the reason the machine declared him guilty, offering the possibility that Focalors was deliberately using him to buy time by holding the All-Devouring Narwhal off.

When [[The Knave|Arlecchino]] had a meeting with Furina (as a tea party), after Neuvillette had sealed the [[Primordial Sea]] from engulfing Fontaine, she asked her about her plan to stop the [[prophecy]]. Furina claimed that she had a plan, though Arlecchino doubted her claim. Based on what she had learned from Lyney, she surmised that someone was accumulating Indemnitium for an unknown cause but did not go further into the matter and quickly changed the subject.

As the prophecy began to loom over Fontaine, the Traveler and Neuvillette concocted a "trap" to make Furina reveal her hidden secrets to avoid it. The Traveler deduced her of being a fraud, gaining the support of the audience through various evidence they obtained in their encounters. The Oratrice agreed with Neuvillette's judgment of her being guilty, but gave a verdict condemning "the Hydro Archon" to the death sentence, even though the trial was held precisely to prove that Furina was not the Archon, surprising everyone present. The death sentence in particular caused much shock and horror for the audience as it was a penalty that was never been handed out before, to the point that some thought its availability was a mere myth.

Focalors later met with Neuvillette inside of her consciousness, revealing her intricate plan to deceive the [[Heavenly Principles]] and save their people; The Oratrice was never an enactor of justice and instead a device to kill the God of Justice, constantly accumulating Indemnitium within the Oratrice in the last 500 years. Focalors would use the acquired Indemnitium to kill herself and destroy the Hydro Archon's Divine Throne, restoring Neuvillette's full authority as the Hydro Dragon Sovereign. Neuvillette also realized that the Oratrice's call for the death sentence of "Hydro Archon" refers to neither Furina or Focalors, but to the Divine Throne of Hydro Archon itself. After Focalors executed herself, the Oratrice is now non-functional and no longer provides Indemnitium for Fontaine's needs,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref> though Neuvillette's restored authority allowed him complete control over Pneumousia energy to serve as a substitute for the time being. Neuvillette also decided to take over its role in court trials and he will personally hear all cases and pass verdicts going forward.
