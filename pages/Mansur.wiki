==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mansur:''' I never thought that ironworking would be so much more interesting than writing essays...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Mansur:''' I'm a researcher from the [[Akademiya]]'s {{Rubi|[[Amurta]]|Biology}}, I came to the blacksmith's because I'm being oppre&mdash; uh, I mean, I'm doing some research for a paper I'm writing on air pollution.
::'''Mansur:''' Anyway, I never imagined that I would develop such an interest in ironworking after having a look at it, and I unwittingly became Mr. [[Ahangar]]'s apprentice...
::'''Mansur:''' It seems a little too late to back out now. Mr. Ahangar adopted a lot of kids, but they all either became researchers or joined the Eremites.
::'''Mansur:''' And yet somehow, a researcher like me who worries over their dissertation all day has now become the only heir to his craft...
::'''Mansur:''' Still, I'm telling you, ironworking is a heck of a lot more fun than writing papers. Not only has my stamina improved, my hair's even stopped falling out.
::{{DIcon}} What do you plan to do next?
:::'''Mansur:''' Well, at the moment, I'm simultaneously keeping the serious air pollution problem at the blacksmith's from the Akademiya while prolonging my internship here with Mr. Ahangar...
:::'''Mansur:''' Mr. Ahangar looked quite pleased to finally have an apprentice. I can get by well enough on my wages, so I guess I'll just take it one step at a time for now.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} What about the thesis?
::::'''Mansur:''' Oh please...
::::'''Mansur:''' Now take this... as uh, hush money! Please stop asking me about the thesis. I get a headache just hearing it.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|White Iron Chunk|20|x=10}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Mansur:''' See you.
