{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Elemental Conversion
|desc_1 = After reaching '''40%''' HP or after enough time has passed, the Geovishap will draw elemental energy from its environment to absorb either {{Cryo}}, {{Electro}}, {{Hydro}} or {{Pyro}}, gaining a persistent elemental aura and enhancing some of its attacks based on the element absorbed. In the overworld, the conversion is usually based on its surroundings; e.g a {{Pyro}} infusion if [[Flaming Flower]]s are nearby.

|name_2 = Charge Attack
|desc_2 = The Geovishap curls up into a ball and charges towards the player's location, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. Subsequently, if this attack hits the player, it will perform a single jump attack, dealing '''85% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. If the Geovishap crashes into a player protected by a shield, it will get knocked out of its rolling state and become stunned for a few seconds.
* {{Cryo}}: Rolling DMG type converted to Cryo; Jump attack landing will create three ice mines around it. The mines will explode after a while or when a character comes into contact with them, dealing '''35% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
* {{Pyro}}: Rolling and jump attack DMG type converted to Pyro; Jump attack DMG increased to '''100% ATK''' and summons spikes around it to deal '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} in a ring-shaped AoE shortly after landing.
* {{Electro}}: Rolling DMG type converted to Electro; Jump attack landing will send out three {{Electro}} orbs that fly around erratically for a few seconds before dissipating. Coming into contact with these orbs deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* {{Hydro}}: Rolling DMG type converted to Hydro. Jump attack landing visibly marks the player. The mark will follow the player for several seconds before becoming stationary, giving the player the opportunity to avoid the attack. It then explodes to deal '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.

* {{Cryo}}: Each landing causes three ice mines to appear on the ground around the Geovishap. The mines explode after a while or when a character comes into contact with them, dealing '''35% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} after a few seconds.
* {{Pyro}}: DMG type converted to Pyro; DMG increased to '''50% ATK''' and '''70% ATK'''; Briefly after landing, summons spikes around it that deal '''50% ATK''' and '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} in ring-shaped AoEs around the landing area, respectively.
* {{Electro}}: The first and second jump attacks will send 3 and 4 {{Electro}} orbs outward that fly around erratically for a few seconds before dissipating, respectively. Coming into contact with these orbs will deal '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* {{Hydro}}: After landing, visibly marks the player. The mark will follow the player for several seconds before becoming stationary, giving the player the opportunity to avoid the attack. It then explodes to deal '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.

|desc_4 = The Geovishap approaches the player, and then either performs a slash with its right hand claws or a slam where it will also drag its claw back towards itself, dealing '''50% ATK''' and '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}, respectively. The punch will also knock the player towards it. While infused with any element, the slash and punch will be performed in quick succession.

====AI Logic====
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range and angle required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with all nearby Geovishaps.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A mature Geovishap.<br>It is said that after many years have passed, [[Geovishap Hatchling]]s will shed the armor that originally protected them and become Geovishaps. However these two and the older, greater [[Primo Geovishap]]s have spent many years hibernating under the mountains, and have only emerged and become active in recent times. As such, none can personally attest to have witnessed or recorded such a thing in person.|[[Adventurer Handbook]] and [[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* The name Geovishap derives from the Greek prefix {{wt|γῆ|geo-|Ancient_Greek}} and {{Lang|{{w|vishap}}|hy=վիշապ|hy_rm=vishap}}, a dragon in Armenian mythology.
