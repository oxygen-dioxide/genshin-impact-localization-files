{{Description|A mature Geovishap. It is said that after many years have passed, Geovishap Hatchlings will shed the armor that originally protected them and become Geovishaps. However these two and the older, greater [[Primo Geovishap]]s have spent many years hibernating under the mountains and have only emerged and become active in recent times. As such, none can personally attest to have witnessed or recorded such a thing in person.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
When the battle with the Geovishap starts, it does not have any elemental infusion. All attacks will deal {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

After reaching '''40%''' HP or after some time has passed, the Geovishap will infuse itself with either {{Cryo}}, {{Electro}}, {{Hydro}} or {{Pyro}}. The attacks may vary depending on the elemental variant of the Geovishap.

* '''Charge Attack''': The Geovishap curls up into a ball and charges towards the player's location, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. Subsequently, if this attack hits the player, it will perform a single jump attack, dealing '''170% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.
** {{Cryo}}: DMG type converted to Cryo.
** {{Pyro}}: DMG type converted to Pyro; Jump attack DMG increased to '''200% ATK'''.
** {{Electro}}: DMG type converted to Electro.
** {{Hydro}}: DMG type converted to Hydro.

* '''Jump Attack''': The Geovishap will perform two jump attacks, jumping in the air and landing on the player's location, dealing '''80% ATK''' and '''120% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. After this attack, it will temporarily be stunned for a couple seconds.
** {{Cryo}}: After landing, several spots will appear on the ground near the Geovishap that will explode and deal '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} after a few seconds.
** {{Pyro}}: DMG type converted to Pyro; DMG increased to '''100% ATK''' and '''140% ATK'''; Briefly after landing, summons spikes around it that deal '''140% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}.
** {{Electro}}: After landing, it sends out several {{Electro}} orbs that fly around for a few seconds before dissipating, coming into contact with these orbs will deal '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
** {{Hydro}}: After landing, visibly marks the player. The mark will follow the player for several seconds before becoming stationary, giving the player the opportunity to avoid the attack, and then explodes dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.

* '''Slash and Punch''': The Geovishap approaches the player and performs a slash with its right hand claws and then punch its left hand into the ground in front if it, dealing '''80% ATK''' and '''120% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.
** {{Cryo}}: After the attack, several spots will appear on the ground near the Geovishap that will explode and deal '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} after a few seconds.
** {{Pyro}}: DMG type converted to Pyro; DMG increased to '''100% ATK''' and '''120% ATK'''.
** {{Electro}}: The punch will send out two {{Electro}} orbs that fly around for a few seconds before dissipating, coming into contact with these orbs will deal '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
** {{Hydro}}: After the punch, visibly marks the player. The mark will follow the player for several seconds before becoming stationary, giving the player the opportunity to avoid the attack, and then explodes dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.

* '''Spike Attack''': The Geovishap will slam its right hand onto the ground sending out a line of small spikes coming out of the ground towards the player's location, and its left hand sending out another line of spikes, then with both hands sending out two lines. Each spike deals '''33% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.
** {{Cryo}}: A ring of spots appears around the Geovishap that will explode and deal '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} after a few seconds.
** {{Pyro}}: DMG type converted to Pyro; Spike DMG increased to '''50% ATK'''.
** {{Electro}}: After the attack, several {{Electro}} orbs will be send out that fly around for a few seconds before dissipating, coming into contact with these orbs will deal '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
** {{Hydro}}: Also visibly marks the player. The mark will follow the player for several seconds before becoming stationary, giving the player the opportunity to avoid the attack, and then explodes dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range and angle required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with all nearby Geovishaps.

==Strategy==
Unlike [[Geovishap Hatchling]]s, Geovishaps do not have the ability to burrow themselves to avoid incoming attacks and are easier to hit. Geovishaps only deal {{Color|Geo DMG}} when unimbued.

As the fight progresses, the Geovishap will slam both of its fists into the ground and infuse itself with either {{Cryo}}, {{Electro}}, {{Hydro}} or {{Pyro}}. This infusion is always the same for each specific location, and hints can be provided for overworld Geovishaps with the surrounding area. Look out for nearby a [[Electro Crystal]], [[Flaming Flower Stamen|Flaming Flower]], [[Mist Flower Corolla|Mist Flower]], or bodies of water to determine the element it will obtain. The infusion makes the Geovishaps attacks deal DMG of said element, but it also permanently applies the same element onto them, allowing for a myriad of [[Elemental Reactions]] to be used for additional DMG.

While the Geovishap is performing '''Charge Attack''', it may be stunned temporarily if it hits a player protected by a [[Shields|shield]].

==Locations==
The Geovishap can be found through the [[Adventurer Handbook]]. Keep in mind that they can often spawn with a [[Geovishap Hatchling]] nearby, so you may have to deal with that as well.

They can also be found through "On the Hunt" challenges from the [[Vishaps and Where to Find Them]] event.

==Trivia==
* The name Geovishap derives from the Greek prefix {{wt|γῆ|geo-|Ancient_Greek}} and {{Lang|{{w|vishap}}|hy=վիշապ|hy_rm=vishap}}, a dragon in Armenian mythology.
