===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range and angle required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with all nearby Geovishaps.

==Strategy==
Unlike [[Geovishap Hatchling]]s, Geovishaps do not have the ability to burrow themselves to avoid incoming attacks and are easier to hit. Geovishaps only deal {{Color|Geo DMG}} when unimbued.

As the fight progresses, the Geovishap will slam both of its fists into the ground and infuse itself with either {{Cryo}}, {{Electro}}, {{Hydro}} or {{Pyro}}. This infusion is always the same for each specific location, and hints can be provided for overworld Geovishaps with the surrounding area. Look out for nearby a [[Electro Crystal]], [[Flaming Flower Stamen|Flaming Flower]], [[Mist Flower Corolla|Mist Flower]], or bodies of water to determine the element it will obtain. The infusion makes the Geovishaps attacks deal DMG of said element, but it also permanently applies the same element onto them, allowing for a myriad of [[Elemental Reactions]] to be used for additional DMG.

While the Geovishap is performing '''Charge Attack''', it may be stunned temporarily if it hits a player protected by a [[Shields|shield]].

==Locations==
The Geovishap can be found through the [[Adventurer Handbook]]. Keep in mind that they can often spawn with a [[Geovishap Hatchling]] nearby, so you may have to deal with that as well.

They can also be found through "On the Hunt" challenges from the [[Vishaps and Where to Find Them]] event.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A mature Geovishap.<br />It is said that after many years have passed, [[Geovishap Hatchling]]s will shed the armor that originally protected them and become Geovishaps. However these two and the older, greater [[Primo Geovishap]]s have spent many years hibernating under the mountains and have only emerged and become active in recent times. As such, none can personally attest to have witnessed or recorded such a thing in person.|[[Adventurer Handbook]] and [[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* The name Geovishap derives from the Greek prefix {{wt|γῆ|geo-|Ancient_Greek}} and {{Lang|{{w|vishap}}|hy=վիշապ|hy_rm=vishap}}, a dragon in Armenian mythology.
