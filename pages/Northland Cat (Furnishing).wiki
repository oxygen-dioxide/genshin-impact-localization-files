|description    = An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br>This graceful cat has a base coat of gray-white fur that is streaked with black. It is native to the distant far north and is well-known for its gentle character and companionable nature.<br>After arriving in the Realm Within, these laid-back kitties can often be found accompanying others that also hail from the north, or leisurely spending the day lying in the sunlight beside the window.
