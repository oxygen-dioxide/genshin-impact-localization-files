{{Description|A sword made from materials that do not belong in this world. The power within might even be able to withstand the corruption of a venom that could corrode a mighty dragon.}}
'''Cinnabar Spindle''' is an Event-Exclusive 4-Star [[Sword]]. It can be obtained during the "[[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]]" event after making the first Puffy Snowman. It cannot be used to enhance another weapon as only one copy can be obtained.

==Ascensions and Stats==

==Refinement==
Refining '''Cinnabar Spindle''' requires [[Alkahest]] instead of an identical weapon. It can be obtained through the [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]] Event Shop after completing the Dragonspine Special.

==Notes==
*'''Spotless Heart''' can activate even if the wielder of the Cinnabar Spindle is off field.

==Description==
Separate the dust in the flames with joy, and extract the exquisite from the crude.<br />
For all in the universe comes from a single source, and all things may be derived from a single thought.<br />
You must pursue that which your elder brother, the one-horned white horse, could not accomplish.<br />
Reach the far side of philosophy, and create a new destiny for myself and your brothers...

==Trivia==
* [[Albedo]] uses this blade in cutscenes throughout the Shadows Amidst Snowstorms event. In addition to matching his color scheme and complimenting his stats, the sword's description could be interpreted as a reference to his master [[Rhinedottir]] and her [[Primordial Albedo|creations]].

===Known Issues===
*If Elemental Skill hits a shielded enemy without dealing damage, '''Spotless Heart''' may stop working indefinitely until the weapon is unequipped and reequipped.
