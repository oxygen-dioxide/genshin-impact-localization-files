{{Description|A sword made from materials that do not belong in this world. The power within might even be able to withstand the corruption of a venom that could corrode a mighty dragon.}}
'''Cinnabar Spindle''' is a 4-Star sword obtainable from the [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]] event.

==Ascensions and Stats==

==Refinement==
Refining '''Cinnabar Spindle''' requires its refinement material {{Item|Alkahest}} instead of identical weapons, 4 of which can be obtained through the [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]] Event.

==Gameplay Notes==
*'''Spotless Heart''' can activate even if the wielder of the Cinnabar Spindle is off field.

===Known Issues===
*If the holder's Elemental Skill hits a shielded enemy without dealing damage, the passive '''Spotless Heart''' may stop working indefinitely until the weapon is unequipped and re-equipped, the holder is swapped out of the party and back in again, or the game is restarted {{Verify|Check if this bug has been fixed; If not, check if these given workarounds here work.}}

==Description==
Separate the dust in the flames with joy, and extract the exquisite from the crude.<br>
For all in the universe comes from a single source, and all things may be derived from a single thought.<br>
[[Albedo|You]] must pursue that which your elder brother, the one-horned white horse, could not accomplish.<br>
Reach the far side of philosophy, and create a new destiny for [[Rhinedottir|myself]] and your brothers...

==Availability==
* Obtained during the [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]] event.

==Trivia==
* [[Albedo]] is seen using this blade in cutscenes throughout the Shadows Amidst Snowstorms event. In addition to matching his color scheme, the sword's description could be interpreted as a reference to his master, [[Rhinedottir]], and her creations such as [[Primordial Albedo]].
* {{w|Cinnabar}} is the most common ore of the element {{w|Mercury (element)|mercury}}. Chinese alchemists of the Tang dynasty regarded cinnabar as one of the elements of the elixir of immortality, and more generally alchemy regarded mercury as one of the three principle substances alongside sulfur and salt, assigning it many mystical properties.
* This weapon's refinement material, {{w|Alkahest}}, was a theorized "universal solvent" sought-after by alchemists starting around the 15th century and said to be able to separate any material into its pure constituents.
* This sword's short description mirrors that of [[Festering Desire]], as both weapons are related in many ways.
