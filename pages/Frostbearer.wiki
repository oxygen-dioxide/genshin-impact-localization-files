==Description==
When the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|daughter of the priestess of Vindagnyr]] was born beneath this white tree,<br />
The kingdom in the verdant mountain was filled with joy when she received her blessing.

Surely, the blessing of [[Sal Vindagnyr]] would be everlasting,<br />
Just as [[Frostbearing Tree|the undying silver-white tree]] whose roots pierced the earth.<br />
That was the hope of [[Ukko|those who wrote the annals]] of that mountain kingdom.<br />
Those who had recorded the tales of countless people and events believed this in their hearts,<br />
That the beauty and skill of their princess would be as eternal and pure as the moonlight.

When the [[Skyfrost Nail|nail that froze the world]] descended suddenly,<br />
And that tree, too, would be shattered by it,<br />
That girl took the most complete branch,<br />
Thinking to breathe new life into the tree that once overshadowed a nation.<br />
But in the end, the grafted life could not flourish.<br />
The cutting snowstorm eventually covered the moonlight like a curtain of countless blades...

A long, long time later, yet still long ago &mdash;<br />
When the deathmatch between the [[Durin|dragons of darkness]] and [[Dvalin|wind]] was decided at last,<br />
When corrosive blood stained the [[Wyrmrest Valley|ashen valley]] red,<br />
The tree, at last, remembered that it had not died with that entombed city,<br />
And it extended its greedy roots towards the warm ichor that irrigated the land.

Because a [[Traveler|certain someone]] poured out a [[Crimson Agate|crimson essence]] upon it,<br />
The tree that should have long died remembered its past,<br />
And bore a single fruit from the coalescence of all its might...

Here, for those who dwelt in my safe shadow, for the priests who eulogized me,<br />
For that lovely maiden who oft painted upon my form,<br />
For all the happiness they could not possess &mdash; I enjoin them all into this crimson, icy fruit.

To the one who can render recompense upon this poisonous world shall it go,<br />
And may they carry my innocent, bitter fruit as they enact justice.

==Availability==
*[[Forging]]
**Its [[diagram]] is obtained from upgrading the [[Frostbearing Tree]] to level 10.

==Trivia==
*This weapon is the only one in the [[Dragonspine Series]] that is exclusively obtained through Forging.
*The phrase "priestess of Vindagnyr" in this weapon's lore is likely a misinterpretation on the English translation's part. The original Chinese term {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|祭司}}}} does not indicate gender, and the rest of Sal Vindagnyr's lore only mentions the princess' father, the chief priest [[Varuch]].
