'''''Language Exchange''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] that occurs in [[Mondstadt]].

==Steps==
# Talk to [[Ella Musk]]
# Go to the hilichurl camp with Ella Musk
# Talk to Ella Musk
# Approach the hilichurl that is awake, but don't wake the others
## (If failed stealth) Kill the annoyed hilichurls
# (Version 2 only) Fend off the annoyed hilichurls
# Talk to Ella Musk

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing this commission for the first time awards the {{Achievement|...Odomu?}}
* Beginning in [[Version 1.4]], ''[[Poetry Exchange]]'' seems to be guaranteed as an emergency Commission on the fourth day after completing the good ending of ''Language Exchange''.
** ''Language Exchange'' can still be received during this time period, including on the same day as the guaranteed ''Poetry Exchange''. Completing the new ''Language Exchange'' does not affect the old ''Language Exchange''{{'}}s follow-up ''Poetry Exchange''. In addition, completing the good ending of the new ''Language Exchange'' will generate a new ''Poetry Exchange'' Commission with the same conditions (received on the fourth day afterward, emergency, etc.).
** It is unclear how the optional and guaranteed bad endings of ''Language Exchange'' affect the generation of ''Poetry Exchange''.
*** The optional bad ending, which can be completed by failing stealth, may generate both a guaranteed ''Poetry Exchange'' four days later as well as an additional ''Poetry Exchange'' afterward. There is currently not enough data found to determine a pattern.
*** No data found on what happens when the guaranteed bad ending is completed.
* There are two versions of the quest's dialogue after successfully approaching the hilichurl: the first ends with successful communication between Ella Musk and the hilichurl, while the second version has Ella accidentally offend the hilichurl and cause the hilichurls in the camp to attack anyways. The version the player receives is determined by the game.
* The most reliable way to approach the hilichurl without [[Aggro|waking]] the others is to switch to Walking mode and approach it slowly to avoid the other hilichurls' detection range.
** When you successfully approach the hilichurl without waking the others, dialogue with it will automatically trigger.
** After the dialogue ends, Ella will immediately be in range to speak with for the last part of the quest; you don't need to move.
** It is possible to wake the hilichurls after the dialogue ends, which will upset them and trigger the prompt to kill the hilichurls. However, it is still possible to complete the commission by luring the hilichurls away from Ella, losing aggro, and then going back to talk to Ella before the hilichurls return. (It may help to defeat some of the hilichurls first, though.)
* It is possible to attack and defeat the sleeping hilichurls in the camp before starting the commission (but not the awake one), but they will respawn when Ella asks you to approach the awake hilichurl. Hilichurls defeated this way do not drop any items, experience, or Mora.
* The hilichurl at the entrance will be invincible before starting the commission and after approaching the camp successfully.
* At certain locations,{{cite}} a bug may occur after speaking to Ella the second time, which launches the Mitachurl at the camp into the sky. When this occurs, it is impossible to fail Step 4, as the Mitachurl has been forcibly moved out of detection range while the other hilichurls are programmed to be unwakeable without the Mitachurl around.

==Rewards==
{{Commission Rewards|full}}

In addition to the regular Commission rewards above, Ella will give 3 [[Suspicious Steak]]s in the first version of the Commission regardless of whether or not she successfully spoke to the awake hilichurl. She does not give any extra rewards in the second version.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Ella Musk wants to find a group of [[hilichurls]] to practice her [[Hilichurlian]]. She claims to have a solid grasp of the basics, as well as plenty of communication experience... It's just that she's never had a chance to actually speak with them.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Ella Musk)
:'''Ella Musk:''' Traveler! Here! Over here!
:'''Ella Musk:''' Don't startle those hilichurls over there. Why are you always running off into hilichurl camps?
:'''Ella Musk:''' Forget it, it's not important. I've been researching Hilichurlian for some time, but I'd much rather get in some actual speaking practice than constantly going over books.
:'''Ella Musk:''' I've finally stumbled across a whole hilichurl camp... I cannot let this opportunity pass me by!
:'''Ella Musk:''' So, Traveler, can you go with me into the camp and help me find a hilichurl to practice with?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, let me go drag one out for you.
::'''Ella Musk:''' Wait! No! My word, just who exactly taught you to go bashing hilichurls around like that!?
::'''Ella Musk:''' Let's compose ourselves, go over there together, and politely introduce ourselves.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it's better that you go alone.
::'''Ella Musk:''' That won't do! This is a rare opportunity. Even if you just want to slack off, I'm not letting you get off that easily!
----
;(Follow Ella Musk and talk to her again)
:'''Ella Musk:''' Thankfully there's one awake right now.
:'''Ella Musk:''' This is him, let's go over and say hi.
:'''Ella Musk:''' Be careful though, it would be rude of us to wake the others.
:'''Ella Musk:''' We don't want them thinking we're storming into their camp to attack them.
:'''Ella Musk:''' There's absolutely no way they would talk to us then.

===Approach the Hilichurl===
;(Version 1)
:'''Ella Musk:''' Olah! Muhe mimi, nye, eh... mosi aba?
:'''Hilichurl:''' Yo mimi beru si?
:'''Ella Musk:''' Buka...mita nye, guru-guru...yo mosi ka?
:'''Hilichurl:''' Ya odomu, Todo yo, buka guru-guru nye.
:'''Ella Musk:''' Mi? Dada! Valo.
:'''Hilichurl:''' Valo, ya odomu.
:'''Ella Musk:''' Hehe, look at how he's acting. He seems so happy!
:'''Ella Musk:''' Looks like this time has finally been a success, and my Hilichurlian has finally improved.

;(Talk to Ella again)
:'''Ella Musk:''' What do you think? My Hilichurlian is not bad, huh? Now that we can communicate, all that's needed to understand each other is time.
:'''Ella Musk:''' That's what I hope for anyway. My dream, is to become friends with the hilichurls.
:'''Ella Musk:''' Oh, right! Before I forget &mdash; take this. It's a present from that hilichurl.
:'''Ella Musk:''' A present from a hilichurl. Bet you never thought you'd see the day!
:'''Ella Musk:''' Well I better get going, I have so many new discoveries to note down. Perhaps we'll have a chance to meet again.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Suspicious Steak|20|x=3}})
----
;(Version 2)
:'''Ella Musk:''' Biat ye, ye pupu dada mosi! Plama ye upa dada!
:'''Hilichurl:''' Dala beru yo!? Kundala muhe, kucha?
:'''Ella Musk:''' Kundala gusha! Hahaha!
:'''Hilichurl:''' Biat ye, plata ye pupu!
:'''Hilichurl:''' Movo unta nye kucha, mi dada tiga mitono!
:'''Ella Musk:''' Oh! I think he understood me! He seems to be taking out something to show us...
:'''Ella Musk:''' Oh, oh no! It's a weapon! Traveler, help me!
:;(During battle)
:'''Ella Musk:''' Help! Help me!

;(Talk to Ella Musk after defeating the hilichurls)
:'''Ella Musk:''' Good thing you were here, otherwise I would have no idea what would have happened to me.
:'''Ella Musk:''' I don't think I said anything wrong... Maybe my pronunciation was off...?
:'''Ella Musk:''' Guess I better hit the books again and do some more research before trying again...

===If the Hilichurls are Awoken===
;(Talk to Ella after defeating the hilichurls)
:'''Ella Musk:''' I said not to startle the other hilichurls! Have you really never tried to approach a hilichurl camp quietly!?
:'''Ella Musk:''' Ugh. There's no more hilichurls left at this camp. Such a great opportunity, completely wasted. All I can do now is wait until next time.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Suspicious Steak|20|x=3}})
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
*Neither this quest nor ''[[Poetry Exchange]]'' were updated to use the hilichurls' improved interaction animations that were introduced with the ''[[Mimi Tomo]]'' event.

===Hilichurlian Translation===
Based on current understanding of [[Hilichurlian]], Ella's conversation can be partially translated:

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the hilichurl)
:'''Ella Musk:''' Olah! Muhe mimi, nye, eh... mosi aba? ''[Hello! We like/want, no, um... eat before?]''
:'''Hilichurl:''' Yo mimi beru si? ''[What do you want with us?/You talking to us?]''
:'''Ella Musk:''' Buka...mita nye, guru-guru...yo mosi ka? ''[Stomach... no meat, hungry/stomach grumbling... you eat (ka)?]''
:'''Hilichurl:''' Ya odomu, Todo yo, buka guru-guru nye. ''[Human friend(?), (todo) you, stomach no longer hungry/grumbling.]''
:'''Ella Musk:''' Mi? Dada! Valo. ''[Me? Good! Thanks/Goodbye.]''
:'''Hilichurl:''' Valo, ya odomu. ''[Thank you/goodbye, human friend(?)]''
:'''Ella Musk:''' Hehe, look at how he's acting. He seems so happy!
:'''Ella Musk:''' Looks like this time has finally been a success and my Hilichurlian has finally improved.
{{Dialogue End}}

; (Version 2)
: '''Ella Musk:''' Biat ye, ye pupu dada mosi! Plama ye upa dada! ''[Curse you, you very good grass eater!(?) (Plama) You cannot be good!(?)]''
: '''Hilichurl:''' Dala beru yo!? Kundala muhe, kucha? ''[What do you mean!? You want to fight me, you weakling?]''
: '''Ella Musk:''' Kundala gusha! Hahaha! ''[Fight vegetables! Hahaha!]''
: '''Hilichurl:''' Biat ye, plata ye pupu! ''[Hit you, with grass shield!(?)]''
: '''Hilichurl:''' Movo unta nye kucha, mi dada tiga mitono! ''[Come back after you get stronger, I have a good stone (mitono)!]''
: '''Ella Musk:''' Oh! I think he understood me! He seems to be taking out something to show us...
: '''Ella Musk:''' Oh, oh no! It's a weapon! Traveler, help me!
:


Two important things to note are: in both this quest and in [[Poetry Exchange]], Ella is still somewhat early in her studies of Hilichurlian, so we can't entirely consider her sentences to be accurate; and the original translation for this quest was made before Mimi Tomo, when our knowledge of Hilichurlian was more limited. Translations for Hilichurlian sections of dialogue will likely continue to be updated or changed as we learn more.

Considering new knowledge gained from [[Mimi Tomo]], the translation of "Yo mimi beru si?" may be incorrect and a different translation might be "You us talk (si)?" or "[Are] you talking to us?" "Odomu" and "valo" may also not mean "friend" and "thank you" respectively, but it's yet to be seen what the more accurate translation is.
