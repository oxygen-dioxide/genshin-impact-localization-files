==Profile==
Cui'er is a non-VIP attendant of the Pearl Galley. She claims to be [[Chaoxi]]'s lover, and says that they made a pact that once they reunite, Chaoxi would take Cui'er away from the Pearl Galley.

In an optional segment of the [[World Quest]] ''[[The Ocean Pearl]]'', Cui'er gives you [[Cui'er's Letter to Chaoxi|a letter]] to deliver to him. However, when you arrive, Chaoxi is talking up Sisi and pretends the letter is from a work associate, and then gives you [[Chaoxi's Reply to Cui'er|his reply]] to deliver back to her.

After completing the "The Ocean Pearl," Cui'er will stand on the deck of the Pearl Galley waiting for Chaoxi, unaware that he has been telling her tall tales to attract her attention, and has no intention of making good on his promise to take her away.

===Personality===
Cui'er is deeply in love with Chaoxi. She admires and respects his status as a sailor, greatly praising his stories. Though she is pained by the time of his arrival, she continues to wait for him due to her love for him.

In comparison to the other Pearl Galley attendants, she is one of the two willing to help the Traveler out in search of an invitation. She keeps an eye out for an invitation due to the Traveler fulfilling her favor, quietly asking staff which guests are the most approachable.

===Appearance===
Cui'er is a lady of fair height with hazel eyes. She has black straight-cut chin-length hair, with bangs that nearly cover her eyebrows.

Underneath a beige shall that reaches just below her shoulders, she wears an open traditional cardigan with loose sleeves and a mandarin collar, topped with a pearl necklace. Her cardigan is bordered by a dark purple material, and has 3-petaled flower knots. Underneath, she wears a pinkish-lavender shirt with the bottom carrying 2 layers of petal-shaped fabrications. She wears a dark dress with a single flower printed and of varying shades of purple and a vibrant beige. She wears dark purple pumps with small beige rounded bows on the front.
