==Gameplay Notes==
*The maximum refinement level is one as only one copy is given, similar to the [[Sword of Descension]].
*Players on different platforms can obtain the weapon by obtaining it on PlayStation and then activating the [[Account#Cross Save|cross-save feature]]. However, its passive effect (Strong Strike) will not activate outside of PlayStation.

==Description==
The Blacksmith who accepted the commission asked why this order had to be made this way and why it had to be named like this.

The answer was rather complicated: something about machine beasts that roamed all over the world, and something about polearms not having override codes.

The blacksmith understood quickly enough, though. So this bow was some powerful weapon used to hunt and kill these mighty machine creatures, and so it was the apex predator of that world.

But the [[Aloy|strange girl]] corrected him.

She was just going to use this to hunt wild boars next, since it appeared that in this world, using bows and arrows to hunt would actually allow one to harvest [[Raw Meat]].

*Sent via the [[mail]] to PlayStation players who log on ''Genshin Impact'' during [[Version 2.1]] or [[Version 2.2]].

==Trivia==
*[[Aloy]] is seen wielding the ascended version of this weapon in her official artwork.
*The design for this weapon appears to be based on the [[w:c:horizon:War Bow|War Bow]] in ''Horizon: Zero Dawn'', the game Aloy comes from.
* In-game, Predator was constructed to Aloy's specifications by a commissioned blacksmith on Teyvat, not brought with her from her universe.
