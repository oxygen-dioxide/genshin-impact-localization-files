{{Lang|'''Yinyuan Hall'''|zh=银原厅|zh_rm=Yínyuán-tīng|zh_tl=Silver Field Hall}} governs the salt industry, one of the [[Eight Trades]] under the jurisdiction of the [[Liyue Qixing]].<ref name="Fare">{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Sweet Salt}}</ref>

==Overview==
As the leaders of the salt industry, Yinyuan Hall worships the long-deceased God of Salt, [[Havria]]. Their ancestors were supposedly sheltered by the goddess during the [[Archon War]] in [[Sal Terrae]].<ref name="Fare"/>

Upon Havria's assassination at the hands of her own people, who believed it better to let her die with her honor intact than see her suffer by the ravages of war, the power that flowed out of her body upon her death transformed those in the vicinity into salt. Those who avoided that fate were scattered throughout [[Liyue]]. Some took refuge in [[Liyue Harbor]], which was under the protection of [[Morax]], and eventually established Yinyuan Hall.

Over thousands of years, Havria's story was passed down through Yinyuan Hall was somehow distorted into its modern version, which claims that Morax assassinated her out of envy for her power.<ref name="Fare"/> However, other descendants of Sal Terrae survivors have passed down an undistorted version of the tale, as recounted in the [[Diary of Roald the Adventurer]].
