|desc_delicious  = The crispy seaweed adds a bit of umami to the down-to-earth sweetness of the glutinous rice. For the final touch, the fresh fish within the Onigiri strikes like an ambushing band, and the satisfaction it brings to body and mind is like the clarion flourish of victory.

'''Onigiri''' {{Lang|ja=おにぎり|ja_rm=o-nigiri}} is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The recipe can be obtained from the {{Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: The Deep Divers}}, located underground near the [[Jakotsu Mine]]. The location can be found as part of {{Quest|Orobashi's Legacy: Part III}}.

Depending on the quality, Onigiri restores '''18'''/'''20'''/'''22'''% of Max HP to the selected character and regenerates '''300'''/'''390'''/'''470''' HP every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Sayu]] cooks Onigiri, there is a chance [[Dizziness-Be-Gone no Jutsu Version 2.0]] will be created instead.
