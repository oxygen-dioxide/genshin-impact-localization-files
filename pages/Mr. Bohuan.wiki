==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mr. Bohuan:''' Hmm? Do excuse me, I was quite lost in thought just then. Can I help?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Mr. Bohuan:''' I was moved by the sight of the crystal-clear water as it flows off into eternity, never to return. So I stopped here to let it enrich my mind as I recite a few lines of poetry.
::'''Mr. Bohuan:''' Look, traveler. [[Bishui River|This crystal clear river]] bifurcates at [[Dihua Marsh]], one stream flowing north to become the sweet spring from which Mondstadt's [[Dawn Winery|wineries]] draw their water, the other flowing south into the [[Sea of Clouds|sea]] and into infinity...
::'''Mr. Bohuan:''' A cry of joy wells up in me: Behold, 'tis nature's majesty!
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it...
::'''Mr. Bohuan:''' I beseech the one who thinks of me, now you must act if together we should be. Though this world shall endure for an eternity, time shall devour my present beauty...
::'''Mr. Bohuan:''' I implore the young in life to partake, to abandon caution is no mistake! Ne'er must ye thy dreams forsake; one only regrets chances they didn't take!

==Trivia==
* The term for "crystal-clear river" in Chinese is {{zh|碧水河|rm=Bìshuǐ Hé}}, which indeed translates word-for-word into "crystal-clear river," but can also be translated as [[Bishui River]].
