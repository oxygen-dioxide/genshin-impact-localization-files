'''Rocklifting Branches''' ''(unofficial name)'', also called '''Dendro Piles''',<ref name="map">Official Interactive Map: [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html Teyvat]</ref> are an exploration mechanic in [[Sumeru]].

Applying {{Dendro}} to the Rocklifting Branch will cause it to rise, and applying {{Pyro}} to the Rocklifting Branch will cause it to wither. Applying {{Electro}} to the Rocklifting Branch after applying it with {{Dendro}} will cause it to rise even higher. It will stay in this state for a few seconds before returning to the medium state.

Rocklifting Branches can have things beneath them, including [[Dendroculi]], [[Mora]] [[Investigation]] Points, and [[Enemies]], which will not be revealed until the Rocklifting Branch has been raised.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Raising a Rocklifting Branch to reveal something beneath it grants the {{Achievement|Explorer}}.
