==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ogura Yuu:''' Glory to the [[Ei|Shogun]] and her everlasting reign!
:'''Ogura Yuu:''' This is a watch tower. If you don't bring any urgent news, please find another route, traveler.
:{{DIcon}} Is something on your mind?
::'''Ogura Yuu:''' I have a sister who's taking care of our family business, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos, in Inazuma.
::'''Ogura Yuu:''' My sister and I grew up around textiles and have been making clothes since we were little. If my military duties didn't force me to be stationed here at the watch tower, I would be home helping out with the shop.
::'''Ogura Yuu:''' If the disputes between the Shogunate and the Sangonomiya can someday be resolved, I can go back home to be reunited with my family and help my sister with the shop.
::{{DIcon}} About Ogura Textiles & Kimonos...
:::'''Ogura Yuu:''' Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is a shop that my family has run proudly for many years. We only use the best quality materials and pay very close attention to the details. Many samurai lords used to come to the shop to purchase high-grade silk from Liyue.
:::'''Ogura Yuu:''' Have you ever been to Liyue? The [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]] there produces silk that is as smooth as flowing water. It's used to make top shelf clothing.
:::'''Ogura Yuu:''' I hear that it's because of a locally-grown red flower named [[Silk Flower]] that they can produce of such quality.
:::'''Ogura Yuu:''' If I get the chance, I'd love to bring my younger sister to Liyue and take a look at the Silk Flower fields...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ogura Yuu:''' See you. Be careful out there.
