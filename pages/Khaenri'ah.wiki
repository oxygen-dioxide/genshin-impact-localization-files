{{Description|Khaenri'ah was a nation without a [[god]] &mdash; not because it had a god that died or abandoned them, but because it never had a god to begin with. It was a powerful nation, built purely by humans, an unprecedented flourishing and glorious civilization &mdash; it was the pride of humankind.|[[Dainsleif]], "[[A Herald Without Adherents]]"

'''Khaenri'ah''', also known as the '''Kingdom of Khaenri'ah''' or '''Dahri''', is a region that is not part of the continent of [[Teyvat]] and is not under the purview of [[The Seven]].

Khaenri'ah is most importantly known for its role in the "[[cataclysm]]" 500 years ago. During this time, monsters created by the alchemist [[Rhinedottir]], also known as "Gold," poured out from Khaenri'ah to invade Teyvat, and Khaenri'ah was eventually destroyed by [[Celestia]] and the gods. Afterwards, all Khaenri'ahns who were not "pure-blooded" were turned into monsters, whereas all "pure-blooded" Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fortune-Mocking Pedigree|quote='''Eide:''' [...] When the cataclysm came, we pure-blood Khaenri'ahns were declared the "greater sinners." Upon us, the gods placed the curse of immortality...
But those whose ancestry belonged to the domains of other gods were punished with the curse of the wilderness as they fled, turning them into monsters.}}</ref>

Despite its destruction and the transformation of many of its people into monsters, some Khaenri'ahns are still wandering through Teyvat. [[Dainsleif]] &mdash; a denizen of Khaenri'ah and the narrator of [[Travail]] &mdash; describes it as one of "the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall," and says that its people "dream of dreaming," unlike the majority who are "content to live, and not to dream."<ref name="tcsp" />

According to [[Kaeya]], it is said that Khaenri'ah is located deep underground somewhere near [[Sumeru]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Destined Encounter|quote='''Kaeya:''' [...]And my roots... They're in Khaenri'ah, which is said to have been located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru.}}</ref> The Khaenri'ahn installation known as [[Hangeh Afrasiyab]] guards a giant, tightly sealed stone gate beneath it that most likely leads to Khaenri'ah.<ref>{{Ref/VP|Gate of Everlasting Mourning}}</ref>

[[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter ??]] takes place in this region.

==Description==

|quote   = In the perpetual meantime of a sheltered eternity, most are content to live, and not to dream.<br>But in the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall, there are those who dream of dreaming.<br>Some say a few are chosen and the rest are dregs, but I say we humans have our humanity.<br>We will defy this world with a power from beyond.

Khaenri'ah is deep underground and is mostly barren of natural life. What is currently known about Khaenri'ah largely comes from weapon and artifact descriptions, as well as books found throughout the world. According to Dainsleif, it is the "pride of humanity", as it was built purely by humans without involvement from any god, but it was later destroyed by the gods.<ref name="Dain C1A4P2">{{Ref/Quest|A Herald Without Adherents}}</ref>

The practice of the [[Art of Khemia]]<ref name="youtu.be">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/xOJfaOI87XU Collected Miscellany - "Albedo: Kreideprinz"]</ref> and the use of [[forbidden knowledge]]<ref>Interactable: [[Gavireh Lajavard#Someone's Abandoned Letter|Someone's Abandoned Letter]]<br>''...Of course, I am keenly aware that the four pillars of our kingdom have achieved the prosperity they have today precisely thanks to us spying upon secrets from beyond the skies, and thus have our mechanisms been able to throw off the shackles imposed by this world's laws...''</ref> led to the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah's ruin. Around 500 years ago, [[Irmin|King Irmin]] introduced forbidden knowledge to enhance the kingdom's technological advancement. The alchemist [[Rhinedottir]] also used it in her experiments to develop powerful creatures containing the power of the [[Abyss]], including [[Durin]], [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]], and the [[Riftwolves]]. For some reason, these creatures began wreaking havoc throughout Khaenri'ah and then spread into the rest of [[Teyvat]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|1|Ballad Selection Excerpt}}</ref>

In response,<ref>Interactable: [[Gavireh Lajavard#Ancient Journal|Ancient Journal]]</ref> the gods of Celestia and six of The Seven<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies|quote='''Greater Lord Rukkhadevata:''' At that time, The Seven were all summoned to the nation of Khaenri'ah, except for me. I had a more important task to attend to...}}</ref> launched an assault on Khaenri'ah. The skies turned red and filled with crimson cubes, (possibly the work of the [[Unknown God]]), and the landmass the kingdom was built on was torn to pieces, with lava flooding the shattered fragments of it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God|Cutscene: Promise of a People's Dream}}</ref> While the gods were victorious, at least two of The Seven &mdash; the [[Hydro]] Archon [[Egeria]] and the [[Electro]] Archon [[Makoto|Raiden Makoto]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Cleansing Light|quote='''Ei:''' The events of 500 years ago not only robbed me of my friend, Kitsune Saiguu... they also took Makoto away from me for good.}}</ref> &mdash; were killed. A third Archon, the [[Dendro]] Archon [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], died after mostly purifying the surge of forbidden knowledge that contaminated [[Irminsul]] and creating her successor, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], from the tree's purest branch.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref>

[[Mondstadt]]'s [[Knights of Favonius]], then led by Grand Master [[Arundolyn]], led an expedition into Khaenri'ah to quell the monsters. His best friend and rival, [[Rostam]], fell in battle during the cataclysm, leaving Arundolyn greatly bereaved. Other notable figures who are known for fighting against the monsters include [[Viridescent]] and the [[Signora|Crimson Witch of Flames]]. While the initial surge of monsters was eventually suppressed, [[hilichurls]] continue to spawn throughout Teyvat.

In the present, Khaenri'ah continues its struggle against the effects of the curse. Kaeya, their "last hope," was sent to Mondstadt for the sake of an "ancient plot," infiltrating the [[Ragnvindr Clan]] by being abandoned at the [[Dawn Winery]].<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaeya|4}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaeya|Vision}}</ref> The ultimate reason behind Kaeya being placed as a "sleeper" in Mondstadt by forces from Khaenri'ah is unknown.

===Abyss Order===
{{Main|Abyss Order}}
The '''Abyss Order''' originates from the destruction of Khaenri'ah by the gods;<ref name="Dain C1A4P2" /> it seeks to destroy the countries under the protection of The Seven in revenge.<ref name="Dain C1A4P3">{{Ref/Quest|Dishonorable Trial}}</ref> The people of Khaenri'ah turned into the monsters of the Abyss.<ref name="Sib C1A4P4">{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref> Thus, it is thought that [[Abyss Mages]], [[Abyss Heralds]], and [[Abyss Lectors]] were once people from Khaenri'ah, possibly its aristocracy and knights.

===Art of Khemia===
{{Main|Art of Khemia}}
{{Quote
|quote   = Khaenri'ah was an underground realm, and its natural fauna were few indeed. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life. This art of creation was known as "The Art of Khemia."
|speaker = [[Albedo]]
|source  = [[Albedo/Lore#Character Story 5|Character Story 5]]
}}
The '''Art of Khemia''' is an advanced type of [[alchemy]] developed in Khaenri'ah which allows for the creation of life itself.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Albedo|3}}</ref> Five hundred years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major contributing factor behind the cataclysm and the fall of Khaenri'ah.<ref name="youtu.be"/><ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|About Albedo}}</ref>

The only known practitioners of the Art of Khemia are [[Rhinedottir]] and [[Albedo]], her student and successful attempt to create a synthetic human.

===Automatons===
{{Main|Automatons}}
[[Ruin Machine]]s were made as weapons of war by the people of Khaenri'ah. The most common type, [[Ruin Guard]]s, were code-named "Field Tillers" by the people of Khaenri'ah. After the nation's downfall, the machines migrated across Teyvat. Though they are dangerous, they now lack any planned purpose.<ref name="Dain C1A4P2" />

==Khaenri'ahns==
The people of Khaenri'ah, who were not "pure-blooded," were changed into creatures of the Abyss as a result of the curse, which took place after Celestia destroyed their kingdom. However, "pure-blooded" Khaenri'ahns were, instead, given the curse of immortality by [[Ronova]], preventing them from aging, but still suffering from apparent [[erosion]]. The others, who hailed from the lands of the gods, were, instead, punished with the "curse of the wilderness" and transformed into various creatures; the majority of them turned into hilichurls, but others, rather, appeared to turn into Abyss Mages, Heralds, or Lectors. The royal guards of Khaenri'ah, [[The Black Serpents]], were instead eroded into either Shadowy Husks or still remained as the Black Serpents, but with a different form and still sharing the fate of suffering from erosion. However, the erosion was not complete, as some hilichurls were aware of the powers of a fountain in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] and went there to "die" peacefully, while [[Halfdan]] and his subordinates remembered their duties to protect the people of Khaenri'ah.<ref name="Sib C1A4P4" /><ref name="Requiem">{{Ref/Quest|Requiem of the Echoing Depths}}</ref>

Kaeya's family, the [[Alberich Clan]], were the Regents of Khaenri'ah after the cataclysm. It is unclear how many generations passed between Kaeya and the cataclysm; it is also unclear why Kaeya is unaffected by the curse.

Other persons associated with the state include [[Pierro]], [[Capitano]],<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Mocking Mask}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> [[Rhinedottir]], and possibly Albedo and [[Arlecchino]] by extension.

==Trivia==
[[File:Khaenri'ah "The Dream Yet to Be Dreamed".png|150px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]]]
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', unlike the [[Seven Nations]] who each have a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]], there is nothing under the title of its featured quest ''[[The Dream Yet to Be Dreamed]]''.
* [[Jean]]'s [[Jean/Voice-Overs|Voice-Overs]] mention a legend of a "heroic king of Khaenri'ah," which she offers to tell the [[Traveler]] about.
* The Eclipse Dynasty was previously translated as the {{Not a Typo|Blacksun Dynasty}}.
* In the story told in the description of [[Bloodstained Final Hour]], the [[Bloodstained Knight]] ventures into the Abyss, which he discovers was once a kingdom, those inhabitants were turned into monsters by a curse. A direct link with Khaenri'ah is not made though it could be speculated that the two are actually the same.
* It is unclear if the term Khemia is just a synonym for Alchemy, or a more advanced art.
* A hilichurl tribe called the Eclipse tribe seems to be related to Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Hilichurl Cultural Customs}}</ref>
** The Traveler seems to know something about the Eclipse symbol used by the Eclipse tribe.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About the Eclipse Tribe}}</ref>
* Although it has been stated that Khaenri'ah's downfall was caused by the [[Heavenly Principles]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God}}</ref> and that The Seven, with the exception of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], were summoned to Khaenri'ah,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> it is unknown if The Seven were directly involved in its destruction or not.
* Characters of Khaenri'ahn descent, such as Kaeya and Dainsleif, are typically depicted with pupils in the shape of [[Symbols in Teyvat#Four-Pointed Star|four-pointed stars]].
* A door with the Khaenri'ah crest can be found in the depths of [[Hangeh Afrasiyab]], though it cannot be currently interacted with in any way.

===Etymology===
* Khemia is phonetically similar to several etymological origins for the modern terms {{w|alchemy}} and {{w|chemistry}}. The origin of these terms are uncertain and multiple derivations exist.<ref>Wikipedia: {{w|Etymology of chemistry}}</ref>
** One possible derivation is from the Arabic {{Lang|mini=1|ar={{wt|كيمياء}}|ar_rm=kīmiyāʾ|ar_tl=chemistry}}, which comes from Coptic term {{Lang|mini=1|cop={{wt|ⲕⲏⲙⲉ}}|cop_rm=kēme|cop_tl=Egypt}}. The Coptic term ultimately derives from the ancient Egyptian word {{Lang|mini=1|egy={{wt|𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖}}|egy_rm=kmt}}, referring to both the country Egypt and the color black.
** Other possible derivations are from the Ancient Greek {{Lang|mini=1|grc={{wt|χημεία}}|grc_rm=khēmeía}} meaning "pouring" or "infusion," or the Ancient Greek metallurgical term {{Lang|mini=1|grc={{wt|χυμεία}}|grc_rm=khumeía}} originally meaning "pouring together," "casting together," "weld," or "alloy."
** In Arabic, "alchemy" translates to {{Lang|mini=1|ar={{wt|خيمياء}}|ar_rm=ḵīmiyāʾ}}.
* In [[Sumeru]], ''Dahri'' is an archaic name for Khaenri'ah that's commonly used in the [[Vahumana]] [[Darshan]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Afratu's Dilemma}}</ref> The Arabic-Persian word {{Lang|"dahri"|ar=دَهْرِيّ|ar_rm=dahriyy|fa=دهری|fa_rm=dahrī}}, derived from ''dahr'' (<u>Arabic-Persian:</u><!-- Manual lang format to not repeat as its the same for both --> {{Lang|mini=1|ar={{wt|دهر|دَهْر|Noun}}|ar_tl=the course of time, fate}}), is a theological term which refers to an atheist, or an adherent of the doctrine that the universe has no beginning in time. The term has been used in different ways in Middle Persian and Islamic writings, but generally, ''dahri'' deny the existence of a creator god and believe that the world exists eternally in time.<ref>Iranic Encyclopedia: [https://iranicaonline.org/articles/dahri-ar Dahrī]</ref>

===Cultural References===
* Several elements of Khaenri'ah are most likely inspired by the {{w|Germanic mythology|Germanic legends}}, particularly the {{w|Nibelungenlied|Nibelungen song}}.
** Most characters related to Khaenri'ah are named after Germanic/Norse myth and literature:
*** [[Dainsleif]] &mdash; the name of a {{w|Dáinsleif|legendary sword}}.
*** Alberich ([[Kaeya]]'s surname) &mdash; the name of a {{w|Alberich|dwarven king}}, also appearing in Richard Wagner's ''{{w|Der Ring des Nibelungen}}'' opera.
*** [[Durin]] and [[Dvalin]] &mdash; the names of {{w|Durinn|two dwarven smiths}}.
*** [[Surtalogi]] &mdash; the name of the bright sword or flame wielded by the Fire Jotunn {{w|Surtr}} from Norse mythology.
*** [[Hroptatyr]] &mdash; one of the {{w|List of names of Odin|names of Odin}}, meaning "sage."
*** [[Rhinedottir]] &mdash; {{w|Rhinemaidens|characters}} from ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' based on Germanic mythology.
*** [[Rerir]] &mdash; a {{w|Rerir|powerful ruler}} in Germanic mythology that murders his father and is the ancestor of the Völsung clan.
*** [[Vedrfolnir]] &mdash; a {{w|Veðrfölnir and eagle|hawk}} in Norse mythology that sits between the eyes of an unnamed eagle perched atop the world tree Yggdrasil.
*** The Viking Age Norse equivalent for [[Irmin]] &mdash; Jörmunr, which is used in the {{w|Poetic Edda}} as an epithet for the Norse god {{w|Odin}}.
*** [[Thrain]] &mdash; a barrow-wight from the Norse legend {{w|Hrómundar saga Gripssonar}}.
** The battle between gods and god-like powers caused a catastrophe onto the world, and [[Abyss Heralds]] still preach the burning and the end of the world. The concept resembles the event in Norse mythology called {{Lang|"Fate of the Gods"|non=''{{w|Ragnarök}}''}} or {{Lang|"Twilight of the Gods"|de=''Götterdämmerung''}} in the Nibelungen song. Dainsleif's title, "Twilight Sword," shares a similar wording.
* Khaenri'ah's motto, "The land is [...] to be fought for with steel and blood,"<ref name="Dain C1A4P2" />  is likely to be a reference to {{Lang|"with iron and blood"|de=''durch Eisen und Blut''}}, a famous phrase used during the {{w|Blood and Iron (speech)|Blood and Iron Speech}} made by the Prussian minister president {{w|Otto von Bismarck}} in 1862.
** While the English version uses the wording "with steel and blood," the Chinese one uses {{Lang|"with iron and blood"|zh=用铁和血}} that exactly matches the wording of the historical speech.
