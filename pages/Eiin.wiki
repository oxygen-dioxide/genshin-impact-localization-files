{{Lang|'''Eiin'''|ja=永胤|ja_rm=Eiin}} was the previous Soushu (clan head) of the [[Iwakura Clan]] before [[Iwakura Mitsunari]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Iwakura Mitsunari}}</ref>
<!--
As a bearer of the {{Lang|"In"|ja=胤|ja_rm=-in, -tane}} title,<ref group="Note">Nagatane was his swordsman title as per the Iwakura Clan tradition explained in Amenoma Kageuchi's description, and his real name is unknown. This is not made obvious in the English version, as {{Lang|Nagatane|ja=永胤}} uses the kanji's {{w|kun'yomi}} reading whereas {{Lang|"Douin"|ja=道胤}} ([[Iwakura Doukei]]'s title) and {{Lang|"Kouin"|ja=光胤}} ([[Iwakura Kouzou]]'s title) use their {{w|Go-on}} (on'yomi) reading.</ref> he was also the previous wielder of "Hakuen Bankou Amenoma," the original version of [[Amenoma Kageuchi]] passed down to every Iwakura Clan head.-->

==Story==
At some point, Eiin studied [[Shinryuu]]. He once tried to challenge a human-shaped Electro Crystalfly and was defeated in ten seconds.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Phantom Flow: Phantasmal Blade}}</ref>

During Eiin's tenure as Soushu, [[Okazaki Toraemon]] and [[Okazaki Kunihiko]] were adopted by an Iwakura Art practitioner. Kouzou, [[Yanagiha Arashi]], and [[Shimada Shichirouji]] were also members of the clan by this point. At some point, Eiin presumably died and Kouzou took up the position of Soushu.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Okazaki Toraemon}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Yanagiha Arashi}}</ref>
