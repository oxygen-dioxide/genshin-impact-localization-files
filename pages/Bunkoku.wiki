'''Bunkoku''', possibly also known as '''Tyeseus''', was a historical figure who lived in [[Enkanomiya]] during the age of the [[Sunchildren]].

==Profile==
According to [[Yabe]], Bunkoku is recorded as a traitor to Byakuyakoku, and few other details about him remain in the surviving historical records kept by [[Watatsumi Island]]. One record states that he was the corrupt second Prime Minister of Byakuyakoku who amassed a large personal fortune by overtaxing the populace. [[Koyanagi]], an ancient Enkanomiyan treasure hunter, also refers to Bunkoku as a "despicable, craven traitor."<ref name="enigma">{{Ref/Quest|The Bunkoku Enigma}}</ref>

Bunkoku hid his treasure in a secret chamber somewhere underneath the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], concealed by [[Sunfire Phantasm]]s and guarded by vengeful spirits and "tainted beings from the Ley Lines." His treasure has since become known as the first of the four great puzzles of Enkanomiya and it is still hidden to the current day.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref> In fact, it was already discovered long ago by Koyanagi and his friend, prior to the abandonment of Enkanomiya. However, Koyanagi ended up murdering his friend and resetting the puzzle, either possessed by one of the guardian spirits or struck by madness, and believing the treasure would become a "mystery for the ages" if left untouched.<ref name="enigma" />

* Yabe offers "Tyeseus" as a possibility for Bunkoku's Enkanomiyan name. Tyeseus is likely derived from the mythical Greek hero {{w|Theseus}}.
