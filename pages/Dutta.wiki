===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After smashing the Pulverite in Dutta's field and defeating the Avatar of Lava)
:'''Dutta:''' My goodness, surely not... A kind soul showing up, completely out of the blue?
:'''Dutta:''' I was planning to have a [[Tatankasaurus]] drop by to help smash up and clear aside the stones in this barren field. If any monsters happened to pop out of the woodwork, it could help deal with them for me as well.
:'''Dutta:''' I haven't even gotten started, yet someone's already taken care of it all for me.
:'''Dutta:''' Ah... I've been fertilizing the fruit trees outside my doorstep every morning for as long as I can remember. This must be the gods' way of rewarding me!
:'''Dutta:''' Kind soul, emissary of the gods! I, Dutta, thank you for your generosity.
:'''Dutta:''' I don't have anything special to give you, but here's some Mora and a few other useless bits and bobs. Please, accept them.

===Dialogue Set #2===
;(Talk to Dutta after the initial encounter)
:'''Dutta:''' Kind soul, emissary of the gods, thank you for your help! Without you, I would have had to find a Tatankasaurus to help solve my quandary.
:'''Dutta:''' Ah, whenever I came across rocks or monsters in the fallow fields before, I always had to rely on Tatankasaurs for help. This time, fortune has blessed me with you.
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong with your fields?
::'''Dutta:''' It's mostly just the rocks. Once those have been cleared out, everything else is child's play. I've been farming for decades, so I'm pretty good at it by now.
::'''Dutta:''' Don't be put off by the state it's in at the moment. A little hard work will turn this into the most pristine field you've ever seen.
::'''Dutta:''' How about I let you in on a little farmer's secret? This isn't something I usually tell people.
::'''Dutta:''' Every time I'm finished... answering nature's call, I collect all the "fertilizer" and spread it on my fields...
::'''Dutta:''' Hey, there's no need to go pulling faces. This is all part of the great circle of life!
:{{DIcon}} Tatankasaurs?
::'''Dutta:''' Of course! You won't find a single farm in the Collective of Plenty that doesn't raise Tatankasaurs.
::'''Dutta:''' Chasing away forest boars and birds that come to steal crops, tilling the soil, and sowing seeds, Tatankasaurs can do it all!
::'''Dutta:''' And baby Tatankasaurs are very friendly and easy to raise. Just stick them in a field and they'll grow all by themselves...
::{{DIcon}} They really grow just like that?
::'''Dutta:''' What I mean is, if you bring them with you when you're working, and leave them in the fields to play...
::'''Dutta:''' In a few years and a few harvests, you'll suddenly realize they've grown into adults.
::'''Dutta:''' Just like my son, [[Paqarin]]. That's exactly how he was raised.
::'''Dutta:''' He's been watching me work since he was tiny. Now he's a grown and capable man.
::'''Dutta:''' Time truly is merciless... No, no, I can't start thinking like that.
::'''Dutta:''' I'm getting on a bit, but my legs work fine and I've still got all my teeth. I can still work for a good while yet!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Dutta:''' Goodbye, kind soul.
