'''DMG Reduction''' is an attribute that reduces the [[DMG Bonus]] of incoming attacks. DMG Reduction can be provided by certain talents and constellations.

Multiple DMG Reduction abilities stack additively. If DMG Reduction exceeds <math>1 + \text{DMG Bonus of Incoming Attack}\%</math>, incoming damage will be completely nullified, but [[Poise Damage]] and [[stagger]] effects will still apply.<ref group="Note">For example, this is achievable by stacking Beidou, Jean, and Xingqiu's abilities.</ref>

It is also possible for enemies to obtain negative DMG Reduction via the [[Thunder Dwelling]] debuff or certain character abilities, in which case DMG Bonus will be added to incoming attacks.
