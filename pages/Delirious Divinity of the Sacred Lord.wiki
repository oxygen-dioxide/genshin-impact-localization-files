|description = The [[Sacred Lord]] of the [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|ineffable city]] often murmured non-human languages in his dreams, and when he beheld himself in the mirror, he saw how the single pupil that was visible through his mask was gradually becoming vertical. This only served to further fuel his growing hatred for the dragons.<br>It is said that when the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|scarlet-eyed youth]] burned down that city above a city, submerged in shadow as it was, he witnessed a half-human figure before the [[Cradle of Fleeting Dreams|royal hall]] who had been driven mad. As if tearing off its very face, it ripped away at its indelible divine visage, revealing gaping holes that were fearsomely draconic.<br>Consumed by the golden flames it spewed, the disfigured form of that deranged soul fell from a great height into the pitch-black mire below. Forsaken by all, thus was the tragic end that this delusional outcast is said to have met.
