|description    = A small settlement that makes an effort to recapture the scenery in Merusea Village, with unique and rather eye-catching buildings.
The Melusines dwell within Elynas, beneath the waves, and few normal people visit their village, though those who do all sing its praises upon their return. Some artists have tried to draw the place based on the descriptions and information gained from interviewing Melusines in the Court of Fontaine. However, there was always a "color difference" between their work and the real colors of the village that was hard to ignore. It was only after Kamera-taken images of Merusea Village became widespread that the problem was more or less solved...
