{{Quest Description|You have temporarily lost [[Nahida]]'s help, but according to the message she left behind, you will meet someone in the desert who can help you get out of the woods. To foil the nefarious plot between the Akademiya and the Fatui, you set off on another journey.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the marked area in Caravan Ribat)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've finally made it to Caravan Ribat. It's pretty lively here!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So just past this wall is the desert, huh...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh wow, Paimon remembers hearing people call this the [[Wall of Samiel]]. It's made to block sandstorms from the outside... If it's this tall, it's gotta be the divine work of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], right?
:{{DIcon}} It is indeed quite impressive...
:{{DIcon}} Truly awe-inspiring.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 1 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...Enough gawking. Come on, follow me.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh...?
:{{DIcon}} Alhaitham!?
:{{DIcon}} (Where did he come from...?)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 1 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Over here.

;(Follow Alhaitham)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham went that way &mdash; let's hurry up and follow him. Wonder what he's up to...

;(Approach Alhaitham)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 membera 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq103 2 membera 01b.ogg}} '''Eremite Mercenary:''' What the? Where did {{MC|m=he|f=she}} go!?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 membera 02.ogg}} '''Eremite Mercenary:''' Ugh, how did we lose 'em? They were just here a second ago...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' More Eremite mercenaries? Who're they working for this time... Anyway, Traveler, it seems like we were being followed again!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You were too careless. You should have noticed those hopeless amateurs trailing you a long time ago.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Alhaitham.
:{{DIcon}} We couldn't have shaken them without you.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There's no need to thank me. I've never cared to keep track of personal favors.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' All I did was correct a mistake I happened to come across. It's a habit I developed at the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You really gave Paimon a scare, Alhaitham! We never thought we'd run into you here.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Last time we met at [[Port Ormos]], didn't you say you were going back to the Akademiya? Wait... don't tell Paimon that you're here to take us back on their orders!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Oh, so you've already landed yourselves on the Akademiya's hit list? Haha, I can't say that I didn't expect it.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' However, had I wished to turn you over to the Akademiya, don't you think you'd already be the Eremites' honored guests by now?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right... You do have a point.
:{{DIcon}} Did you participate in the sages' big project?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I have no interest in running errands for that project. As a scholar, I've always belonged to the camp that promotes researcher autonomy.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' And these days, you are more fascinating than anything the sages can offer.
:{{DIcon}} So, you were actually looking for me?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Hmm, not quite. To tell you the truth... I'm still investigating the [[Divine Knowledge Capsule]]. Unfortunately, I've run into some difficulties.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Everyone says the capsule originated in the desert and was eventually moved to Port Ormos. If I am to get to the bottom of this, I must understand how the capsule first came to be.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Which brings me back to you, and why you're so interesting.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar used the Divine Knowledge Capsule right in front of you, and upon seeing him, your expression became perplexed, and you were lost in thought for quite some time.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' To have that kind of reaction, I think you must have realized something. Are you interested at all in sharing what you've been hiding from me?
:'''(Traveler):''' (It must be because I was so shocked to hear those words again... "world... forget me...")
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham, you really have a ridiculous eye for detail! What kind of person even notices and remembers stuff like that...
:{{DIcon}} The situation is a little complicated.
:{{DIcon}} I can't share what I know just yet.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' So that's your answer... Well, I do work for the Akademiya after all. So considering that, it is indeed wise to keep your cards close to your chest.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 14.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' But that does prove you do have some undisclosed information about the Divine Knowledge Capsule. Am I right?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 15.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' No matter. Rather than simply learning the answers from you, I'd still prefer to investigate on my own. Speaking of, you two are also headed to the desert?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right, we have the same plan as you. But we don't really have any concrete goals at the moment...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 alhaitham 16.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Then I'd suggest starting with Aaru Village. It's the largest settlement in the desert, so it'll probably have more resources and intel than anywhere else. Well? Would you like to head there together?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds good.
:{{DIcon}} Let's head there together then.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's always better to travel with someone you know. Let's go!
----
;(Approach the entrance to Aaru Village)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Before us lies Aaru Village, the safe haven of the desert folk.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this landscape is really something else. What a cool place! Let's go check it out!

;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
{{Cutscene Description|Just as you march forward with your companions in tow, someone comes at you, striking with a spear, and soon gets himself into a fight with Alhaitham. After a few rounds, Alhaitham recognizes the attacker — Cyno, General Mahamatra of the Akademiya.}}
:;(The Traveler, Paimon, and Alhaitham walk towards Aaru Village when they are suddenly attacked)
::'''[[Cyno|???]]:''' Hmph!
:;(Alhaitham and the attacker start to fight)
::'''Alhaitham:''' ...Cyno
::'''Cyno:''' Tsk...
:;(Cinematic ends)

:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Unless my memory fails me, we have barely spoken two words to each other before now at the Akademiya. Would you care to enlighten me as to when and how I invited the General Mahamatra's wrath?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alhaitham, do not think you can escape my judgment just because you managed to escape my attack.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' "Judgment"? So, that's how you'd characterize your actions here, is it? Or would "elimination" perhaps be a more accurate description?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Had I used my full strength, not even this traveler would have been able to stop me.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Though styled like an assassination, I sought only to ensure that my target would be unable to flee or resist. Standard practice for the matra, as well you know.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Seemed to me more like your own personal touch.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, wh&mdash;who is that, Alhaitham? Did you call him "General Mahamatra"?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Yes... General Mahamatra Cyno, head of all the matra at the Akademiya. He's a formidable hunter, and the ultimate nightmare for any who have committed academic crimes.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You seem to have placed a lot of trust in Alhaitham, to the point of blocking an attack for him.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If I were you, I'd never choose to side with him. I wouldn't believe a single word that comes out of his mouth.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I have been pursuing this scribe for a long time. I urge you, stand back and do not seek to defend him any longer. Otherwise... there will be consequences.
:{{DIcon}} I don't trust him as much as you seem to think.
:{{DIcon}} But that doesn't mean I'm going to stand by and do nothing.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Has Alhaitham done something wrong? Paimon doesn't think he's as bad as you've made him out to be.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I won't waste my breath explaining things. Alhaitham, I saw it during our fight...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Take it out. The Divine Knowledge Capsule you're hiding on your person. Unless you want me to retrieve it for myself?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Very perceptive of you... Nothing escapes a matra's senses.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, the Divine Knowledge Capsule!? Didn't it fall into the matra's hands in Port Ormos?
:{{DIcon}} So you did lie to us.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' No wonder you speak with such confidence, Cyno. But I must admit, I am very curious... What does this capsule mean to you?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' And why, as General Mahamatra of the Akademiya, are you all alone in the desert?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' As far as I'm aware, the other matra have been speculating about your disappearance.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Have you been given a mission that's... let's say, morally dubious?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' If I was the real target of your mission, what was stopping you from simply using your authority and resources to judge me within the walls of the Akademiya?
:{{DIcon}} Is it a mission from the sages?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I should have known you'd be difficult to deal with.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You two... Ugh, what should we do, (Traveler)? Paimon feels like we can't trust either of them...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Ahem... Well look at you two, acting all tough and self-righteous over there.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, [[Dehya]]!?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great, (Traveler), finally someone that we can trust!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You gotta help us out here! Otherwise, these two are gonna start fighting again...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Yeah, sure looks that way... Two giants from the Akademiya, duking it out once and for all. Not something you get to see every day, that's for sure.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Listen, I know you academic types love to fill up your big brains with self-righteous morality, and lord your empty rules and virtues over each other...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' But how dare you bring your petty disputes into the safe haven of Aaru Village?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' It seems like someone's gonna have to beat some sense into your thick skulls until you finally learn to respect these grounds!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Neither of them can afford to be distracted by Dehya...
:{{DIcon}} They're still looking for an opportunity to attack...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hey! Did either of you hear a word I just said!?
:'''Wind:''' Whoosh...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! What's going on!? The wind's so strong &mdash; is this a sandstorm!? Paimon's gonna get blown away!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Tch... Another sandstorm? What's up with these recently?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 candace 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey! All of you, over here, quickly! We have to take cover!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Someone's calling for us, (Traveler)! This wind is too strong. Let's get over there!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' That sounded like [[Candace]]...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...C'mon, you two! Geez, are all you Akademiya folks such hard work? Move it!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 alhaitham 14.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Alright, stop yelling.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 3 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Hmph.
----
;(A scene transition occurs)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, this is pretty awkward...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Hey, wanna play sardines with three people who wanna tear each other limb from limb?" "Sure, why not, sounds fun!"...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... The air's so thick and heavy, Paimon can hardly keep floating anymore...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 01.ogg}} '''???:''' My sincere apologies, everyone. This is the home of our village chief. I will have to ask you to make do with this small room until the sandstorm dies down.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Please let me introduce myself. I am Candace, protector of Aaru Village.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, our savior has come at last!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice to meet you, Candace! The name's Paimon! Thank you so much for helping us!
:{{DIcon}} You have my gratitude.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Hehe, there's no need to thank me. It's only right to help each other when the weather gets rough.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... She's so gentle and caring, like a nice older sister! ...Unlike those guys over there.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 04.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Alright, now that we're all better acquainted, we should return to the topic at hand.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 05.ogg}} '''Candace:''' As a guardian charged with the responsibility to protect my fellow villagers from harm, I was observing your conflict from afar, even before the sandstorm started.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 06.ogg}} '''Candace:''' And now that you have set foot within Aaru Village itself, it is all the more my responsibility to make absolutely sure that you pose no threat whatsoever to us.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 07.ogg}} '''Candace:''' So please, have an honest and sincere conversation with one another, and put your hostile feelings to rest.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 08.ogg}} '''Candace:''' If anyone dares to start anything again while they are under this roof... I will not hesitate to send them out for some quality time with the creatures of the sandstorm.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh... On second thought, Paimon may have misjudged Candace's character.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hmph...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 09.ogg}} '''Candace:''' And that goes for you too, Miss Dehya.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 10.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Do I make myself clear?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *sigh*... Alright, we got it, Candace.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 11.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Hehe, that's what I like to hear. So, which of you will begin?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I was supposed to be a mediator, but uh... I might've gotten a little too involved just now. Anyway, one of those two should probably start talking.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that was you trying to be a mediator?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I have nothing to hide, so there is no shame in explaining myself.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' While Alhaitham wasn't wrong about the other matra not knowing my whereabouts, it's not because I've been assigned a morally dubious mission.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Rather... I've chosen to exile myself.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Exile yourself?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A little while ago, I discovered that there was data missing in the Akademiya's project planning and development files. What little they did report clearly did not match the project's actual progress.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' As General Mahamatra, I had the responsibility and authority to request an audit. However, to my surprise, the person responsible for the erroneous data was none other than Grand Sage [[Azar]] himself.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I tried to investigate the issue myself before submitting a formal audit request, but I soon found that all leads and potential pieces of incriminating evidence were carefully concealed from me.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I began to realize that... they were cautious of me from the very beginning.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Unsurprisingly, the Grand Sage rejected my audit request as soon as the submission reached his desk. He even said to me:
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' "The power of the General Mahamatra is granted by the sages. You have no right to judge us."
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' So they really are up to no good.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I realized then that to the Grand Sage, the matra are nothing more than tools for the sages to assert and maintain their control over knowledge.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The vows that we took, the principles that we strive to uphold... They are meaningless to the Akademiya of today.
:{{DIcon}} So you then decided to exile yourself?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I believed it would be wise to flee the Akademiya before the sages had a chance to take action against me. This way, they can no longer see nor predict my actions.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I will never give up on this investigation... There's no need for someone else to give me power or authority. Once I find the truth, I will administer judgment by my own name.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cyno seems to have the same goal as us... We're all investigating the sages!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Plus, now that he's no longer the General Mahamatra, he somehow feels a lot less scary!
:{{DIcon}} (It's still too early to trust him completely...)
:{{DIcon}} (What if that whole story was just made up?)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Cyno, if that's your story, then why did you see Alhaitham as a target?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' When I was investigating the matter in the Akademiya, I overheard a conversation between Alhaitham and a sage.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The sages asked you to investigate a {{MC|m=blond|f=blonde}}-haired Traveler. Do you dispute this, Alhaitham?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 18.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Like many parts of the project, this assignment was undocumented. Now, throw in your suspicious behavior with the Divine Knowledge Capsule, and I think we deserve an explanation.
:{{DIcon}} From the very beginning, Alhaitham was...
:{{DIcon}} The sages were watching me from the very beginning...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Yes, I was indeed tasked with investigating the Traveler.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' After all, the promised reward was so great that hardly any scholar could have refused. The sage told me, "Once you've completed this assignment, I can give you a glimpse of divine knowledge."
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A most enticing offer.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Unfortunately, those academics don't know me at all.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Their words contained one key piece of information, namely that "Divine Knowledge" indeed exists. That gave me all I needed to know.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' From my perspective, the sages are far from trustworthy. Think about it: Isn't it a little strange that they're so willing to share Divine Knowledge with anyone, even as a reward?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' So, I began my own investigation following the lead of the Divine Knowledge Capsule. In the end, I realized my wisdom in committing to this rather than collaborating with the sages.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Had I been less guarded, I probably would have ended up like that Ayn Al-Ahmar mercenary, incapable of remaining sane for long enough to hold a conversation.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 20.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You mean that the sages originally planned to dispose of you using one of those capsules that drive people insane?
:{{DIcon}} What about your encounter with me?
:{{DIcon}} Did you join forces with me just so you could investigate me?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I'd already given up on the assignment by then. I only told the Akademiya I was waiting in Port Ormos for you to appear so that they wouldn't suspect anything.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' So it came as quite a surprise when I encountered my erstwhile target while investigating the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 21.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Criminals do love to talk about "coincidences."
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Even though I ran into (Traveler) by chance, I had no intention of providing assistance to the Akademiya. Also, you should remember...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 13.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You were the ones who decided to follow me and strike up a conversation after I left that tavern.
:{{DIcon}} Now that you mention it, things did go like that...
:{{DIcon}} Is that enough to prove his innocence...?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true... Alhaitham helped us out at Caravan Ribat as well. Maybe he's telling the truth?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 14.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I'm willing to apologize, if that's worth anything to you.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 15.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I took the Divine Knowledge Capsule behind your back because I judged its existence to be a significant risk. I felt that it would be best for no one to interact with it before it had been properly studied.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 16.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' After all, curiosity often proves to be the most dangerous thing in this land.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 22.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You should be well aware, Scribe Alhaitham, that curiosity can also lead you to danger and suspicion.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 23.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Answer me this: Did the sages share any information about their project with you?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 17.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Have I not made myself clear? You and I are both distrusted by the Akademiya. Do you really think they would tell me anything?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 cyno 24.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Fine. Although you haven't completely proven your innocence, I won't regard you as an enemy for now.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 alhaitham 18.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' As you wish.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 12.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Mm&mdash;hmm, good. I'm glad to see you two clearing up your misunderstandings.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 13.ogg}} '''Candace:''' And now you, Dehya. I believe it's your turn.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' ...Oh, sorry. Whatever the boys were talking about must have been so boring that I spaced out.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 06b.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Ahem... My situation is pretty straightforward. My employer, [[Dunyarzad]] of the [[Homayani Family|Homayani family]], is friends with the Traveler and is currently recovering from [[Eleazar|her illness]] at home.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I had nothing going on, so I decided to return to Aaru Village for a visit. I was actually looking forward to a pretty exciting time getting back together with everyone here...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' But then I saw these two random guys in the middle of a pointless argument. It ticked me off, and things went downhill from there...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 14.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Is that all? Well, I will admit that definitely sounds like your style. In that case, welcome back, Dehya!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' That's more like it! I missed you all so much, Candace...
:'''???:''' *growl*
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! What was that sound?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 15.ogg}} '''Candace:''' No need to worry. Now that you're no longer at each other's throats, please make yourselves at home. I'll take a quick trip outside to clear out some of those creatures in the sandstorm.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C&mdash;Creatures in the sandstorm...? Uh, are you sure you don't want some backup?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 candace 16.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Fighting in a sandstorm is not for the fainthearted. Anyone without extensive training in these conditions is at a disadvantage. You needn't worry.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 10.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Yeah, just leave them to Candace. Don't worry, she's as tough as they come.

:'''After a while, the winds outside begin to calm.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The winds died down... That means the sandstorm's over, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Candace still isn't back yet, though. Is she alright? Maybe we should go out and check on her.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 4 dehya 11.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' When you put it that way, even I'm starting to feel a little worried... Alright, let's go. We've been here long enough, and the boys are as chatty as the floor.
----
;(Leave the house and approach Candace)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... Candace, you're still fighting? You've been out here dealing with these creatures the entire time?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 5 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Yes, they just keep coming in waves... I've lost count of how many I've defeated. Before I realized it, even the sandstorm had stopped...
:{{DIcon}} Not only is she really strong...
:{{DIcon}} Her stamina is also something else...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eek, here comes another wave!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 5 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Leave this round to us! I got interrupted earlier, but now I have something to take my anger out on!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 5 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Hehe, it's been quite a while since I've seen the Flame-Mane in action. I'll leave these to you then.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 5 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I'll be sure to put on a good show! (Traveler), let's go!

;(After defeating the first wave of Rifthounds)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, here comes another wave... When are they ever gonna let up!?

;(After defeating the second wave of Rifthounds)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The creatures stopped appearing. Was that the last of them?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' What we fought just now was probably the aftermath of the sandstorm, so we should be safe for the time being.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Well fought, everyone. No injuries, I hope?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Who are you?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, my apologies, I haven't had a chance to greet you yet. I had my hands full taking care of the village's elderly and children.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 03.ogg}} '''Uncle Anpu:''' I am the chief of Aaru Village. Everyone usually calls me Uncle Anpu.
:{{DIcon}} It's a pleasure to meet you.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for all the trouble.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Sir, I am also originally from the desert, but I have not been back for some time now. May I ask if such sandstorms are common?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 04.ogg}} '''Uncle Anpu:''' I can't say they've always been common, but recently, the storms have become increasingly severe and frequent.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 05.ogg}} '''Uncle Anpu:''' Besides sandstorms, we also occasionally get earthquakes... According to an investigator who stayed in the village a while ago, these unusual natural phenomena are related to the withering of [[Irminsul]].
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, another effect of Irminsul's withering...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... Irminsul's withering causes [[Withering Zones]] in the forest, and sandstorms and earthquakes here in the desert?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Everything in the natural world is inextricably connected to Irminsul. These "regional symptoms" can indeed be a reflection of Irminsul's present state.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' *sigh* Everyone in Aaru Village needs to take good care of themselves.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Uh, speaking of which, why haven't I seen a single Village Keeper since I got here?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Village Keeper? Who are they? Village guards like Candace?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Does your curiosity know no bounds... "Village Keeper" is how Aaru Village refers to mad scholars exiled here by the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Most of them are scholars who lost their sanity after a period of training in the Avidya Forest.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The Akademiya believes that their crazed mutterings may have a negative effect on the psyches of other scholars, so they're forcibly exiled to the desert... Though if you ask me, it's all a boatload of nonsense.
:{{DIcon}} Tighnari also brought this up before...
:{{DIcon}} Haypasia was also nearly exiled to the desert.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 06.ogg}} '''Uncle Anpu:''' Alas, that's exactly what we've been trying to investigate. One by one, the Village Keepers have been mysteriously disappearing without a trace...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 07.ogg}} '''Uncle Anpu:''' But no one in the village has ever seen them leave... If you're planning to stay around the village for the next few days, I'd appreciate it if you could keep an eye out for them.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...I've had encounters with those people in the past. I'll see what I can do to help.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The matra are the ones responsible for their exile. Now that you're no longer with them, are you trying to alleviate your guilt and atone for your past sins? I'm fascinated by how you think.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Mock me if you will. But if you are guilty, I will eliminate you, regardless of my position or identity.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 uncleanpu 08.ogg}} '''Uncle Anpu:''' Oh, you're the former General Mahamatra? You must be an expert in these kinds of investigations. Thank you for your help.
:{{DIcon}} I'll help, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it because you're reminded of Haypasia, (Traveler)? These poor scholars, first they lose their sanity, now this... We need to help get them back home, safe and sound.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, uh... Is it really a good idea to tag along with Cyno? You seem like you really don't trust him.
:{{DIcon}} That's why this is a great opportunity to watch him.
:{{DIcon}} It'll be fine. Dehya and the others are here, too.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'll be grateful for the assistance. No doubt you will do a better job than some of my former subordinates.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 6 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Let's start by finding a spot to share what we know so far.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Although I've sent myself into exile, I'm still doing essentially the same things as before...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Do you still have any questions for me before we start our investigation?
:{{DIcon}} Why do they refer to the mad scholars as Village Keepers?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' One of my former subordinates told me that this title has its origins in a strange incident.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The Akademiya has long exiled mad scholars to Aaru Village. A mysterious phenomenon exists here...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' When mad scholars first arrive, they are as incoherent and deranged as before. But after spending some time here, they invariably begin to calm down.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Initially, the people of Aaru Village greatly resented having to take in the mad scholars. But a strange incident one night changed that...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Aaru Village was struck by the strongest earthquake in living memory. Seeing buildings on the verge of collapse all around him, the then chief of the village was preparing to take everyone to safety...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Suddenly, he noticed a mad scholar crouching in a corner, caressing the ground with his hands. A soft, green light radiated from him, like a divine glow against the backdrop of night.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Despite the powerful tremors that ripped through the ground that night, all the houses remained upright, almost as if they had grown roots reaching deep into the ground. In the end, not a single building collapsed, and no one was hurt.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' After that, the people of Aaru Village treated the mad scholars with greater kindness, and began to refer to them as the Village Keepers.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A soft, green light... A mad scholar protecting Aaru Village... Hmm, what do you make of it, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} It must have been Nahida's power.
:{{DIcon}} Only she could be capable of that...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so, too! Actually, Cyno, do you know if any of the mad scholars continued to wear their Akasha Terminals at Aaru Village?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' In theory, they would continue wearing them so the Akademiya could still monitor their activities. With that said, the main Akasha system would no longer have any interaction with them.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, no wonder! Everything makes sense, then! Add in the fact that they calmed down... It was probably Nahida who calmed them...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...If you are able to draw a conclusion from this one story alone, then it appears you possess much more information than I do.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' So, what do you make of the story?
:{{DIcon}} That mad scholar's power likely came from Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{DIcon}} Lesser Lord Kusanali was actually the one who protected the village.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Really? Lesser Lord Kusanali...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What, you don't believe us? Lesser Lord Kusanali was definitely using the Akasha to give her power to the mad scholars...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No, it's not so much that I don't believe you, I'm just struck by your reasoning...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Lesser Lord Kusanali, the current Dendro Archon... Is she really active in Sumeru?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 18.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The Akademiya has always placed far greater importance on the late Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. They've more or less ignored Lesser Lord Kusanali, and I've never had any reason to doubt their views.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' In addition, I've never heard any stories about Lesser Lord Kusanali and her deeds... To me, she might as well have been a god that never existed.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No way, Nahida definitely exists! She's a... How should Paimon put it... She's a good archon who's kind and wise! ...Even if she says weird stuff sometimes!
:{{DIcon}} She also saved me once not long ago.
:{{DIcon}} We saved Sumeru City together in the not-so distant past.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 20.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I've spent many years interrogating criminals, so I can easily tell when someone is lying.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good! Then you should know that we're telling the truth!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 21.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That look in your eyes... I've never seen that from a liar. You two really must have met Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 22.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...How can this be...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 23.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' To think, our archon has been among us this entire time...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, now it's our turn to put our skills to good use for this investigation!
:{{DIcon}} You betcha!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But easier said than done, especially since we don't have any leads... Hmm... Maybe we can start by knocking on some doors?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 isak 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Excuse me, are you here to help me find my grandpa?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Who are you?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 24.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' By the sounds of it... a resident of this village.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 isak 02.ogg}} '''Isak:''' M&mdash;My name is Isak... You'll help me find my grandpa, right?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 25.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Is your grandpa a mad scholar?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 isak 03.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Hey, don't say that! Grandpa is just Grandpa. Why do you have to call him that... It's not like he's a bad person or anything.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 26.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 27.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The person you're referring to is not a local, yet you are. Why do you call him "Grandpa"?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 isak 04.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Grandpa is just Grandpa! He's my family.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 isak 05.ogg}} '''Isak:''' I heard everything you said to the village chief. Please, you gotta take me with you! I wanna find my grandpa, I swear I'll help... I won't be a nuisance!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 28.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Ah, so you're the one who was eavesdropping on us around the village chief's house.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 29.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I was planning to go out and take care of whoever it was, but I had a vague feeling that they didn't harbor any ill intent...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Alhaitham wasn't kidding about matra having sharp senses... Cyno, he's just a kid! All he wants is to find his grandpa. Let's find a way to help him!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 isak 06.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Sorry... I was only listening in because I wanted to know where Grandpa went, honest! If you don't believe me, you can ask Miss Candace.
:{{DIcon}} Please help him, Cyno.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 7 cyno 30.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Alright. But first, let's confirm the facts with Candace.
----
;(Enter the village chief's house)
:'''As you approach the village chief's house, Cyno asks Isak to wait nearby.'''

:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cyno is super vigilant... Is this what all the matra are like?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Ah, you're back already.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We just wanted to confirm something with you. Do you know a boy by the name of Isak?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Hehe, I had a feeling he'd go looking for you.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You knew this would happen?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Yes. Although he tried his best to stay hidden, I still noticed him eavesdropping outside the window. He really wants to get his grandfather back.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 04.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Isak's parents were both Eremite mercenaries who rarely returned to the village after finding employment in the city. He was raised by his grandfather.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 05.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Unfortunately, it was only a few years before his grandpa passed away. Isak was still very young at the time, so various families in the village took turns caring for him so he could survive.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 06.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Later, an elderly mad scholar arrived at the village. Isak thought the scholar bore a striking resemblance to his grandfather, and thus often spied on the man.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 07.ogg}} '''Candace:''' However, the scholar was unkempt in appearance and incoherent in speech. Although Isak referred to the man as his "grandpa," he was afraid and didn't dare to approach him.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 08.ogg}} '''Candace:''' One summer night, the oft-mumbling and bumbling "grandpa" suddenly calmed down and seemed to become more lucid. He even noticed Isak hiding in the distance.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 09.ogg}} '''Candace:''' So "Grandpa" walked up to Isak and patted him on the head. He even took Isak to the entrance of the village, where he patiently taught the boy the names of the stars, and accompanied Isak until he fell asleep.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 10.ogg}} '''Candace:''' The next morning, Isak woke up and wanted to go find his "grandpa" again, only to realize his grandpa no longer recognized him. However, even so, Grandpa retained his calm expression.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 11.ogg}} '''Candace:''' It's said that those who saw the scholar claimed he no longer appeared to be crazy, but appeared to be living in his own world, almost as if he were sleepwalking.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 12.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Isak was thrilled that his "grandpa" was able to find peace, and would follow him all the time asking him things like, "Grandpa, want me to take you somewhere fun?" or "Grandpa, could you tell me stories about the stars again?"
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All this somehow just makes Paimon feel really sad... It seems like they both deserve so much better...
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 13.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Perhaps. Nearly everyone who lives in the desert has some form of hardship or regret. But even so, we must still continue on with our lives.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 14.ogg}} '''Candace:''' It's also my reason for fighting. I must continue to protect this land.
:'''(Traveler):''' ("Lucid grandpa" was probably Nahida... She must have soothed the other mad scholars as well.)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:'''(Traveler):''' (From the look on Cyno's face, he's probably connected the dots as well.)
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Maybe the people have always had a considerate god watching over them.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What did you say, Cyno?
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No, nothing. As long as Isak keeps his word and doesn't get in our way, we can take him along.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 candace 15.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Perhaps you are more compassionate than I gave you credit for. Please accept my thanks on Isak's behalf, Cyno.
----
<!--;(Leave the village chief's house, automatic)-->
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Isak!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 isak 01.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Ah, it's you guys!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've cleared everything up! Let's go find your grandpa!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 isak 02.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Really!? Wow, thank you so much!
:{{DIcon}} Your grandpa will be found safe and sound.
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 isak 03.ogg}} '''Isak:''' Yeah!
:{{A|vo xmaq103 8 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, let's ask the local residents some questions first.
