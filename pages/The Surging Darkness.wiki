==Gameplay Notes==
* From step 3 until the end of ''[[No One Fights Alone]]'', the player will be placed in a [[Special Story Mode]], but the story resets to after the last battle, if the mode is left, at least for after the first battle.
* During step 20, a trial [[Kinich]] joins the party.
* During this quest, the player will have two pairs of mutually exclusive options to choose from while addressing matters in Natlan. The options the player chooses will directly affect several steps during this quest and the upcoming quest [[Despair Engulfs the Heavens]], and once a decision is made, it cannot be reversed. Chosen options will decide the enemies faced, potential allies met and rescued.
* The numbers in the battle reports for "Abyssal Corrosion Level," "Active Monsters," and "Total Deaths" vary among players.<!--Depending on what factors? RNG? Speed or performance?-->

:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I see. I'll send reinforcements to those two locations. This other one is too dangerous &mdash; I'll handle it myself.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The remaining locations are remote, with no inhabitants. Let's bring our warriors back, and make sure they're careful on the retreat.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 tumpis 01.ogg}} '''Tumpis:''' Understood. I'll spread the word.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We're here. What's going on? Kachina said the Abyss attacked again?
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes. It's not looking good. Our forces have always been able to handle the sporadic attacks, but now, there are more monsters than ever, and the attacks are more frequent.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' What about the scale? What areas are they targeting?
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' All of Natlan. Not just around the Stadium, but even the remote areas of the Collective of Plenty are reporting attacks.

:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We won't last much longer, I know... What we're seeing now is the desperation of the Abyss. It knows we're only one hero short.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I don't have the strength to fight it right now. This is its best opportunity, and its final chance.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're saying... We just have to hold out for as long as we can?
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It'll be a long fight. Our current focus needs to be on protecting civilians and conserving manpower.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There are caravans and adventurers trapped in the wild. Many of our warriors have already left to rescue them, but they'll need reinforcements.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Leave that to us. We'll head out right away.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Alright. Xilonen, Kachina &mdash; head to the camp near the Children of Echoes. Citlali &mdash; you're needed in the Masters of the Night-Wind.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As an important figure in the plan, Ororon will stay here. Your tribe is too far from the Stadium.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Understood. I'll leave right away.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I prepared a hot air balloon to take you where you're needed.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 1 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Messengers from the Scions of the Canopy are traveling all around Natlan. Update them once you've completed your mission, and they'll compile the information into a battle report.

:{{A|vo ntaq106 21 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' It's true. She certainly helps us save manpower. She can handle the dangerous areas almost entirely on her own.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 21 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Alright, alright. I'm tired of this conversation. Either take a break or get moving already!
:{{A|vo ntaq106 21 kinich 08.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' A break sounds good. We won't be much help in the field if we're dead on our feet.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 21 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good idea. Maybe we can see if the people around here need anything in the meantime?
:{{DIcon}} Even on our break, we can still be helpful.

:{{A|vo ntaq106 27 botwe 01.ogg}} '''Botwe:''' It's only a "commission" if you get paid. This is something else entirely.
:{{A|vo ntaq106 27 kweku 01.ogg}} '''Kweku:''' Still, everyone's doing their part. There's more to adventuring than commission fees. Anyone can be an adventurer...

:;(If Tepoz was spoken to before)
:::{{A|vo dialog ntaq106 mayahuel 02.ogg}} '''Mayahuel:''' Oh, I didn't expect to see you here.
:::{{A|vo dialog ntaq106 mayahuel 03.ogg}} '''Mayahuel:''' My son wrote back to me and said things are under control on his end. That's one less thing to worry about for now.
:::{{A|vo dialog ntaq106 mayahuel 04.ogg}} '''Mayahuel:''' Anyway, I followed a group of warriors back here when I heard they needed medical personnel at the Stadium.
:::{{A|vo dialog ntaq106 mayahuel 05.ogg}} '''Mayahuel:''' My age means I can't charge to the frontlines, but I can handle things here. Everything will get better.

:::{{A|vo dialog ntaq106 kamaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamaka:''' The Captain's soldiers running around Natlan rescuing people... I almost couldn't believe it. I guess the Abyss really is our common enemy.

::{{A|vo dialog ntaq106 awhina 03.ogg}} '''Awhina:''' I've decided to bring these supplies to the Stadium, but this amount won't nearly be enough. There's a shortage pretty much everywhere.
::{{A|vo dialog ntaq106 awhina 04.ogg}} '''Awhina:''' We have emergency stockpiles of things like water, food, and medicine, but what if we'll need them even more in the future...?

:::{{A|vo ntaq106 29 raman 01.ogg}} '''Raman:''' Ah, it's you two! Thanks again for rescuing me.
:::{{A|vo ntaq106 29 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You know each other?
:::{{A|vo ntaq106 29 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we ran into him out in the wild. He was injured, but luckily, some saurians took him back to safety... Uh, speaking of which, are you sure you've recovered enough to be out and about like this?
:::{{A|vo ntaq106 29 raman 02.ogg}} '''Raman:''' Haha, I got really lucky &mdash; my injuries were just some flesh wounds. The doctor said they should heal on their own as long as I get enough rest, so I figured I'd try and keep working if I could.
:::{{A|vo ntaq106 29 raman 03.ogg}} '''Raman:''' But, uh, it didn't take me long to start regretting that decision... Everything's hurting now. As soon as I've delivered this battle report, I'm heading right back to go lie down.
:::{{A|vo ntaq106 29 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Sounds sensible. It's not a good idea to be taking risks while you're injured.
