==Text==
...[[Alain Guillotin|Alain]] made a huge [[Clockwork Meka#Lore|breakthrough]]. Everyone is discussing [[Fontaine]]'s energy revolution. But instead of praise, there seems to be more jealousy drifting around the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy|Institute]]. Although it has nothing to do with me, I'm still furious on his behalf...

...The adventurer we commissioned found something really valuable, a red gemstone that appeared on the [[Dragonspine|snowy mountains]] of [[Mondstadt]] after the [[Cataclysm|disaster]]. Its properties are very similar to the flesh and blood of Elynas (verified by [[Jakob]]). It's supposedly a product of the [[Durin|great dragon]]'s decaying corpse (in order to reduce confusion, it will hereinafter be referred to as [[Scarlet Quartz]])... Although it generates heat and has the effect of increasing explosive power, the toxins it contains mean ordinary humans cannot withstand it, with the exception of ①Neohumans (tentative name) like Jakob ②capable of detoxifying it (none have been found yet)... Another similar discovery is the [[Dark Mud|filth]] in the [[The Chasm|great mines]] of [[Liyue]]...

...Unfortunately, I've hit a snag in my research. The biggest challenge is how to reproduce results... But if I can obtain sufficient resources, I'm certain I can overcome this... At the very least, the idiots on our side still admire (fear) us. The tricks I put Jakob up to were very quite effective... Even though it's quite sad that people from an Institute of Natural Philosophy have somewhat turned into believers, at least I can entrust them with simple tasks... Let's use that name to form a "[[Narzissenkreuz Ordo|society]]" for now. I'll use it as a means to give them organization and a sense of belonging...

...But [[Carter Scherbius|Carter]] is unconscious. I took samples of his blood and skin and got a swift catspaw to take it to [[Sumeru]] to be looked at... other from observing the problem, the root of the problem cannot be found. It's pointless, absolutely pointless. Conventional medicine is pointless. I must figure something else out...

...Jakob... Jakob's proposal is very dangerous. I must give it more thought.

...

...I told Carter everything and had Jakob prove his strength and [[Iniquitous Baptist|transformation]]. I even explained the risks, its historical baggage, and my other objective: To create a second sample that can corroborate the realization of human transcendence via [[Abyss|██]], and derive the holistic character and method from it. Carter isn't very good at thinking scientifically, so I used many examples and methods of emphasis. But he seems to have made up his mind from the beginning.

...

...Still deteriorating.<br>
...It seems Jakob's successful integration was an extreme case. Or perhaps he's not himself anymore? I can't be sure.

...<br>
...I must continue observing. It can't be a waste. It can't be a waste. Or else it will all have been for nothing, utterly meaningless. I got more materials in an attempt to reverse it. All sorts of relics and biological tissue from after the [[Cataclysm|calamity]]. I even got my hands on extremely [[Dark Mud|dangerous residue]]. Nothing worked. But I can't give up. He's still "alive" right now. At the very least, in this sense, it can continue. It cannot be a waste.

...<br>
...He's preserved for now and further tissue collapse has been prevented. Jakob doesn't tear up at the sight of him anymore... but occasionally Carter's voice is occasionally heard from... and that's the worst. I've tried cutting out the organs where his vocal cords probably are, but they grow back in one to three days...

...<br>
...Alain and I have completely broken off our working relationship. It's regrettable, but I don't blame him... The most regrettable part is the previous direction was proved to be ineffective, but it wasn't all for naught. Identifying the errors made was the greatest benefit. Due to the short lifespans, the cost of trial and error is very high. On this account, I must thank Carter. So, I must find a way to save him. I must prove that I can do it... Another thing I gained is members of the society have grown more loyal. Aren't I a talented actor?

...<br>
...During my discussion with Jakob, I thought of [[Narzissenkreuz|another direction]] that's worth trying. It may be the solution to everything...

[Most of the remaining content cannot be deciphered due to the thoughts expressed being utterly incoherent.]
