{{Description|In the movement when lightning strikes, you can sometimes glimpse the look of a predator sizing up his prey deep within Razor's eyes.}}
'''Claw and Thunder''' is [[Razor]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*{{TalentNote|particles|3|4}}
**No elemental particles are generated if the Elemental Burst [[Lightning Fang]] is active.
**The Press version of this skill also generates elemental particles when [[wildlife]] or a [[pet]] is struck. This is currently the only skill that does so.
*The Electro Sigils last 18 seconds. They are not lost when Razor leaves the field, but the timer continues.
*Each Electro Sigil increases Razor's energy recharge by '''20%'''. This bonus is still active when out of the field.
*When the Hold version of Claw and Thunder is used, or when [[Lightning Fang]] is used, the Electro Sigils are absorbed and each generate '''5 energy'''.

==Trivia==
* Razor's master is [[Lisa]], who taught him how to harness his Electro powers.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Razor|5}}</ref> As the talent's description suggests, Claw and Thunder bears some similarity to Lisa's Elemental Skill, [[Violet Arc]]:<section begin="Razor-Lisa Skills" />
** Both involve a status effect which is applied upon striking an opponent with the Talent's Tap effect, and stacks up to three times.
** Both have a Hold effect that deals massive {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} and consumes their respective status effect stacks for an additional effect.
** Both have a Hold visual effect in which the sky is darkened with purple clouds.<section end="Razor-Lisa Skills" />
* Razor's voice-over use for [[Claw and Thunder]] and [[Lightning Fang]] are inconsistent with the Voice-Overs menu in his profile as well as across all four languages.
