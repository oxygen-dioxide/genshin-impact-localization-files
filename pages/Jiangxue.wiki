{{Lang|'''Jiangxue'''|zh=江雪|zh_rm=Jiāngxuě}} is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Liyue]]. He can be found near the [[Wangshu Inn]] in [[Dihua Marsh]].

Allegedly a fisherman, it is quickly apparent that he's simply fishing to wile away his time, choosing this peaceful lifestyle to repent for the "bad things" he's done.

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player five [[Fish]].

<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Jiangxue is much more powerful than he appears. He once held a [[Vision]], which he has since discarded after doing "bad things" with it. Even without a Vision or even a weapon, he can sense when and where monsters will appear, and singlehandedly takes down a [[Ruin Hunter]] within seconds without seemingly moving.<ref name="FJX">{{Ref/Quest|Fishing Jiangxue}}</ref>

His past is vaguely alluded to; [[Smiley Yanxiao]] has known him for a long time and claims that he is the only person willing to give him food following a mysterious incident in Jiangxue's past. Jiangxue also admits to the Traveler that he once went to Dihua Marsh to do "bad things," but that those things were also something he "had to do."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Yanxiao's Dilemma}}</ref> Following the aftermath of that event, Jiangxue discarded his original name and his Vision, then took up his current alias. His past seems to weigh heavily upon him, as he mentions that he is "still unable to wholly let go" and that he has not released a [[Xiao Lantern]] of his own for "a long time."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Yanxiao's Crazy Kitchen}}</ref>

At some point prior to his current predicament, he helped someone with a problem who invited him to a feast in gratitude, where he learned the [[Chicken Tofu Pudding]] recipe, although he was unable to make it for himself. He would later teach it to the [[Traveler]] and Smiley Yanxiao.

In the quests [[Fishing Jiangxue]] and [[Yanxiao's Crazy Kitchen]], Jiangxue can be found slightly northeast of Wangshu Inn, in [[Dihua Marsh]], on a small islet that has several stone beast statues in a circular formation. These statues are not discussed in dialogue, but it is possible that they were formerly adepti who asked [[Rex Lapis]] to turn their bodies to stone after the [[Archon War]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|1|Stone Beasts}}</ref> It is currently unclear what significance this area has and why Jiangxue can be found near these statues.

==Trivia==
* Jiangxue is mentioned in [[Teyvat Travel Guide - Liyue]] as "that fisherman from the inn" who sat on [[Alice]]'s seashell necklace, crushing them under his "merciless buttocks" and injuring himself in the process, forcing her to pay his medical bills.

===Etymology===
* In Chinese, Jiangxue's name can be translated as "River Snow" {{Lang|zh=江雪}}. The inspiration behind his name and his related Daily Commission, [[Fishing Jiangxue]], is a reference to a poem written by the Tang Dynasty poet {{w|Liu Zongyuan}}, also titled {{zh|江雪|rm=Jiāngxuě}}. The relevant lines read, "In a lone boat, an old man, in rain hat and straw raincoat / Fishing alone, in the cold river snow" {{Lang|zh=孤舟蓑笠翁，独钓寒江雪|zh_rm=gūzhōu suōlǐ-wēng, dúdiào hán jiāngxuě}}.
