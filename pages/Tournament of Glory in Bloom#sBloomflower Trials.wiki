{{Description|Participate in the defense with {{Color|BP|Citlali}}.<br>Mystic arts and intellect are not merely tools for researching the unknown, but the foundation of securing victory in warfare. On a battlefield of their own making, the Masters of the Night-Wind shall never fail.}}

;Martial Trial Scenarios
* When a character triggers {{Color|BP|Frozen or Melt}} on an enemy, the CRIT DMG of all characters in the team will increase by {{Color|BP|60%}} for {{Color|BP|5}}s.
* Within {{Color|BP|50}}s of receiving the buff, after the current on-field character {{Color|BP|creates a shield}}, a shockwave will be released at the character's position, dealing True DMG and {{Color|BP|interrupting}} enemies. A shockwave can be released in this way once every {{Color|BP|15}}s. Additionally, characters protected by a shield will gain a {{Color|BP|40%}} All Elemental DMG Bonus and {{Color|BP|taunt}} nearby enemies, attracting their attacks.

;(The first time a flag receives damage)
:{{A|vo nteq003 13 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Someone's broken through our defenses? That doesn't sound too promising.

;(The first time a flag receives damage at least 10 seconds after the above line plays)
:{{A|vo nteq003 13 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Well, that was careless of us. Fall back!

;(When the second group appears)

;(When the third group appears)
