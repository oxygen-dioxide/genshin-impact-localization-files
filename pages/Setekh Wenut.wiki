==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''

===Phase 1===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Sweep
|desc_1      = Sweeps the ground in front of it with its body, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}.

|name_2      = Spit
|desc_2      = Shoots 3 projectiles at the player, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

|name_3      = Transition to Phase 2
|desc_3      = Digs out of the ground, travels an arcing trajectory midair and reenters the ground, exposing itself to attacks, signifying the transition to Phase 2.
|file_3      = Setekh Wenut Arc
}}

===Phase 2===
Phase 2 starts when the Setekh Wenut's [[HP]] reaches '''97.5%''', or when '''20''' seconds have passed since the beginning of the fight. After entering Phase 2, the Setekh Wenut will no longer use attacks from Phase 1.
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Thrust
|desc_1      = Drills out of the ground from below the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}.

|name_2      = Stream of Gales
|desc_2      = Surfaces at the center of the arena and fires countless projectiles in all directions, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

|name_3      = Stormbreath
|desc_3      = Sweeps the arena with a massive surge of Anemo energy, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

|name_4      = Pressurized Beam
|desc_4      = Fires a beam of Anemo energy that deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} on hit.

|name_5      = Dig
|desc_5      = Digs out of the ground and back in, exposing itself to attacks.
}}

===Phase 3===
Phase 3 starts when the Setekh Wenut's [[HP]] reaches '''50%''', or when '''60''' seconds have passed since the beginning of Phase 2. After entering Phase 3, the Setekh Wenut will immediately use '''Floating State''', but all attacks from Phase 2 will still be available afterwards.
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1     = Floating State
|desc_1     = Suspends itself midair and conjures 6 Windbite Bullets. After some time, absorbs all Windbite Bullets and fires 3 rounds of projectiles each covering expanding circular areas of the arena. Each projectile deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}} upon landing.
* Windbite Bullets will be destroyed when hit by {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}} attacks.
* If 2 Windbite Bullets are destroyed in succession, the Setekh Wenut will become paralyzed for ~10 seconds.
* While paralyzed, it also loses '''45%''' [[RES]] to the elements that its Windbite Bullets were destroyed by.
|file_1_2    = Setekh Wenut Floating State 2
|caption_1_2 = Paralyzed
|strat_1     = A {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}} [[Bow]] user, especially one matching the element of the team's primary damage dealer, is helpful in this fight for taking full advantage of the Setekh Wenut's paralysis. Alternatively, Coordinated Attacks from [[Raiden Shogun]]'s [[Transcendence: Baleful Omen|Elemental Skill]] or [[Swirl]] Elemental Reactions triggered on the boss itself can reliably hit the Windbite Bullets.
}}

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|An eyeless predator from deep within the Great Red Sand that uses sound and vibrations to seek out its prey.<br />Legend has it that in the ancient past before even the concept of time was created, these creatures thrived with their progenitors and offspring in a land of verdant grass and colossal trees, traversing through slick soil like fishes diving through the wet.<br />With the passage of eons, the gifts of heaven has long reduced the soils to sand, rendering a great many creatures extinct. This branch of their genus was able to survive by adapting more toward earth-based living, and became known as the "Wenut."<br />Some desert folk still mistakenly believe that sandworms are the final point of a quicksand eel's life cycle, likely due to superficial similarities between the species' behaviors.|[[Archive]]}}

==Lord of the Desert==
{{Description|Legend has it that in the distant past, the scorching desert was once home to fragrant flowers and giant trees, and was inhabited by countless birds and beasts. Legend also has it that the only ones who remember it are the blind predators respectfully and fearfully referred to as "Wenut."}}
