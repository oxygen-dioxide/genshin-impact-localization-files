==Abilities==
''Most ability names are unofficial.''

===Phase 1===
This phase is skipped in the [[Spiral Abyss]].
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Sweep
|desc_1      = Sweeps the ground in front of it with its body, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.

|name_2      = Spit
|desc_2      = Shoots 3 projectiles at the player, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

|name_3      = Transition to Phase 2
|desc_3      = Digs out of the ground, travels an arcing trajectory midair and reenters the ground, exposing itself to attacks, signifying the transition to Phase 2.
|file_3      = Setekh Wenut Arc
}}

===Phase 2===
Phase 2 starts when the Setekh Wenut's [[HP]] reaches '''97.5%''', or when '''20''' seconds have passed since the beginning of the fight. After entering Phase 2, the Setekh Wenut will no longer use attacks from Phase 1.
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Thrust
|desc_1      = Drills out of the ground from below the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.

|name_2      = Stream of Gales
|desc_2      = Surfaces at the center of the arena and fires countless projectiles in all directions, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

|name_3      = Stormbreath
|desc_3      = Sweeps the arena with a massive surge of Anemo energy, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.

|name_4      = Pressurized Beam
|desc_4      = Fires a beam of Anemo energy that deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} on hit.

|name_5      = Dig
|desc_5      = Digs out of the ground and back in, exposing itself to attacks.
}}

===Phase 3===
Phase 3 starts when the Setekh Wenut's [[HP]] reaches '''50%''', or when '''60''' seconds have passed since the beginning of Phase 2. After entering Phase 3, the Setekh Wenut will immediately use '''Floating State''', but all attacks from Phase 2 will still be available afterwards.
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1     = Floating State
|desc_1     = Suspends itself midair and conjures 6 Windbite Bullets. After some time, absorbs all Windbite Bullets and fires 3 rounds of projectiles each covering expanding circular areas of the arena. Each projectile deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} upon landing.
* Windbite Bullets will be destroyed when hit by {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}} attacks.
* If 2 Windbite Bullets are destroyed in succession, the Setekh Wenut will become paralyzed for ~10 seconds.
* While paralyzed, it also loses '''45%''' [[RES]] to the elements that its Windbite Bullets were destroyed by.
|file_1_2    = Setekh Wenut Floating State 2
|caption_1_2 = Paralyzed
|strat_1     = A {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}/{{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}} [[Bow]] user, especially one matching the element of the team's primary damage dealer, is helpful in this fight for taking full advantage of the Setekh Wenut's paralysis. Alternatively, coordinated attacks from [[Raiden Shogun's Elemental Skill]] and [[Dehya's Elemental Skill]] or [[Swirl]] Elemental Reactions triggered on the boss itself can reliably hit the Windbite Bullets.
}}

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

{{Description|An eyeless predator from deep within the [[Great Red Sand]] that uses sound and vibrations to seek out its prey.<br>Legend has it that in the ancient past before even the concept of [[Erosion|time]] was created, these creatures thrived with their [[Seven Sovereigns|progenitors]] and offspring in a land of verdant grass and colossal trees, traversing through slick soil like fishes diving through the wet.<br>With the passage of eons, the [[Celestial Nail|gifts]] of [[Celestia|heaven]] has long reduced the soils to sand, rendering a great many creatures extinct. This branch of their genus was able to survive by adapting more toward earth-based living, and became known as the "[[Wenut]]."<br>Some desert folk still mistakenly believe that sandworms are the final point of a [[Quicksand Eel|quicksand eel]]'s life cycle, likely due to superficial similarities between the species' behaviors.|[[Archive]]}}
{{Description|An eyeless predator that dwells within the depths of the desert and uses sound and vibrations to seek out its prey.<br>They sometimes take on forms very similar to those of plants, and some say that this is because they were once the scions of the [[Apep|lord of plants]]. Others say that this is their way of fooling their prey to seek fruits or food in their deadly shade.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
