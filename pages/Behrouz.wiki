==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Behrouz:''' Sea monsters and [[Kairagi]]... Both troublesome issues.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Behrouz:''' I'm the owner of a nearby merchant ship, and I mainly deal with import and export.
::'''Behrouz:''' If you have a good source of excellent goods or trade routes, please do acquaint me. We can talk about share ratios.
::'''Behrouz:''' It would be even better if I can have fine goods like gems and silks from [[Liyue]], or [[Fontaine]] boats.
:{{DIcon}} Troublesome issues?
::'''Behrouz:''' You probably know that we cross-border merchants fear mishaps at sea the most.
::'''Behrouz:''' I'm a seasoned ship owner, and very experienced in dealing with the issues, but these sea monsters still give me headaches.
::'''Behrouz:''' And there are those vicious Kairagi too. It's no joke when they sink fortunes.
::'''Behrouz:''' It's best to avoid things like these if possible. I'll need to plan my next sailing route now...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Behrouz:''' See you. Be safe at sea.
