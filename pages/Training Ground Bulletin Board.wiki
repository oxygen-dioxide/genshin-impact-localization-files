===Introduction===
:'''Training Ground Announcement:''' "This training ground is open to everyone as a place to train and work out. Please follow the rules and observe basic etiquette. Only by encouraging each other can we improve as one!"
:'''Training Ground Announcement:''' "In addition, newcomers are recommended to seek the help and advice of our [[Tecoma|resident coach]], to make sure you're doing it right. Remember, we're here to train, and muscle strains kill gains!"

===Dubious Advice===
:'''One Trainee's Message:''' "Ugh, I've been working out for a long time, but I don't seem to have gotten any stronger. Where should I be focusing my efforts to finally break through?"
:'''Another Trainee's Message:''' "That's an easy one &mdash; just do ten push-ups and ten sit-ups every day, then add in ten squats and ten laps around the edge of the tribal territory, then keep that going for three years or so, and you'll be as strong as Coach [[Iansan]]."
:'''The First Trainee's Message:''' "As strong as Coach Iansan? Impossible! That routine is barely training &mdash; I do more than that already!"
:'''The Second Trainee's Message:''' "You're missing the key point! If you follow my plan, you just need three years &mdash; then you'll lose all your hair, and then you'll be strong!"
:'''Resident Coach's Response:''' "Hey! Don't go around giving bogus advice! And don't believe everything you read in your silly novels &mdash; bald people aren't always strong!"

===No Pain, No Gain===
:'''Superficial Handwriting:''' "Do you guys think there might be a way to get strong without having to train hard? You know, something like the mystic arts of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]?"
:'''Resident Coach's Response:''' "As our Coach says, 'There beeth<!-- not a typo; archaic form of "to be" --> no gain without pain.' Besides, all mystic arts come with a cost. For the sake of your health, I strongly advise you not to try."
:'''Superficial Handwriting:''' "You say there's no pain without gain... But, have you ever experienced that? How do you know?"
:'''Superficial Handwriting:''' "You say all mystic arts come with a cost... But, have you ever tried some? If not, how do you know?
:'''Resident Coach's Response:''' "...Just you wait. I'll take you through a training session tomorrow &mdash; you'll find out how I know soon enough!"

===Q&A Announcement===
:'''Club Announcement:''' "Having received multiple requests, the club will be organizing a training talk and Q&A with Coach lansan, where she will discuss strength training and weight loss. If anyone has any specific questions, feel free to ask them here.‚Äù
:'''Superficial Handwriting:''' "I understand now! Simply controlling what I eat and drink isn't enough. I need to adopt a more practical and effective approach!"
:'''Resident Coach's Response:''' "It's great to see you've finally got the message! Come sign up, I'll help you create the most effective training regimen possible! You'll see that six-pack poking through in no time!"
:'''Superficial Handwriting:''' "Ugh, I've trained for three months straight now, and I bought all the equipment. Why am I not getting any thinner? If anything, I think I'm putting on more weight!"
:'''Resident Coach's Response:''' "Well... You could try coming to the training grounds more often... You're not going to see much progress training once a month!"

===Motivational Message===
:'''Training Ground Announcement:''' "As the saying goes, muscles are honest and wise, strength is wise and honest. If you want to grow muscles and strength, then you need to be both honest and wise."
:'''Training Ground Announcement:''' "Honesty, as you all know, means hard work and perseverance, while wisdom means training correctly, just like Coach Iansan."
:'''Iansan's Message:''' "If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or anyone else from the club, and we'll do our best to help you create a personalized training plan."
:'''Iansan's Follow-Up Message:''' "Wisdom means training in the correct way and not cutting corners! Never use shady techniques or dubious supplements &mdash; the risk is not worth the reward!"

===Never Skip Leg Day===
:'''Trainee Message:''' "When will Coach Iansan be at the training grounds? I haven't been making much progress lately and was hoping to ask the coach for help."
:'''A Different Trainee's Message:''' "Me too! Me too!"
:'''Iansan's Message:''' "Very well, your opportunity is here. Tomorrow is leg day for me, so if the two of you want to tag along, you can train legs with me! You can ask me whatever it is you want while we train."
:'''Trainee Message:''' "Ah... Leg day... Coach, my legs are still shaking from a whole day of moving grain yesterday! Maybe I can tag along another time..."
:'''Iansan's Message:''' "And what about our other friend? Are your legs aching too?"
:'''The Other Trainee's Message:''' "Me? I... I was just hit by a falling rock! I had to have my legs amputated! Oh, the pain, the tremendous, very genuine pain! I'm so sorry Coach, I'm afraid I can't go..."
:'''Iansan's Message:''' "Nonsense! Nobody skips leg day when Coach lansan's around! How will you make progress with an attitude like that? I'm coming to pick you both up personally tomorrow, and you are going. To. Train!"
