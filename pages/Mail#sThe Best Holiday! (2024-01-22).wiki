|text      = Mrow... It's been so cold lately, that I can't even stretch my tail out of my box at night! But once the weather gets cold, I know my "birthday" is coming up! To be more precise, it's the day I stopped being a normal cat and started being a youkai.

A birthday truly is such a happy day! All my colleagues at the [[Komaniya Express]] give me gifts and treat me to all kinds of delicious snacks, and the boss even gives a special approval for a paid day off! It's simply the best holiday in human society!

Though what I really want to do is turn back into a little cat, go back home, and eat the nekomanma Granny makes for me.

Will you come along? As long as I rub against your leg, Granny will know you're my friend!

If I could curl up into a little ball and sleep by the fire while you tell awesome adventure stories, that would be purrfect!
