{{Quest Description|[[Aratani]], an editor at the [[Yae Publishing House]], seems to have something he'd like a little help with...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Aratani)
:'''Aratani:''' Ugh, how am I supposed to contact these two authors in this situation...
:{{DIcon}} Contact who now?
:'''Aratani:''' Oh! Traveler, it's you... Thank goodness you're here. I was just in need of someone's help!
:'''Aratani:''' Here's the problem: Yae Publishing House's annual novel-writing competition is about to begin, and as is our rule, we plan to invite a few of our writers to serve on the judging panel.
:'''Aratani:''' However, we have two writers who are neither Inazuman, nor do they currently reside in Inazuma.
;(Before [[Transient Dreams]])
::'''Aratani:''' As you know, the present circumstances prevent us from inviting outlanders here.
::'''Aratani:''' But if we fail to inform the writers of such an important matter, that would also be inappropriate.
;(After Transient Dreams)
::'''Aratani:''' As you know, the journey here is a long and tiring one over land and sea, and it will be quite the undertaking to bring both authors here.
::'''Aratani:''' It would be nice, of course, if they could come. But regardless, it would not be polite of us to not even give them so much as notification that the event is occurring.
:'''Aratani:''' So I thought that if someone could at least send them a gift, the basic courtesies would at least be satisfied. And we could also attach a letter discussing future manuscripts&mdash; *cough* I mean...
:'''Aratani:''' Would you be willing to help me out?
:{{DIcon}} I'll take care of it.
::'''Aratani:''' We're counting on you, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} Who are these writers again?
::'''Aratani:''' One of them is named Zhenyu, and the other is... Chang the Ninth.
:'''Aratani:''' Chang the Ninth's story, known as the "First Apprentice of Guhua," is a tale about the first apprentice of a famed martial arts school in Liyue and a young girl from Inazuma whom he took on as a junior apprentice.
:'''Aratani:''' If you were to ask me, the themes and plot are just a little outdated by this point, but enough readers buy it to keep sales up.
:'''Aratani:''' We often ask people to send some letters to him to suggest certain changes he might make in future works to perhaps make a breakthrough...
:'''Aratani:''' But we have never received a reply. Perhaps the letters were lost in the way, or...
:{{DIcon}} Who's Zhenyu?
:'''Aratani:''' Now this one, I have no idea about. It's likely a pen name of some sort.
:'''Aratani:''' But the book "A Legend of Sword"? That one's an earth-shatterer and a world-shaker, make no mistake!
:'''Aratani:''' Both the setting and the story have sent veritable shocks throughout the literary world!
:{{DIcon}} Well, where do I find this writer, then...
:'''Aratani:''' Hmm. I believe that this writer also lives in Liyue. According to a traveling merchant who brought this book back to Inazuma, he first found this text at Wanwen Bookhouse.
:'''Aratani:''' I think that if you ask the staff at Wanwen Bookhouse, you should be able to find this author.
:'''Aratani:''' However... *cough* Well, never mind that for now. Here are the presents and the letters. {{sic|I've}} putting this in your reliable hands, Traveler!
;(Obtain [[Chang the Ninth's Gift]] and [[Zhenyu's Gift]])

;(Talk to Aratani again)
:'''Aratani:''' *sigh* When will we be able to see Mr. Zhenyu's next work?
----
;(Talk to Chang the Ninth)
:'''Chang the Ninth:''' Hmm? Traveler? What brings you to my home today?
:{{DIcon}} Here's a letter and a gift from Yae Publishing House.
:'''Chang the Ninth:''' A letter from Yae Publishing House? They're not asking me to change my pen name again, are they?
:'''Chang the Ninth:''' I've told them a thousand times that I'll write under my real name...
:'''Chang the Ninth:''' *sigh* Oh, forget it. Let me have a look...

:'''''Chang the Ninth reads the letter from the Yae Publishing House...'''''

:'''Chang the Ninth:''' They want me to judge a novel-writing contest... Hmm. I don't think I have the time, but I suppose I should thank them, anyway...
:'''Chang the Ninth:''' Eh? What's all this? These are... "creative suggestions"...
:'''Chang the Ninth:''' Uh, I&mdash;I'll have to read these a bit more carefully. Thank you, Traveler.

;(Talk to Chang the Ninth again)
:'''Chang the Ninth:''' How are there this many suggestions for future writing subjects...

;(While walking away from Chang the Ninth)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's Chang the Ninth's letter delivered. Now for this Zhenyu guy!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Let's go to Wanwen Bookhouse and ask around.

----
;(While Approaching Xingqiu)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, isn't that... Xingqiu? Oh, right! He's read a lot of books &mdash; maybe he'll know where to find our man! Let's go and ask him.

;(Talk to Xingqiu)
:'''Xingqiu:''' Hmm, this part is indeed well-written, and the progression is so very novel...
:{{DIcon}} Xingqiu.
:'''Xingqiu:''' Oh, so that's what happens. Fascinating...
:{{DIcon}} Xingqiu!
:'''Xingqiu:''' Hmm? Ah, it's you, (Traveler). It has been a while.
:'''Xingqiu:''' From the way you greeted me, you seem well. That is good... What brings you here today?
:'''Paimon:''' Actually, we were hoping to ask you to find someone for us. You've read a ton of books, so you probably know.
:'''Xingqiu:''' A person? Are you looking for a writer, then? Hmm... certainly, ask away.
:{{DIcon}} We're looking for a certain "Zhenyu"...
:'''Xingqiu:''' Zhenyu? Wh&mdash;Where did you hear this name?
:{{DIcon}} It says so right here on this copy of "A Legend of Sword"...
:'''Paimon:''' We're looking for this Zhenyu person because someone from Yae Publishing House in Inazuma asked us to pass them a letter.
:'''Paimon:''' Would you know who this Zhenyu person is?
:'''Xingqiu:''' Well, this Zhenyu of whom you speak...
:'''Xingqiu:''' This is embarrassing, but... that's my pen name.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh!?
:{{DIcon}} Well, that's one we've never heard of.
:'''Xingqiu:''' Well, it's certainly nothing worth mentioning.
:'''Xingqiu:''' Initially, the editor in charge of this book here in Liyue told me that "the setting is too outlandish while the plot is unexpectedly clich√©d. No one will like this," and rejected my manuscript.
:'''Xingqiu:''' I didn't feel like taking that lying down, so I had a few copies printed myself before planting them surreptitiously into Wanwen Bookhouse to see if anyone would like them.
:'''Xingqiu:''' As it turned out, readers were few and far between, so I did not pay it any more mind. I never thought that it would become so popular in Inazuma.
:'''Xingqiu:''' Still, I'm quite pleased that people are willing to read what I've written.
:'''Xingqiu:''' I shall read this letter carefully, Traveler. Thank you.
:;(Achievement awarded at this point)

;(Talk to Xingqiu again)
:'''Xingqiu:''' Still, I wonder &mdash; how did the book that I wrote manage to make it over the ocean to Inazuma?
:'''Xingqiu:''' Did some passing Inazuman merchant buy the book before bringing it home with them?
----
;(Report back to Aratani)
:'''Aratani:''' Oh, you're back at last! How did it go? Did you find our two authors?
:{{DIcon}} I did. The letters have been delivered.
:'''Aratani:''' That's wonderful! What did they say, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} They both said that they'd read the letters with care.
:'''Aratani:''' Good, good. *sigh* It's just a shame that they're both far away in Liyue. Even were things more normal, we couldn't easily go to visit them.
:'''Aratani:''' This is especially the case for Mr. Zhenyu. His book, "A Legend of Sword," wasn't even submitted by him, but by a traveling merchant.
:'''Aratani:''' Later, one of our editors would read this book, and seeing its value, they prepared to go to Liyue personally and arrange for more manuscripts to be written.
;(Before [[Transient Dreams]])
::'''Aratani:''' Who would've thought that with these changes in our situation, none of our letters that we sought to have people bring to Liyue ever returned.
::'''Aratani:''' We could only publish the books first, while keeping a record of the royalties owed to Mr. Zhenyu. Once we'd established contact, we would send the royalties over.
::'''Aratani:''' But it's been so long, and still "A Legend of Sword" remains a bestseller. The royalties are starting to pile up...
;(After Transient Dreams)
::'''Aratani:''' But who would've thought... The situation here kept changing, one of our plans kept getting delayed, and none of the letters we had sent ever returned.
::'''Aratani:''' We could only publish the books first, while keeping a record of the royalties owed to Mr. Zhenyu. Once we'd established contact, we would send the royalties over.
:'''Aratani:''' *sigh* How I wish Mr. Zhenyu could attend this competition. These royalties can't be left to pile up like this much longer...
