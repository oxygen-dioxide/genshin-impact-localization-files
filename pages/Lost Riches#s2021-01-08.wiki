|[[The Path of the Treasure-Seeker, Part I]]
|January 8, 2021
|}

==Event Mechanics==
*There are 14 Treasure Areas in the Treasure Book corresponding to a location. Two areas are revealed each day in the Treasure Book.
*There are also 2 Special Treasures unlocked with Treasure Area 3 (day 2) and Treasure Area 7 (day 4) that contain [[Primogem]]s and other rewards.
*There are also Co-Op Challenges that are dug up as the last dig spot when digging in specific Treasure Areas, starting with Treasure Area 4 (day 2).
*Activating the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] obtained from the [[The Path of the Treasure-Seeker, Part I|starting quest]] from [[Ulman]] can only be done in a Treasure Area and has a 30s cooldown. When not in a Treasure Area, it will not have any effect and will enter a 5s cooldown.
*When within a two sprint radius of a spot, the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] will shine and beep and the spot will be revealed on the ground to be dug up. Digging up a spot rewards 4, 8, 16, or 20 [[Iron Coin]]s, for a maximum of 60 [[Iron Coin]]s per treasure area. When a character is in a combat state, the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] will disappear and will only reappear (without a need to resummon) when the battle is over. Interestingly, dig spots will still be found and shown on the ground even in a combat state, though without the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]]'s shine and beeping as additional aids. However, the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] will be dismissed completely and needs to be equipped and resummoned again if the character switches to another equipped gadget.
*Sometimes, after digging up Iron Coins, [[Treasure Hoarders]] will appear. As stated above, they do not have to be fought as new dig spots will still be shown even during combat.
*When all treasures have been collected for the day, using the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] will give the message: "It seems that there are no treasures left to collect today. Summon Treasure-Seeking Seelie tomorrow and try your luck again!".
*Iron Coins can be exchanged in the event shop for a choice of one of the commemorative event gadgets [[Mini Seelie: Dayflower]], [[Mini Seelie: Ros√©]], or [[Mini Seelie: Curcuma]] after exploring Treasure Area 14 (day 7). The Mini Seelie you exchange for does not expire, but it cannot be used to search for more Iron Coins.

===Tutorial: Treasure Areas===
[[File:Tutorial Lost Riches 1.png|200px|thumb|left]]Check the treasure map within [[Ulman]]'s Treasure Book. Follow the map to reach the area where the treasure is buried.<br />Ulman will mark out two new areas in this book each day, for a total of 14 treasure areas.{{clr}}
[[File:Tutorial Lost Riches 2.png|200px|thumb|left]]If you equip the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] from your Inventory, you can summon it when in a treasure area. However, if you are not in a treasure area, or you are inside a treasure area but too far from the treasure, the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] will not answer your summons.{{clr}}
[[File:Tutorial Lost Riches 3.png|200px|thumb|left]]When you draw near to where the treasure is hidden, the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] will begin to shine, and the intensity will increase the closer you get to the treasure.<br />When the treasure appears, the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] will shine with a special light...{{clr}}
[[File:Tutorial Lost Riches 4.png|200px|thumb|left]]The [[Iron Coin]]s seem to be the treasures that [[Ulman]] is really after...<br />Find and obtain all the [[Iron Coin]]s in an area to complete the exploration of that area.{{clr}}
===Tutorial: Co-Op Challenges===
[[File:Tutorial Lost Riches 5.png|200px|thumb|left]]While searching for treasure, you might encounter difficult challenges that might be easier to surmount should you have the help of teammates...<br />Once you complete the challenge, all team members will obtain the rewards.{{clr}}
[[File:Tutorial Lost Riches 6.png|200px|thumb|left]]Throughout the entire event, you may collect a total of three Co-Op challenge rewards in other player's worlds.<br />Once the event ends, you will not be able to take part in these Co-Op Challenges.{{clr}}
