* Despite being added in [[Version 2.3]], this achievement could not be earned until January 10, 2022 at the earliest, due to its high requirements. The game was in [[Version 2.4]] during this date. <!--Since 11 nets are given for completing the quest, 19 nets must be purchased, which takes 4 weeks minimum if 5 are purchased every week. Counting from the week of December 20, 2021 (when the quest became available), the Monday of the 4th week is January 10, 2022.-->
