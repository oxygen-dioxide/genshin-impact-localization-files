==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Wagner is the main blacksmith in Mondstadt. He owns a blacksmith named after his apprentice, Schulz, whom he has lost a bet with over who could drink the most. Wagner ended up losing and was forced to change the business name as a result. Sometime later, [[Lawrence]]'s father, a merchant from [[Fontaine]], had a drinking contest with Wagner. Not knowing about the infamy of the [[Lawrence Clan]] at the time, Lawrence's father would have to call his son Lawrence. Fortunately, Wagner was able to win; if he had lost, then he would have had to name his prized weapon "Pinky the Rabbit".<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Lawrence}}</ref>

Rumor has it that when [[Noelle]] was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion. In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for her, but all would lose their edge after a few uses. At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: due to her superhuman strength, the swords just weren't strong enough.

Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally custom-made Noelle a sturdy and heavy [[claymore]] that was further reinforced by her affinity for [[Geo]]. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Noelle|4}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Wagner is a burly man with dark hair and dark eyes, donning a white shirt.

:::'''Wagner:''' Okay, I've got other things to do...
:{{DIcon|!}} Any tips on finding ore in Mondstadt?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Wagner knows; Version 1)
:::'''Wagner:''' You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
:::'''Wagner:''' Luckily for you, I did in fact come across some odd-looking Crystal Ore recently. It's called Magical Crystal Ore and it's a lot more powerful than your regular one.
:::'''Wagner:''' I, for one, don't have the skill to deal with that kind of power. It could be that it takes more than the work of a smith to process that kind of thing.
:::'''Wagner:''' ...I've marked a few locations of Magical Crystal Ore on your map. Go fetch some and see what you make of it.
:::'''Wagner:''' You must let me know if you figure out how to make use of it... I can't stand being shown up as a blacksmith by a bunch of stupid rocks.

:::'''Wagner:''' You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
:::'''Wagner:''' Luckily for you, I do know a few spots, having been in the trade this long. Never had the time to check them out myself is all.
:::'''Wagner:''' Tell you what, I'll mark out the locations for you &mdash; just make sure you come to me when you need any forging done, got it? Give me your map...
:::'''Wagner:''' ...Right, done. Crystal Ore deposits all marked out for you. Don't make me regret telling you.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Wagner knows)
:::'''Wagner:''' Nope.
:::'''Wagner:''' Not if you've already exhausted the sources I told you about.
:::'''Wagner:''' If you're that desperate for more, I'm sorry but that's your problem. We can discuss it another time, but I'm busy right now.
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Wagner:''' There's nothing to be said. Dragon or no dragon, I'll be here.
::'''Wagner:''' As long as there's life in me, the fires of Wagner's smithy will not go out.
::'''Wagner:''' Smithing is not dependent on brute strength. You need the sweat on your brow from constant hard work, and perseverance stronger thhan the metals we forge!
::'''Wagner:''' The tempest is precisely the time to practice perseverance. If one were to be terrified at a little wind, then forging a respectable weapon is simply out of the question!
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask about something.
::'''Wagner:''' Well, spit it out already.
::{{DIcon}} How good is this smithy?
:::'''Wagner:''' Stupid question. If you really want to know, buy something.
:::'''Wagner:''' Talk is cheap. Pick up a blade and you'll soon know.
:::'''Wagner:''' If even this much eludes you, then you've got a long road ahead of you, runt.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself.
:::'''Wagner:''' There are no other qualified blacksmiths here, except for me and my apprentice, Schulz.
:::'''Wagner:''' I can tell you from experience that hard work is all there is to the craft! Many other "blacksmiths" out there are just out to make a quick mora!
:::'''Wagner:''' Family? Inheritance? Meaningless! I only need an apprentice to pass on my skills.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Wagner:''' If there's nothing else, get going. I'm busy.
