==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Wagner is the main blacksmith in Mondstadt. He created [[Noelle]]'s [[Favonius Greatsword|greatsword]].

While he is the owner of his blacksmith, the business name being Schulz's Blacksmith came when he had a bet with his apprentice, Schulz over who could drink the most. Wagner ended up losing and was forced to change the business name as a result. Sometime later, [[Lawrence]]'s father, a merchant from [[Fontaine]], had a drinking contest with Wagner. Not knowing about the infamy of the [[Lawrence Clan]] at the time, Lawrence's father would have to call his son Lawrence. Fortunately, Wagner was able to win; if he had lost, then he would have had to name his prized weapon "Pinky the Rabbit".<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Lawrence}}</ref>

===Personality===
Wagner does not have a friendly personality, which [[Paimon]] and his apprentice [[Schulz]] take note of, the latter considering him to be curt. He is blunt and direct, having no time for idle chatter and is always seen fulfilling his clients' orders regardless of the weather. He claims that other smiths are there to make quick [[Mora]], stating that he has no intention to give his blacksmith up to his family members, instead opting to pass his skills down to his apprentice.

Being the only blacksmith in Mondstadt, Wagner also takes immense pride in his skill and reputation. After he created various greatswords for Noelle to try, when she returned with them broken, he initially believed that she was unworthy of his swords, but quickly realized that she was far too strong for them, which was said to have nearly driven him into seclusion, but eventually created a sword she could use. While he is strict towards Schulz to ensure he will become a reputable blacksmith in the future, it is also implied he cares for him.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(During [[Dragon Storm]])
{{Transclude|Dragon Storm|Wagner|section=1}}

;(Normal dialogue)
:'''Wagner:''' Can I help you?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you have to sell?
::'''Wagner:''' Take your pick. You'll find no second-rate items at Wagner's.
:{{DIcon|Forging}} I'd like something made.
:;(If nothing has been forged)
:::'''Wagner:''' Did you bring the materials? Let me have a look.
:;(If something has been forged but not collected yet)
:::'''Wagner:''' That reminds me &mdash; your order from last time is ready. Is that what you wanted, or is this a new request?
:{{DIcon|!}} Any tips on finding ore in Mondstadt?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Wagner knows; Version 1)
:::'''Wagner:''' You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
:::'''Wagner:''' Luckily for you, I did in fact come across some odd-looking Crystal Ore recently. It's called Magical Crystal Ore and it's a lot more powerful than your regular one.
:::'''Wagner:''' I, for one, don't have the skill to deal with that kind of power. It could be that it takes more than the work of a smith to process that kind of thing.
:::'''Wagner:''' ...I've marked a few locations of Magical Crystal Ore on your map. Go fetch some and see what you make of it.
:::'''Wagner:''' You must let me know if you figure out how to make use of it... I can't stand being shown up as a blacksmith by a bunch of stupid rocks.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Wagner knows; Version 2)
:::'''Wagner:''' You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
:::'''Wagner:''' Luckily for you, I do know a few spots, having been in the trade this long. Never had the time to check them out myself is all.
:::'''Wagner:''' Tell you what, I'll mark out the locations for you &mdash; just make sure you come to me when you need any forging done, got it? Give me your map...
:::'''Wagner:''' ...Right, done. Crystal Ore deposits all marked out for you. Don't make me regret telling you.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Wagner knows)
:::'''Wagner:''' Nope.
:::'''Wagner:''' Not if you've already exhausted the sources I told you about.
:::'''Wagner:''' If you're that desperate for more, I'm sorry but that's your problem. We can discuss it another time, but I'm busy right now.
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Wagner:''' There's nothing to be said. Dragon or no dragon, I'll be here.
::'''Wagner:''' As long as there's life in me, the fires of Wagner's smithy will not go out.
::'''Wagner:''' Smithing is not dependent on brute strength. You need the sweat on your brow from constant hard work, and perseverance stronger thhan the metals we forge!
::'''Wagner:''' The tempest is precisely the time to practice perseverance. If one were to be terrified at a little wind, then forging a respectable weapon is simply out of the question!
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask about something.
::'''Wagner:''' Well, spit it out already.
::{{DIcon}} How good is this smithy?
:::'''Wagner:''' Stupid question. If you really want to know, buy something.
:::'''Wagner:''' Talk is cheap. Pick up a blade and you'll soon know.
:::'''Wagner:''' If even this much eludes you, then you've got a long road ahead of you, runt.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself.
:::'''Wagner:''' There are no other qualified blacksmiths here, except for me and my apprentice, Schulz.
:::'''Wagner:''' I can tell you from experience that hard work is all there is to the craft! Many other "blacksmiths" out there are just out to make a quick mora!
:::'''Wagner:''' Family? Inheritance? Meaningless! I only need an apprentice to pass on my skills.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Wagner:''' If there's nothing else, get going. I'm busy.
