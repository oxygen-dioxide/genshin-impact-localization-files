'''Realm Layouts''' are exterior maps in the [[Serenitea Pot]].

When players first gain access to the Serenitea Pot, they will obtain one Realm Layout of their choice, and additional Realm Layouts can be unlocked by gaining [[Trust]] with [[Tubby]] and through [[:Category:Realm Layout Unlock Materials|Realm Layout unlock materials]] granted from quests and exploration in Teyvat. Speaking to Tubby allows the player to switch between different Realm Layouts.

Only one Realm Layout can be active at a time. All [[Furnishing]]s used in inactive Realm Layouts are saved, including [[Gardening]] progress, which is paused. Furnishings in inactive Realm Layouts can be used again in the active Realm Layout.

[[Trust Rank]], [[Adeptal Mirror]] progress, [[Realm Currency]], contents of the [[Jar of Riches]], and weekly items sold by [[Chubby]] are the same between realms. [[Adeptal Energy]] and [[Load]] are not shared between realms because they are dependent on the currently placed furnishings; however, the maximum Adeptal Energy across all realms is used for determining the rate of Realm Currency accumulation in the Jar of Riches.

==List of Realm Layouts==
Obtaining a new Realm Layout will also give its associated [[Mansion]] as a furnishing item.

Each Realm Layout comes with four areas. The first area of the realm contains a [[Realm Layout#Realm Waypoint: A Place to Return To|Realm Waypoint: A Place to Return To]]. Increasing Trust Rank with Tubby is required to unlock the subsequent three areas.

==Realm Waypoint: A Place to Return To==
{{Description|This type of [[Sub-Space Waypoint|Teleport Waypoint]] created through Sub-Space Creation, can be used to travel back and forth between places in the Realm Within. As the number and types of furnishings within the Serenitea Pot increase and gain all measure of special traits, even one such as [[Tubby]] will find it difficult to manage every corner of the realm, and as such has set this highly-secure Realm Waypoint up. If you should encounter any situation that you cannot immediately deal with, you can use its power to quickly return to a safe position.|Description}}
One waypoint exists in the first area of every Realm Layout and cannot be moved or removed. Its location is marked with a special icon {{Icon|A Place to Return To Map}}.
