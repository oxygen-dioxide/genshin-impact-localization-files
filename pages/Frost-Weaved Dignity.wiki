{{Description|A cup carved out of ice that is as chilly and biting as winter. Its former master would drink an unfreezable liquor from it.}}
'''Frost-Weaved Dignity''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Blizzard Strayer]].

==Description==
For [[Imunlaukr|the outlander]] who once searched for hope in midwinter on [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|another]]'s behalf,<br>Even the glass he drank from was carved out of ice.

Drinking bitter wine in this glass would feel like swallowing icicles that stung every inch of one's throat.<br>Ordinary people would struggle to enjoy this sensation &mdash; but the reticent hero relished it.

He was a warrior as silent as the ice itself, blocking the frigid winds that descended from the stars with his body.<br>But not content with merely being protected, the maiden who painted left the man she admired these last instructions:

"If fear or despair, both of which are within our nature, should crush you, or cause you to never return, then..."<br>"...Then please, live on. Do not accompany [[Sal Vindagnyr|us]] unto our doom &mdash; to languish forgotten in the snow."

Taking another swig of bitter wine to steel himself for the journey, he turned away from the maiden's wet eyes,<br>And he would set out on an unending pursuit, towards the land of snow and profundity.
