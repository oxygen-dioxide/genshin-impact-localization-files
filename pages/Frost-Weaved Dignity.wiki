{{Description|A cup carved out of ice that is as chilly and biting as winter. Its former master would drink an unfreezable liquor from it.}}
'''Frost-Weaved Dignity''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Blizzard Strayer]].

==Description==
For the outlander who once searched for hope in midwinter on another's behalf,<br />Even the glass he drank from was carved out of ice.

Drinking bitter wine in this glass would feel like swallowing icicles that stung every inch of one's throat.<br />Ordinary people would struggle to enjoy this sensation — but the reticent hero relished it.

He was a warrior as silent as the ice itself, blocking the frigid winds that descended from the stars with his body.<br />But not content with merely being protected, the maiden who painted left the man she admired these last instructions:

"If fear or despair, both of which are within our nature, should crush you, or cause you to never return, then..."<br />"...Then please, live on. Do not accompany us unto our doom — to languish forgotten in the snow."

Taking another swig of bitter wine to steel himself for the journey, he turned away from the maiden's wet eyes,<br />And he would set out on an unending pursuit, towards the land of snow and profundity.
