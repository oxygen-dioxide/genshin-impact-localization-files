''On her neck, she wore a green bandana with dark-brown intricate linings. She also wore a visor cap on her head, accented with blue, white, yellow, brown, and orange. On the top of the visor is an orange emblem with a white triangle symbol. She wore beige sturdy muffin-like gloves, accented with dark-beige and a light-cyan lining. She is also a dark-brown underlayer that flares out slightly at the ends, like ruffles. At the center of the gloves is an orange gem emblem.''

Her outfit consists of a dark-brown seemingly cropped top, with a white layer over it with shoppy zigzag ends. The white layer has light-green linings. At the bottom, she wore puffy dark-brown shorts, with an orange thick jacket tied to her waistline. Her footwear consists of dark-brown tant boots, similar to that of a dog's paw, lined and accented with light-green and white. It also has wing-like accessories at the ankles.
