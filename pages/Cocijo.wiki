'''Cocijo''' is a [[Local Legend]] found south of the [[Statue of The Seven]] in [[Ameyalco Waters]], [[Natlan]].

In order to spawn Cocijo for the first time, the player must head to his arena and destroy all of the [[Electro Crystal]]s in the area. He will spawn when the last of the crystals are destroyed, and this does not need to be done again for subsequent spawns.

Once defeated, Cocijo takes 12 real-life hours to respawn.

|name_4      = Enhancement
|desc_4      = Upon taking DMG (except DMG from [[Burning]]), Cocijo accumulates '''3%''' of [[Fury]]. Once Fury reaches max, Cocijo will gain a Thunderthorn Shield. While the shield is active, Cocijo gains enhanced attacks and immunity to DMG, and if the on-field character attacks it while nearby, it will counterattack, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. This however, does not apply to DMG dealt by off-field characters, or when the player is standing sufficiently far away. Repeated counterattack hits have their DMG is reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]]. Once the shield is destroyed, Cocijo loses its enhancement and becomes paralyzed.
