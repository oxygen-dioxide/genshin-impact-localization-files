{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Collingwood in Dreamscape)
:'''Collingwood:''' Hey there! Are you the one who's assisting me with the Dreamscape Therapy? To be honest, I don't know what my dream's going to be about.
:'''Collingwood:''' I'm from [[Mondstadt]], and I don't really have any hobbies... You know, except drinking.
:'''Collingwood:''' And I'm the type to mess up sometimes when I get sloshed, so... I'm counting on you.

;(Talk to Collingwood in Dreamscape again, optional)
:'''Collingwood:''' The more I look at this tavern, the stranger it seems. Urgh... It... seems like some things are just different from normal, like they're crooked?

;(After some time passes without finding an item)
:'''Collingwood:''' Ha, I'm still nice and sober. I noticed it immediately, the barkeep set the {{Color|help|chairs and ornaments}} upside down. Hey, barkeep? Fix 'em, would you?

;(After finding 3 inverted items)
:'''Collingwood:''' Ahh, that's much easier on the eyes! But there's still a few that are upside down. Yep. That's uncomfortable.

;(After fixing the dream)
:{|class="wikitable"

|That's more like it! Sure was a mess, but at least it's better now. Ha, what would the [[Angel's Share]] be without me?

:'''Youguang:''' I'm Youguang, a guard from [[Liyue]]. I touched something... unclean while at work recently, and I haven't had a good night's sleep since. That's why I sought help.
:'''Youguang:''' If I can dispel my nightmares through this Dreamscape Therapy, that would truly be amazing.

;(Talk to Youguang in Dreamscape again, optional)
:'''Youguang:''' O demons, great divine beings, and honored adepti, please, shower us with your mercy! Do not hide in objects, please, show yourselves, before I die of fright!

;(After some time pass without finding an item)
:'''Youguang:''' Ah! Adepti, [[Lord of Geo]], please, deliver me from danger! Who can open all these {{Color|help|floating things}}, surely there must be ghosts hiding within!

;(After finding 4 floating items)
:'''Youguang:''' The number of demons hiding has plummeted! However, I can still feel a sinister presence. There must still be a few hiding somewhere that have yet to show themselves.

;(After fixing the dream)
:{|class="wikitable"

|This must be a blessing from some illuminated being! Thank you all for having mercy on a lowly guard such as myself! I'll be leaving for my next job now.

;(Talk to Piyush in Dreamscape)
:'''Piyush:''' So you're the fine friend that Dharmakirti's introduced? Piyush, pleased to meet you. I work in architecture.
:'''Piyush:''' I've heard [[Kaveh]] mention your name before, but I haven't had the chance to say hello yet, so this is a happy coincidence.
:'''Piyush:''' I'm guessing I'll dream about a project I just submitted. It was an absolute nightmare... It's just a shame we have to first meet in such a formal fashion... Oh well.

;(Talk to Piyush in Dreamscape again, optional)
:'''Piyush:''' Everything must be arranged in some order. That's just one of my principles of design.
:'''Piyush:''' All inhuman, asymmetrical architectural designs must be destroyed! Destroyed. With. Prejudice!

:'''Piyush:''' :'''Piyush:''' I can't take it anymore! Why didn't you follow the design!? Pavilions, pools, fountains, greenhouses... The slopes, and even the greenhouse interiors, not one has spared a thought for symmetry!

;(After some more time passes without finding an asymmetrical object)<!--second hint-->
:'''Piyush:''' Be sure to thoroughly double-check the area after everything's all set up! All the lights, benches, and street lamps must be {{Color|help|placed with central symmetry}}, got that?

;(After finding 4 asymmetrical objects)
:'''Piyush:''' Excellent, the whole space looks far more harmonious now. A few more adjustments and it'll finally be perfect.
