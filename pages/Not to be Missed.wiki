{{Quest Description|The storm has subsided, but [[Cyrus]] seems displeased...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Cyrus)
:'''Cyrus:''' The storms suddenly stopped...
:{{DIcon}} Is that a bad thing?
:'''Cyrus:''' Ah, no... It's good that they stopped, yes.
:'''Cyrus:''' Hmm... But it's all too sudden. I came up with so many contingency plans. Are we not going to get the chance to any of them?
:'''Cyrus:''' My contingencies included ways to scatter the people in the wild to avoid the storms, teach them how to survive...
:'''Cyrus:''' ...We were going to teach them to set up basic camps, do pest control, avoid beasts and monsters...
:'''Cyrus:''' Ah, never mind. Rather than take our chances out there, better to remain safe within these walls.
:'''Cyrus:''' Ah, yes. Some of our investigating adventurers have informed me that there are monsters congregating in the [[Whispering Woods]].
:'''Cyrus:''' Almost everyone is out investigating, and I must remain here to command them.
:'''Cyrus:''' Traveler, can I count on you to clear those monsters out?
:{{DIcon}} Consider it done.
::'''Cyrus:''' I'll leave it to you, then. Don't worry, you will be compensated fairly!
:{{DIcon}} You seem unhappy about this.
::'''Cyrus:''' Ah, this... Well, you know how the young people in Mondstadt all wish to join the Knights of Favonius, with their shining armor, their flying banners, the glory, and Master [[Jean]] as well...
::'''Cyrus:''' As for the Adventurers' Guild, the only impression of us people have is that of people who bumble about outdoors... Basically, no one cares about us.
::'''Cyrus:''' I thought to myself that if there was an opportunity to show the Guild's mettle, we might be able to bring in more fresh blood.
::'''Cyrus:''' Ah, but it doesn't matter. The safety of Mondstadt is more important than my own personal wishes.
::'''Cyrus:''' I'll leave those monsters to you. I'll have your compensation ready.
:{{DIcon}} I've got other matters...
::'''Cyrus:''' Alright. Go get your affairs in order first. I'll think of a way to get someone to clear those monsters out.
::'''Cyrus:''' *sigh* Where has that kid [[Bennett]] run off to? I hope he didn't run into any trouble.
:;(Does not accept the quest)

;(Talk to Cyrus again)
:'''Cyrus:''' *sigh* Where has that kid Bennett run off to? I hope he didn't run into any trouble.
----
;(Approach the first location)
:'''Paimon:''' Look at all those barrels of Pyro Slime! Only those monsters would dare to do something so dangerous. Let's help them clear these away, shall we?
:;(Approach the second location)
:'''Paimon:''' Look at this tower... Are the monsters preparing to build a camp here?
:;(Approach the third location)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon's got a bad feeling about this bonfire. Wonder what they could be using it for?
:;(After defeating all the enemies)
:'''Paimon:''' There's still so many monsters... Seems we've only seen the beginning of them...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go tell Cyrus about what we've seen here.
----
;(Talk to Cyrus)
:'''Cyrus:''' You're back. What's the situation?
:{{DIcon}} There are still monsters out and about...
:'''Cyrus:''' Monsters are still in the area, eh? So it seems that the effects of the Storm have yet to disperse...
:'''Cyrus:''' Hahaha! So there's still time, then – time for the Adventurers' Guild to show its quality.
:'''Cyrus:''' It is up to us to take those monsters out in the wild on, while the Knights of Favonius are still focused on defending the city and the area around Mondstadt.
:'''Cyrus:''' I understand. Thanks for your help investigating. I will reconsider the commissions that we will be sending out. Take these as your reward.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* During the quest, Cyrus will be present at the Adventurers' Guild headquarters and the Angel's Share tavern at the same time, regardless if it daytime or nighttime.
** At Angel's Share, he will stand instead of being seated on the table.
** Only the line "''*sigh* Where has that kid [[Bennett]] run off to? I hope he didn't run into any trouble''" is available when the player interacts with him, although his daytime and nighttime idle quotes do not change.
