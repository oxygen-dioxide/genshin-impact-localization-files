{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Offer the first Blazing Flint Ore)
:'''Throne of the Primal Fire:''' "The first flint lights up the distant past, and the land of journey's beginning &mdash; we call it home. The way back may be no more; yet when you and I embrace the night, pure as a mirror it remains, and forever shall it stay."

;(Offer the second Blazing Flint Ore)
:'''Throne of the Primal Fire:''' "The second flint lights up the juncture of setting forth, and the day the journey began &mdash; we call it farewell. In its departure, the unchanging world betrays us; yet still some try to grasp its shadow."

;(Offer the third Blazing Flint Ore)
:'''Throne of the Primal Fire:''' "The third flint lights up a daytime of celebration, and a moment when hearts are opened up &mdash; we call it friendship. This journey is far from a solitary trial; not only the winds, but human hearts too, embrace us along the way."

;(Offer the fourth Blazing Flint Ore)
:'''Throne of the Primal Fire:''' "The fourth flint lights up a tempestuous night of rain-soaked despair, and a sea of anguishing descent &mdash; we call it failure. Fighting against the rising tide, a little boat is very nearly submerged; yet thankfully, it cannot prize the oars from our hands."

;(Offer the fifth Blazing Flint Ore)
:'''Throne of the Primal Fire:''' "The fifth flint lights up those days of pushing onward, and the stones with which tall towers are built &mdash; we call it determination. Higher we climb, higher and higher; until at last, we glimpse the destination we have long dreamed of."

;(Offer the sixth Blazing Flint Ore)
:'''Throne of the Primal Fire:''' "The sixth flint lights up the moment of arrival, and the seats upon which we may evermore rest &mdash; we call it a miracle. Together, we have brought this journey to its conclusion; yet instead of an ending, let us see this as a new beginning."
