==Profile==
When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] seek out the [[adeptus]] [[Mountain Shaper]], they encounter Li Ding, who reveals that he and Li Dang came to [[Jueyun Karst]] in search of the treasures. Li Dang, however, was trapped in an amber prison and Li Ding implores the Traveler to save him. After they do so, the two vow to renounce their treasure-hoarding ways and leave.

They also appear in [[Hu Tao]]'s character demo trailer, "Hu Tao: Let the Living Beware." In it, they obtained a treasure map from [[Bao'er]] for hidden treasure in [[Wuwang Hill]]. Hu Tao, who was in the area to perform funeral rites, plays pranks on them before defeating them in battle and sending them running. It is unknown when this occurs relative to the Archon Quests.
