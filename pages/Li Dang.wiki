'''Li Dang''' {{Lang|zh=李当|zh_rm=Lǐ Dāng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Moulder of Mountains}}.

==Profile==
When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] seek out the [[adeptus]] [[Mountain Shaper]], they are implored by [[Li Ding]] to save his brother Li Dang, who was trapped in an [[Amber Rock|amber prison]]. After Li Dang is saved, the two brothers vow to renounce their treasure-hoarding ways and leave.

During [[Hu Tao]]'s [[Character Demo]] "Hu Tao: Let the Living Beware," they are looking for hidden treasure in [[Wuwang Hill]]. Hu Tao, who was in the area to perform funeral rites, plays pranks on them before defeating them in battle and sending them running. It is unknown when this occurs relative to the Archon Quests.

===Appearance===
Li has brown hair and wears a dark shirt with black boots.
