====Adeptus's Notes====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Adeptus's Notes (I):''' "...The branch she planted keeps growing. It seems the water and soil in the cave are quite nutritious... Maybe in a few years, once it grows a little bigger, that medicine jar will be too small for this young tree..."
:'''Adeptus's Notes (I):''' "...She connected the door-opening mechanism with the jar the branch is planted in, breathing life-giving adeptal energy into said mechanism..."
:'''Adeptus's Notes (I):''' "...It seems the jar containing the mechanism was damaged a long time ago. I wonder if the door can still open and close..."
{{Dialogue End}}

====Ancient Notes====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ancient Notes:''' (The content is blurry and only a few incomplete sentences written in elegant handwriting are legible...)
:'''Ancient Notes:''' "As the vivid butterflies converge in the jar, the adeptal energy surges anew, akin to new life restored to a withered tree..."
:'''Ancient Notes:''' "Go west and behold {{Color|buzzword|[[Lingshu Courtyard]]}}, and..."
{{Dialogue End}}

====Ancient Text (I)====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ancient Text (I):''' "...They say fish have a bad memory, and I'm starting to wonder if [[Fujin|she]] is one. She won't stop telling me about that '[[Votive Rainjade|Motive Mainjade]]' business..."
:'''Ancient Text (I):''' "...Even though it always fills me with the urge to interrupt her, seeing that look of joy on her face makes me decide against it... If anything, efficiency takes a hit when she isn't here to natter away..."
:'''Ancient Text (I):''' "...I must keep this locked up. I can never let any person or fish see this. She might start jumping for joy otherwise..."
{{Dialogue End}}

====Ancient Text (II)====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ancient Text (II):''' "...Why come crying to me? 'Please make me some slimming tea'... Hmph! Wild beasts never change, I see! Don't you know that a human form created by adeptal energy can never gain weight...?"
:'''Ancient Text (II):''' "...And that fish, going along with the whole affair and begging me with a smile despite knowing the truth full well..."
:'''Ancient Text (II):''' "...I agreed. I'll just make it. Who knows? One day, it may be useful for the mortals..."
{{Dialogue End}}

====Ancient Text (III)====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ancient Text (III):''' "...I spoke to the master about certain matters. I have a bad feeling, although they are usually wrong. This kind of thing should be Fujin's specialty..."
:'''Ancient Text (III):''' "...Still, I should take some precautions... I'll split some adeptal energy off and inject it into the butterflies... Their lifespan will extend greatly..."
:'''Ancient Text (III):''' "...Then, even if something were to happen, the mortals of Chenyu Vale may be able to follow their guidance and find the formulae I left behind..."
