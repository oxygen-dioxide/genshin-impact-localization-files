{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Bluffy:''' Ah, yes, hello. Do you need something?
:'''Bluffy:''' Oh, right, I'm still on the clock... Apologies, what might you require, dear guest?
:{{DIcon}} What's on your mind?
:'''Bluffy:''' I was just spacing out for a moment. Thank you for your concern.
:'''Bluffy:''' Honestly, I have another reason for doing this job... I'm looking for one of those meetings you read about in books &mdash; a romantic coincidence.
:'''Bluffy:''' A homely maid suddenly whisked off her feet by a dashing young rogue, making a secret promise by the [[Bishui River]]... Ahh...
:'''Bluffy:''' Perhaps it's the slow business here, or it's just my luck, but it seems that such things could never happen to me.
:'''Bluffy:''' *sigh* I was wondering if I should give up and find someone familiar to settle down with. I can't just keep waiting like this forever...
:{{DIcon}} Good Luck. See you.
:'''Bluffy:''' You too. If there's anything else you need, please feel free to ask.
