'''The Shogun''' is an artificial body made by [[Ei]] to act as her current vessel. She is playable as the body of the [[Raiden Shogun]].

==Profile==
The Shogun was made through an unknown process. She has a consciousness of her own, as stated by [[Ei]] in [[Farewell to the Past]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell to the Past|quote='''Ei:''' Though she is a puppet, the Shogun has her own consciousness, too. When necessary, she appears here to confront me.}}</ref> She was given a highly durable body and immense willpower so that she could resist the effects of [[erosion]]. She is connected to the storms of [[Inazuma]],<ref name="Ei dialogue TLE">{{Ref/Quest|The Lonesome Euthymia}}</ref> and wields the [[Musou Isshin|sword]] (Musou Isshin) that houses Ei in battle. The Shogun was created with a set list of rules that cannot be altered or shut off.<ref name="Ei dialogue TLE" />

During Ei's Story Quest, [[Transient Dreams]], the Shogun believes that Ei is succumbing to erosion and tries to stop her by refusing to comply with her orders. Ei, realizing the Shogun is responsible for stopping the body from moving, challenges her inside Makoto's consciousness to prove that she has not been corrupted. As a result of [[Istaroth|temporal disruption]] in the realm, as well as the Shogun's unbreakable synthetic will, the two dueled continually for five centuries uninterrupted. Due to her new perspectives, Ei is able to defeat the Shogun, who concedes defeat and agrees to serve as her kagemusha.

===Personality===
The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation. The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant, and does exactly as she wishes in maintaining the eternity that Ei envisioned when she created the Shogun. Following Ei's defeat by the [[Traveler]], she appeared to show some doubts over her creator's changed views<ref>{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|5}}</ref> before openly defying her to maintain the old notions of eternity,<ref>Video: [[:File:Version 2.5 Special Program｜Genshin Impact|Version 2.5 Special Program]]</ref> although she has since reconciled with her creator.

Due to being what Ei perceived as perfection and indifference at the time of her creation, the Shogun can be easily manipulated by outside forces, such as the [[Kujou Clan]] and the [[Fatui]] manipulating her to issue the [[Vision Hunt Decree]].
