'''Unknown Star''' is the first of three event phases in the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event, and is unlocked after completing the Event Quest ''[[Unknown Star]]''.

In this phase, small meteorites can be found scattered across Teyvat. The citizens who venture too close to the meteorites fall asleep.

==Quests==
This act is unlocked by completing the main quest ''[[Unknown Star]]''. Afterward, there are three optional quests that you can complete for rewards:
*[[That Which Fell From the Sky]]
*[[To Each Their Duty]]
*[[Thoughts Carried On the Wind]]

==Tutorial==
[[File:Tutorial Unknown_Star 1.png|200px|thumb|left]]From the map, you can view the impact sites where meteorite shards are present. When you reach the affected area, the mini-map will show the approximate locations of individual meteorite shards.

[[File:Tutorial Unknown_Star 2.png|200px|thumb|left]]Within the meteorite shards flows a certain energy, which will resonate with a nearby character's Vision, causing both to light up and flash. The closer you draw to a shard, the more intense the flashing will become. Make good use of this phenomenon to effortlessly track down and salvage meteorite shards.

==Locations==
Currently, there are 6 locations that the meteorites have landed. Meteorite locations are fixed, and will not vary from player to player.

==Incident Report==
[[File:Act_Unknown_Star_Ending.png|300px|left]]
After disposing of the meteorite shards with the help of the Prinzessin, the sleepers' situation seems to have improved. The people are sincerely grateful and offer you their very best wishes. Just as well, because you're going to need all the best wishes you can get &mdash; this is far from the final stop on your journey.
{{clr}}

==Notes==
*Characters without a Vision ([[Venti]] and [[Traveler]]) will not have a visual indicator.
*NPC enemies that are spawned because of the meteorite shards will not grant character experience nor drop loot.
