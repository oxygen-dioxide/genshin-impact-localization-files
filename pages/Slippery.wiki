==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Slippery:''' Hey there! Hey, traveler!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Slippery:''' I used to work here in the mines, but after they dried up a few years ago everybody moved on.
::'''Slippery:''' The other day I suddenly remembered that I'd left some valuables in my old place and forgotten to collect them... But now it seems the valley is overrun by monsters... *sigh*
::{{DIcon}} I can help.
::'''Slippery:''' Why, thank you! You've got a courageous heart and a noble soul, you have.
::'''Slippery:''' Oh, just one thing. Small thing. Since it came up and all. If you do happen to find any treasure down there in the valley, do let me know... I'll be happy to split it with you seventy-thirty... Nah forget that, let's do fifty-fifty!
::{{DIcon}} Treasure?
::'''Slippery:''' This mine's been left abandoned like this for years, and it's crawling with monsters too. Who knows what kind of treasure might still be hanging around in there?
::'''Slippery:''' If you are lucky enough to come across anything, you'll be able to make an absolute fortune from it!
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Slippery:''' This is Yaoguang Shoal. Used to be the biggest mining facility in Liyue.
::'''Slippery:''' But they mined it to exhaustion. It's just a hole in the ground now.
::'''Slippery:''' That's why all the towns around here are deserted, too.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Slippery:''' Bye-bye!
