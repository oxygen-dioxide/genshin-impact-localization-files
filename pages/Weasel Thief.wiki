'''Weasel Thieves''', colloquially referred to as ''Mora Weasels'', will appear randomly across the world. They will run away from you once they spot you, burrowing and hiding into a hole. When they burrow they will drop 500, 750 or 1000 Mora - this way they can be farmed without killing every day.

Once they burrow, you can investigate this hideout, causing the Weasel Thief to escape. As it runs, it will drop a stream of 1 [[Mora]].

Travelers can hit this curious animal once you have driven them out of their burrow in order to receive additional 500, 750, or 1000 [[Mora]], however this will cause them to no longer respawn. The amount of Mora corresponds to the type of Weasel Thief, which each have a characteristic glow and a different purse.

Before burrowing weasels are impervious to damage. However once player drives them out of their hole - they become susceptible to both player damage and environmental damage - such as lightning during storm or burning grass. So it might be wise to not interact with their hiding place at all if player doesn't want to risk getting them killed.

==Trivia==
* The fact that they do not drop [[Raw Meat]] may imply that the character only removes their purse when attacking them, leaving the critter to escape.
