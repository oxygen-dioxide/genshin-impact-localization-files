'''Roald''', most commonly known as '''Roald the Adventurer''', is a famous adventurer whose skill and determination is only outclassed by his ability to consistently lose his diary.

He is the author of [[Diary of Roald the Adventurer]], a series of diaries located primarily across [[Liyue]] that the [[Traveler]] can find after he lost them.

==Profile==
Roald is a famous adventurer who travels around Teyvat. At some point prior to the Traveler's arrival, he had just finished up exploring Liyue and made his way to [[Inazuma]]. However, he severely underestimated the severity of the situation at the time and was forced to rely on [[Sumida]] and [[Kama]] to get across Inazuma as he lacked the permits. Roald eventually became aware of the Traveler's reputation during his travels.

Roald would eventually be commissioned by Sumida to obtain a [[Maushiro]] and met [[Ruu]] on [[Tsurumi Island]]. However, he did not know the true extent of the situation of the island and when he returned to bring the Maushiro back, it had disappeared. After meeting the Traveler, he returned to Tsurumi Island and asked the Traveler to bring him some [[Fluorescent Fungus]] and take photos of murals on the island. After returning with them, Roald thanked them and departed from the island, only to unknowingly drop his most recent diary in the process.

===Personality===
Roald is knowledgeable in the history of the areas he visits and appears to be quite keen on putting together context clues from his environment. For example, he correctly deduces that a chase and possibly a murder occurred in [[Dragonspine]] during the time of [[Mondstadt Aristocracy|Mondstadt's aristocratic period]], based on the distribution of items and the relatively newer condition of the items compared to the ruins of [[Sal Vindagnyr]]. He witnessed the remains of [[Eberhart]]'s conspiracy against and murder of the aristocracy's expedition team, which included his half-brother [[Ingbert]].

Roald is also largely accurate in his rendition of [[Havria]]'s death and the subsequent destruction of [[Sal Terrae]]. In comparison, [[Wanyan]], a descendant of Sal Terrae survivors, only knew a corrupted version of the tale in which [[Morax]] was depicted as an assassin who slew the God of Salt out of jealousy.

Despite all of his knowledge, Roald is prone to forgetting frequently and often has to write down his findings in his diary so he could remember what he found and was doing, although his forgetful nature means that he ends up losing them in the process.

==Story==
Before traveling to Liyue, Roald apparently explored Dragonspine. However, its inhospitable climate eventually got the better of him, causing him to flee to [[Sal Terrae]].<ref name="vol 9">{{Ref/Book|Diary of Roald the Adventurer|9|Dragonspine}}</ref>

After leaving Dragonspine, he traveled to Sal Terrae, Qingce Village, Mt. Aocang, Luhua Pool, Yaoguang Shoal, Guyun Stone Forest, and Qingyun Peak, in that order. He also visited Qingxu Pool, but it is not clear when he arrived there relative to his arrival at his other destinations.

Roald traveled to [[Inazuma]] while the [[Sakoku Decree]] was in effect, but underestimated the severity of the situation before he arrived. He planned to leave [[Ritou]] after hearing that the [[The Crux]] was stopping by briefly.<ref name="vol 10">{{Ref/Book|Diary of Roald the Adventurer|10|Ritou}}</ref>

He was then approached by [[Sumida]] and commissioned to go to [[Tsurumi Island]] to gather reference material and look for a [[Maushiro]], despite the fact that he doesn't have a permit to travel around Inazuma. Like many others commissioned before him, he comes back convinced he had the Maushiro and forgetting most of his travels on Tsurumi Island. He is then called back by Sumida together with the [[Bantan Sango Detective Agency]] and meets the [[Traveler]] for the first time.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Octave of the Maushiro}}</ref>
