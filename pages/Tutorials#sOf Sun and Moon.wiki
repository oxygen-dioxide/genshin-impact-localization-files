|text1    = If you possess the Golden Bridle of Enkanomiya, you will have the authority to activate mechanisms that switch between Evernight and Whitenight. Such mechanisms, which can be found throughout Enkanomiya, are connected to the Dainichi Mikoshi and can be used to modify the day-nightcycle.<br />Enkanomiya appears different in the Evernight and Whitenight states. Use this ability to switch between day and night well in order to uncover the land's secrets.
