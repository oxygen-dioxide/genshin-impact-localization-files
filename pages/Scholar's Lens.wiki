'''Scholar's Lens''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Scholar]].

==Description==
The pursuit of knowledge is a risky gamble. Even after devoting one's entire life to it, it may prove to have been futile.<br>The scholar spent half of her lifetime in endless research, taking notes and making calculations.<br>Having failed to find the answers she was looking for, she once hesitated and questioned her career choice, thus wasting further time.<br>Her once sharp eyesight had also been damaged by intensive reading.<br>All this, and the answers she sought were still beyond her reach.
