{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing [[The Exile: Blooming]])
:'''Sabbah:''' Here for a chat? I've been wanting to talk to somebody.
:{{DIcon}} This is a [[Sumeru Rose]] that I picked.
:;(If this option has not been selected)
:;(Submit Sumeru Rose ×1)
::'''Sabbah:''' How I miss this sight... Here, your presents are ready too. Please, take them.
::'''Sabbah:''' They're all seeds of plants that won't grow here. If you have a yard somewhere else, you can watch them mature there.
:;(Obtain [[Harra Fruit Seed]] ×3, [[Zaytun Peach Seed]] ×3 and [[Sumeru Rose Seed]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Which Darshan were you with, by the way?
::'''Sabbah:''' Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!
::'''Sabbah:''' I was with [[Amurta]] and specialized in plant evolution, so you could say my work was evidence-based.
::'''Sabbah:''' That means it is impossible to reach new conclusions without new forms of evidence. Simply put, fossils are necessary for the study of historical plants.
::'''Sabbah:''' But there are only so many fossil samples available, and the Akademiya is limited in its ability to provide new ones.
::'''Sabbah:''' Those were the circumstances, yet the institute still demanded results.
::'''Sabbah:''' So some people would just take a previous study, revise or add something to it, and turn it in. You also find that quite pointless, right?
::'''Sabbah:''' In truth, we could make new discoveries for sure if we looked towards history and geography for new materials.
::'''Sabbah:''' Certain literary documents that Amurta would usually ignore could be used as well, though that would surely cross into [[Vahumana]] and [[Haravatat]] territory.
::'''Sabbah:''' I was not proficient in those fields, and requesting the related files was too troublesome, never mind working with their researchers...
::'''Sabbah:''' But I believe that if we could actually work together as a team, many questions of the past would finally be answered.
::'''Sabbah:''' It's a shame that we couldn't continue our collaboration attempts. I must say that people in Vahumana and Haravatat have very peculiar perspectives, though...
::'''Sabbah:''' I had to be very careful with my wording and phrasing in my submissions to them to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
::'''Sabbah:''' Before I was kicked out of the Akademiya, I was still in the middle of an argument with someone from Haravatat. Now I can't even do that...
:{{DIcon}} How's life in Aaru Village?
::'''Sabbah:''' It's alright. I have food and a roof over my head. All the essential things in life are taken care of.
::'''Sabbah:''' I was banished, after all, so I can't dream of having books and research instruments here.
::'''Sabbah:''' This place has been used as exiled scholars' banishing grounds for quite a while. Life is hard and practical here, so naturally, no one here is interested in academics or research.
::'''Sabbah:''' I'm certainly not the first exile, and probably won't be the last.
::'''Sabbah:''' All I can do is to learn to live with it.
:'''Sabbah:''' Ah, I just rambled for a long time... But it feels good.
:'''Sabbah:''' Before you got here, I really didn't have many friends, and it could get pretty lonely.
:'''Sabbah:''' Very few people in the village are into gardening.
:'''Sabbah:''' ...Well, that's not entirely true. An [[Affan|old man]] living to the north of the village also plowed a plot to grow flowers.
:'''Sabbah:''' I've visited him before. He's a slightly eccentric old man.
:'''Sabbah:''' I saw him planting stones, but he insisted that they were flowers, and even kicked me out.
:'''Sabbah:''' It must be lonely, living all by himself. I can understand that.
:'''Sabbah:''' You helped me with my Sumeru Roses... Maybe you can help him with his plants too.
:'''Sabbah:''' You and Paimon should visit him if you get a chance.
----
;(After completing A Gifted Rose)
:'''Sabbah:''' The Sumeru Roses we planted and the Golden Roses in Affan's nursery have both been growing nicely. Thank you so very much.
:{{DIcon}} Which Darshan were you in, by the way?
::'''Sabbah:''' Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!
::'''Sabbah:''' I was with Amurta and specialized in plant evolution, so you could say my work was evidence-based.
::'''Sabbah:''' That means that it is impossible to reach new conclusions without new material. Simply put, historical samples are necessary to examine historical plants.
::'''Sabbah:''' But there are only so many fossil samples available, and the Akademiya is limited in its ability to provide new ones.
::'''Sabbah:''' Those were the circumstances, yet the institute still demanded results.
::'''Sabbah:''' So some people would just take a previous study, revise or add something to it, and turn it in. You also find that quite pointless, right?
::{{DIcon}} ...
::'''Sabbah:''' In truth, we could make new discoveries for sure if we looked towards history and geography for new materials.
::'''Sabbah:''' Certain literary documents that Amurta would usually ignore could be used as well, though that would surely cross into Vahumana and Haravatat territory.
::'''Sabbah:''' I was not proficient in those fields, and requesting the related files was troublesome, never mind working with their researchers...

:{{DIcon}} How's life in Aaru Village?
::'''Sabbah:''' Oh, I've been doing alright. Thanks for your concern.
::'''Sabbah:''' The neighbors have been very kind to me, and Affan swings around to chat often, so... I'm definitely a lot less lonely than I was before.
::'''Sabbah:''' Though I fear that I can't just get books or research equipment whenever I want, I believe that as long as I desire to seek knowledge, I shall find it, no matter where I am.
:{{DIcon}} Have a great day.
::'''Sabbah:''' You too. Safe travels.
