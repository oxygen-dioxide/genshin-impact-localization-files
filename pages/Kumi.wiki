==Profile==
Kumi was originally a resident of [[Narukami Island]], but moved to [[Bourou Village]] at an unknown point in time. Her father was from Narukami, while her mother was from Watatsumi. When Kumi was young, she befriended an [[Umibouzu]] that she named [[Kuntira]]. They bonded over each other's loneliness, with Kuntira possibly being the last of her kind, and Kumi feeling out-of-place no matter which island she lived on. At some point during the Inazuman civil war, she traveled to [[Watatsumi Island]] to visit Kuntira, only to find the creature's remains washed ashore on the beach. She then fell into a bout of depression.

One day, the [[Traveler]] encountered Kumi near Kuntira's skeleton and offered their help. She requested some [[Sakura Bloom]]s to place as an offering for her friend. After they gave her the flowers, she asked them to check on a researcher named [[Anisa]], who had passed through the area the other day and was heading near [[hilichurl]] territory.

After rescuing Anisa from the hilichurls, the Traveler brought Anisa back to Kumi and the skeleton. Though Kumi believed that Kuntira had been alone her whole life, Anisa noted that Kuntira's pelvic bones were deformed, indicating that she had given birth numerous times. Additionally, based on the shape of her spine, Kuntira had passed away in the sea before washing ashore. Anisa speculated that Kuntira was near the shore during her final hours as a way of telling Kumi that she'd lived a happy and fulfilling life. Kumi, relieved by this information, decided that she would also try to live well.

The two bonded, and Anisa informed Kumi that she was planning to stay long-term on Watatsumi Island, to try befriend Kuntira's children. Kumi offered Anisa a room at her place in Bourou Village, which the researcher gratefully accepted.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kumi:''' Oh, it's you. Welcome.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been recently?
::'''Kumi:''' Thanks for your concern. I've been doing quite well.
::'''Kumi:''' Originally, I'd only intended to say goodbye to [[Kuntira]] and make peace with some parts of my life.
::'''Kumi:''' But now, I feel like this place is more like my home than Narukami Island... And I can experience new joys here that are more than just memories.
::'''Kumi:''' So I feel that continuing to live here isn't bad either.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'm glad that we met.
:::'''Kumi:''' I feel the same way. Thank you for your help previously.
:::'''Kumi:''' Oh, by the way... [[Anisa]]'s been trying really hard to get used to life around here. Lately, she's been learning how to make our local cuisine from me.
:::'''Kumi:''' It's just that she's, uh, made some changes to it based on flavors from [[Sumeru]]... I hope you don't mind.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Suspicious Omelette Rice|20|x=1}})
::{{DIcon}} About Anisa...
:::'''Kumi:''' She's... still as reckless as ever...
:::'''Kumi:''' She doesn't seem to act like she's in a different nation at all. She just keeps going to strange and dangerous places every day...
:::'''Kumi:''' And once she gets into her studies, that's the whole day she'll be spending on research I can't make heads or tails out of...
:::'''Kumi:''' She honestly worries me a bit.
:::'''Kumi:''' But she's also very considerate, and her voice is quite lovely. I think I can bear with it, I guess...
:::'''Kumi:''' Um, don't misunderstand, please. She's a good person, so it's not as if I dislike her or something...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kumi:''' Bye. I hope that everything goes well with you.
