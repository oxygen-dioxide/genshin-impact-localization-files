==Profile==
Kumi is a resident of [[Narukami Island]] and befriended an [[Umibouzu]] that was called [[Kuntira]]. At some point during the war against the Shogunate and Watatsumi forces, she traveled to [[Watatsumi Island]] to visit Kuntira, only to find her remains washed ashore on the beach and fell into a bout of depression.

The [[Traveler]] soon encountered Kumi and she told them a bit about her past with Kuntira, before requesting some [[Sakura Bloom]]s. After they gave her the flowers, she asked them to check on a researcher named [[Anisa]], who had wandered into [[hilichurls|hilichurl]] territory. The Traveler found Anisa held captive by hilichurls and freed her, solving a puzzle before bringing her back to the creature. Anisa then noted that Kuntira's pelvic bones were deformed, indicating that she had given birth numerous times and had died in sea before washing ashore on Watatsumi Island based on the shape of her spine. Kumi then offered Anisa lodging for as long as she needed on the island, relieved that Kuntira had lived a happy life.

===Personality===
Kumi admired Kuntira due to the two spending time together, believing themselves to be solitary. When Kuntira died, Kumi was saddened by her friend's death, assuming that she had suffered in her final moments and fell into a bout of depression. She appears to have feelings for Anisa given her unusual concern and mannerisms towards her. After Anisa explained that Kuntira had lived a fulfilling life from deductions based on her remains, Kumi became more optimistic and hoped to see Kuntira's children in the future.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kumi''': Oh, it's you. Welcome.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been recently?
::'''Kumi''': Thanks for your concern. I've been doing quite well.
::'''Kumi''': Originally, I'd only intended to say goodbye to [[Kuntira]] and make peace with some parts of my life.
::'''Kumi''': But now, I feel like this place is more like my home than Narukami Island... And I can experience new joys here that are more than just memories.
::'''Kumi''': So I feel that continuing to live here isn't bad either.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'm glad that we met.
:::'''Kumi''': I feel the same way. Thank you for your help previously.
:::'''Kumi''': Oh, by the way... [[Anisa]]'s been trying really hard to get used to life around here. Lately, she's been learning how to make our local cuisine from me.
:::'''Kumi''': It's just that she's, uh, made some changes to it based on flavors from [[Sumeru]]... I hope you don't mind.
::;(Obtain [[Suspicious Omelette Rice]] ×1)
::{{DIcon}} About Anisa...
:::'''Kumi''': She's... still as reckless as ever...
:::'''Kumi''': She doesn't seem to act like she's in a different nation at all. She just keeps going to strange and dangerous places every day...
:::'''Kumi''': And once she gets into her studies, that's the whole day she'll be spending on research I can't make heads or tails out of...
:::'''Kumi''': She honestly worries me a bit.
:::'''Kumi''': But she's also very considerate, and her voice is quite lovely. I think I can bear with it, I guess...
:::'''Kumi''': Um, don't misunderstand, please. She's a good person, so it's not as if I dislike her or something...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kumi''': Bye. I hope that everything goes well with you.
