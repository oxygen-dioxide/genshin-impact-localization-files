'''Record of Lamb-Devourer Rock''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|Hidden Mercenaries}}.

==Text==
To [[Etta]]<br><br>
Both you and I have suffered much in confinement.<br><br>
The rule of the king of kings is as inexorable as the coming sunset.<br>
Even so, I desire that you should be free.<br><br>
Freedom is like the morning dew that cannot be obtained anywhere.<br>
It is the river's flow, the most hidden oasis, the source of all wisdom.<br><br>
I pray that one day, should the [[Parvezravan|Spirit of Victory]]  be no longer victorious,<br>
That his sword should be corroded from pride, his crown abandoned on the ground.<br>
And when that time comes, all shackles shall be broken,<br>
And every garden shall be filled with singing.<br><br>
And then the morning dew shall come silently with the moonlight,<br>
To carry us at speed to the ends of the yellow sands,<br>
Farther away than the skies.

==Trivia==
* The sender of this record was probably [[Nefumat]], as both he and Etta were mentioned in the [[Transparent Ruins Record (I)]] and [[Transparent Ruins Record (II)]].
