'''Hydrograna''' are [[Grana]] found in [[Fontaine]]. Players can collect Hydrograna by walking into them, and they last for 15 seconds. When three Hydrograna are collected, they will combine to form a Hydro Core which continuously applies {{Hydro}} in an [[AoE]] around the player. If the player has only one or two Hydrograna, more can be generated if the Hydrograna comes into contact with something affected by Hydro.

Hydrogranum can be used to complete puzzles involving [[Water Volume Detection Crystal]]s.
