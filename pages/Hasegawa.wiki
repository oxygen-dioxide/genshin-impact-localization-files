==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:'''Hasegawa:''' An outlander out on the road. What a rare sight nowadays.
:{{DIcon}} About the Almighty Shogun...
::'''Hasegawa:''' As a local of Inazuma, I'm a faithful follower of the Almighty Shogun, just like everybody else.
::'''Hasegawa:''' However, the Almighty Shogun's recent policy has been pretty harsh...
::{{DIcon}} You mean the [[Sakoku Decree]]?
:::'''Hasegawa:''' Exactly! After the ban of foreign cargo ships, many imported high-end goods have become a thing of the past.
:::'''Hasegawa:''' I haven't been able to taste the Dandelion Wine from [[Mondstadt]]. And it has been a long time since I got any custom-made silks from Liyue, either...
:::'''Hasegawa:''' If I can't buy anything, what use do I have for this much money? Don't you agree?
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} It seems like you are very knowledgeable.
::::'''Hasegawa:''' Heh, with my family background, traveling abroad was a simple matter.
::::'''Hasegawa:''' I used to travel a lot, so I've naturally seen many things. But now...
::::'''Hasegawa:''' *sigh* I feel nostalgia when I reminisce about my past adventures... I guess I'll share those experiences with you.
:::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4)
::{{DIcon}} You mean the Vision Hunt Decree?
:::'''Hasegawa:''' The [[Vision Hunt Decree]]... Well, that doesn't really bother me anyway.
:::'''Hasegawa:''' After all, there aren't that many people with [[Vision]]s. It's not affecting me much.
:::'''Hasegawa:''' As for how they'll go on after losing their Visions... Well, I'm not sure. Does it have anything to do with me, though?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hasegawa:''' Goodbye. I hope everything will get better.

;(After completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:'''Hasegawa:''' Hello there. Are you a tourist, here to see the sights in Inazuma City?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Almighty Shogun...
::'''Hasegawa:''' As a local of Inazuma, I'm a faithful follower of the Almighty Shogun, just like everybody else.
::'''Hasegawa:''' Thanks to her enlightened actions, our lives have been much happier of late.
::{{DIcon}} You mean the abolition of the Sakoku Decree?
:::'''Hasegawa:''' Exactly! While it was still in force, foreign cargo ships were banned and many imported high-end goods became things of the past.
:::'''Hasegawa:''' But now... now, I can taste Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine, and I can order custom-made silks from Liyue...
:::'''Hasegawa:''' Now that's the good life, wouldn't you say?
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} It seems like you know a lot.
::::'''Hasegawa:''' Heh, with my family background, traveling abroad was a simple matter.
::::'''Hasegawa:''' I traveled a lot, so I've seen a great number of things. If you don't mind, I don't mind sharing them with you.
:::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4)
::{{DIcon}} You mean the abolition of the Vision Hunt Decree?
:::'''Hasegawa:''' The Vision Hunt Decree... Well, that didn't really bother me anyway.
:::'''Hasegawa:''' After all, there aren't that many people with Visions, so it really didn't affect me.
:::'''Hasegawa:''' As for the things they experienced while dispossessed of their Visions... Well, I'm not sure. Does it have anything to do with me, though?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Hasegawa:''' See you. Things will get better still, you'll see!
