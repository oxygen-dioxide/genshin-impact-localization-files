'''Perilous Watersport''' is a [[Daily Commission]] in [[Tsurumi Island]], [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|A band of hilichurls have set up an encamptment at sea that endangers ships passing through. Defeat them and put an end to the threat they pose.}}
# Defeat all enemies 0/X

==Notes==
Enemies spawn on light floating towers with explosive barrels nearby that can be blown up (e.g., by using the [[Waverider]]'s armaments) to destroy the towers or knock the enemies into the water.

There are also [[Whirlpool]]s and destructible floating fences<!--is there an official name for these?--> around the encampment.
Since there are '''no''' upcurrents or ladders to assist in boarding the floating towers, it is not advisable to allow the Waverider to be destroyed.
(The only other solid ground nearby from which the enemies or explosive barrels can be attacked is the bases of the floating towers and fences.)
