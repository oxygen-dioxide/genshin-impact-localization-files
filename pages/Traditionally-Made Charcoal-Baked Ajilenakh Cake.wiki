But you can't help wondering... Is it really a "traditional" dish that catered to the tastes of Sumeru people a hundred years ago?

'''Traditionally-Made Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake''' is a [[Special Dish]] that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake]] with [[Faruzan]]. The [[recipe]] for Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake is obtainable from [[Lambad]] at [[Lambad's Tavern]] for 5,000 Mora.
