|text    = Hey, hey! I caught a lot of sparkling [[fireflies]] in the past few days, there are so many that I can't even fit them all into my bag!

At the beginning, I just wanted to add one or two to the shaker to make the most disgusting cocktail to scare those alcoholics. But the process of catching fireflies was so much fun that I couldn't stop... It's not my fault! Even my tail thinks so, it keeps swinging around without my control...

Ahem! *cough* Do you like shiny things? Um... Anyway, it's all for you!

If you want to thank me, just come and celebrate my birthday with me. I will decorate the room in advance with the remaining [[Small Lamp Grass]], [[Butterfly Wings]], and [[Starconch]]es...

You have to come!
