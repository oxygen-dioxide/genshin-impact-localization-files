'''Friends''' are players that are added to the Friends List in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Adding friends makes it easier to check their [[Profile|Player Profile]] and to join them for [[Co-Op Mode|Co-Op]] sessions. Private chat messages can be sent to friends. Friends can also be assigned a nickname for easier recognition. In addition, friends can receive requests to visit their [[Serenitea Pot]]. Unlocking the friends list requires [[Adventure Rank]] 2.

The '''My Friends''' menu can be access from the [[Paimon Menu]] by pressing the ''Friends'' button. The list is sorted by Online Status, [[Adventure Rank]], and Last Online time.

The Last Online time goes from "Today" to "31 days ago".

A total to 45 friends can be added to the friends list.

After activating the cross-save feature on PlayStation, the list will split itself into two: "Genshin Impact Friends" and "Genshin Impact Friends on PlayStation Network". The latter can only be seen when playing the game on PlayStation.

==[[File:Icon Add Friend.png|50px]] Add Friend==
The '''Add Friend''' menu is used to search for players and send friend requests using their UID. Players do not have to be online to receive friend requests.

A total for 50 friend requests can be sent to a single player before none can be received anymore. The player must accept or reject requests before any more can be received.
