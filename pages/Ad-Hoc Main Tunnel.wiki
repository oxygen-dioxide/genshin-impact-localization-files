{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Damaged Logs:''' (An aged diary. The pages bear some strange purple-black burn marks.)
::'''Damaged Logs:''' "...The excavation team shall be disbanded today, and once the collected data has been properly organized, it shall be handed over to the messenger from the [[Huishan Hall]] tomorrow. It may be the work of Treasure Hoarders, so everyone must stay on alert..."
::'''Damaged Logs:''' "The detailed data has been sent to the secretary at Yujing Terrace such that long-term implications for the Chasm may be estimated... A strange black mud-like substance was also discovered..."
::'''Damaged Logs:''' "...Purple-black mud... below... people... something came through the crack in the door..."

==Descriptions==
{{Description|"The miners sealed the tunnels that led further within when they dispersed, but they did leave one 'Mountainator' here."<br />
"Perhaps it was the orders of the higher-ups... It's not as if it would be practical to separate Liyue's mercantile pursuits from Glazed Sand Crystal for too long."|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/The Blocked Path|The Blocked Path]]}}

==Trivia==
* There is an opening near the middle of the area which seemingly leads to the surface, however trying to climb it will trigger an [[Out of Bounds|out of bounds]] reaction. It should also be noted that no such exits can be seen on [[The Chasm]]'s surface.

===Etymology===
* The word Ad-Hoc means "made only for a particular purpose or need, not planned before it happens",<ref>Cambridge Dictionary: [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ad-hoc ad-hoc]</ref> based on this as well as localization of other languages, it can be hypothesised that the tunnel may have been dug in a hurry with no planing beforehand. It was strictly created to lead to the deeper parts of the mine.
