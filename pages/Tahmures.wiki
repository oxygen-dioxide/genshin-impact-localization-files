==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
;Available before completing ''[[The Rainbow Destined to Burn]]''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tahmures:''' It was indeed the right decision to not wait for them.
:{{DIcon}} And who's "them"?
::'''Tahmures:''' What a bunch of slowpokes... I wrote to the [[Akademiya]] to request an archaeological team forever ago.
::'''Tahmures:''' As expected, they've made absolutely no progress. I haven't seen a single person from that team.
::'''Tahmures:''' In Natlan, where you stumble upon a Saurian relic every three steps and a Saurian ruin every ten, a delay of even a single day is a huge loss!
::{{DIcon}} And so you acted on your own?
::'''Tahmures:''' I'd like to call it "seizing a great academic opportunity with great precision."
::'''Tahmures:''' The [[Children of Echoes]] and their [[Saurian]] partners are all very adept at digging, so I hired the seasoned Mr. [[Akeor]] as my archaeological partner.
::'''Tahmures:''' And not to brag, but what we've found is already enough to sustain at least a year's academic work for me.
::'''Tahmures:''' Still, we've got to hurry. The people of Natlan have long gotten used to living around these ruins, so they often just use the antiques they find as daily tools.
::'''Tahmures:''' ...I'll write another letter to the Akademiya, if for nothing else than the hope that they'll convince the locals to stop using priceless relics to build up their walls.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Tahmures:''' See ya! Don't forget, time waits for no one!
{{Dialogue End}}

::'''Tahmures:''' The Children of Echoes and their Saurian partners are all very adept at digging, so I hired the seasoned Mr. Akeor as my archaeological partner.
::'''Tahmures:''' ...But in all honesty, I feel a sense of urgency to get on with my research. When they pick up antiques, the people of Natlan tend to just use them as tools... It's genuinely terrifying to watch.
::'''Tahmures:''' But you know how things have been in Natlan lately. Akeor already went off to fight the monsters with his Saurian, and I couldn't allow my personal affairs to cause a delay to his mission.
::'''Tahmures:''' And it seems like my research could actually help him out on the battlefield... That really would be amazing if so.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Tahmures:''' See ya! Don't forget, time waits for no one!
