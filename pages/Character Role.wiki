'''Character Roles''' are suggested roles for [[character]]s in [[Imaginarium Theater]]. Along with [[element]], character roles are filters on the Party Setup menu during Performance Prep when selecting Alternate Cast. Character roles can help players create a more balanced and comprehensive lineup, but players are free to ignore these roles entirely.

|[[File:Character Role On-Field.png|30px]]
|On-Field
|It is recommended that you allocate time for these characters to {{Color|bp|fight on the field}} as much as possible to fully utilize their strong suits.
|-
|[[File:Character Role Off-Field.png|30px]]
|Off-Field
|These characters can provide considerable assistance {{Color|bp|while off-field}}. Distribute your time between them and your on-field characters to better complete performance challenges.
|-
|[[File:Character Role DPS.png|30px]]

|This character archetype {{Color|bp|deals markedly greater damage}} to opponents within any set amount of time. It's recommended to give them sufficient time in combat.
|-
|[[File:Character Role Support.png|30px]]
|Support
|These characters have remarkable {{Color|bp|support capabilities}}, allowing other characters to fight more effectively. Distribute them across your teams to tackle and complete harder challenges.
|-
|[[File:Character Role Survivability.png|30px]]
|Survivability
|When you face stronger or more numerous opponents, these characters are more effective in {{Color|bp|dealing with incoming attacks}} while you find a way to turn things around.

==Additional Information==
All characters have at least one role in each of the following groups:
* On-Field, Off-Field
* DPS, Support, Survivability

Characters can have both of the former roles and all three of the latter roles, though this is rare.

The assigned character roles are the same for all players, and they appear to be conservatively assigned based on their gameplay mechanics at Constellation Level 0.<!-- no elemental application, no constellations even for 4*s, etc --> Additionally, teammate elements seem to have been assumed for [[Xilonen]].

It is important to note that none of the assigned roles appear to consider [[Artifact Set]]s or [[weapon]]s, including those recommended in places such as the [[Training Guide]], the artifact screen, and official promotional material posted on the Genshin Impact social media accounts based on data sourced from recently active players. Artifact Sets and weapons that show up as recommendations may allow characters to fit the description of the roles they are not assigned.
