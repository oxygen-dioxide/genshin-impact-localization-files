|description    = A crop rack built from Otogi Wood that can be used to cultivate all kinds of fruits and vegetables.<br />Although the [[Shogunate]] gives a certain monthly subsidy to fruit farmers for the sake of supporting the local fruit industry, it is impossible to say how much [[Mora]] the farmers actually get their hands on. Some farmers are considering switching to plant cash crops that meet rigid demand.
