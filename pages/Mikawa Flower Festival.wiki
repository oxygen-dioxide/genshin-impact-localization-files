The '''Mikawa Flower Festival''' is a festival in [[Inazuma]].

==Traditions==
The Mikawa Flower Festival was a lively festival held by the [[youkai]] to drink, laugh, and play music.<ref name="ToC">{{Ref/Quest|Test of Courage (Event Quest)}}</ref>

The highlight of the Mikawa Flower Festival was the game Akitsu Haneasobi, a game played with {{w|hagoita}}. Though the game was lost to time, the present-day revival of the Mikawa Flower Festival saw participants playing a new game called [[Akitsu Yuugei]].

==History==
The Mikawa Flower Festival dates back over five hundred years. Historically, many prominent youkai, as well as both [[Ei]] and [[Makoto]], attended the festival.<ref name="ToC"/> [[Kitsune Saiguu]] and [[Yae Miko]] were also in attendance.<ref name="CoL">{{Ref/Quest|The Currents of Life}}</ref>

One year, a human samurai named [[Yanagibashi Takuto]] accidentally entered the Mikawa Flower Festival, and the youkai began to plot to figure out how to get him to leave. However, one youkai, [[Kamai Kenji]], declared, "This is our festival, and the point is to have fun!" He invited Yanagibashi to drink sake with him, and the two played Akitsu Haneasobi together, resulting in a draw. The two agreed to meet for a duel every ten years.<ref name="HT">{{Ref/Quest|Haunted Tales}}</ref> This friendship proved to have a profound effect on both Kamai and Yanagibashi's lives, and the type of swordsmanship used in their duels influenced the [[Souran Isshin Art]], which Yanagibashi founded.<ref name="CoL" />

==Present Day==
Three young youkai named [[Youko]], [[Kappa]], and [[Hitotsume Kozou]] wanted to hold their own Mikawa Flower Festival, but lacked the youkai power to set up the festival. Their version of the festival was intended to be a message of gratitude to humans who drove off monsters and allowed them to live in peace.<ref name="ToC" /> [[Arataki Itto]] came across them at the Test of Courage event, and decided to help them put on the festival.

The Test of Courage event itself was set up by [[Kamisato Ayato]] after he learned of the three little youkais' plans to put on the Mikawa Flower Festival, as he wanted to attract people to the area without creating high expectations.<ref name="CoL" />
