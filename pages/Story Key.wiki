'''Story Keys''' are quest unlock items that players after [[Adventure Rank]] 26 can use to unlock [[Story Quests]] and [[Hangout Events]].

Players can claim one Story Key every 8 [[Commissions]] completed (i.e. 2 days of 4 Commissions). Story Keys will not be earned automatically and must be claimed from the Story Quests menu once eligible. A total of 3 Story Keys can be held at once time, but the counter will still continue to max out at 8, so one is able to immediately be claimed after one has been spent.
* Story Quest Acts available before Adventure Rank 32 do not require Story Keys.
* Story Quest Acts available after Adventure Rank 32 require 1 Story Key.
* Hangout Event Acts require 2 Story Keys and repeating the same Hangout will not require more.
