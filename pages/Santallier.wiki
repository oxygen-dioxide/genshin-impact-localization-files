:'''Santallier:''' Actually... I've mentioned this to the higher-ups, that this area doesn't need to be patrolled.
:'''[[Ophelia]]:''' I think that's reasonable.
:'''Santallier:''' I mean, this is the safest block in the area, and the Champion Duelists have their office right over there.
:'''Ophelia:''' Exactly.
:'''Santallier:''' I didn't expect them to say "only you can take up the grand task of patrolling this area."
:'''Ophelia:''' Seriously, did they...
:'''Santallier:''' Well... I've heard everyone say that you're a brilliant adventurer.
:'''Santallier:''' Guess we're pretty similar in how people have pinned their hopes on us, huh?
:'''Santallier:''' Wanna go get a drink after work — y'know, from one person with a similar fate to another?
:'''Ophelia:''' No, I'm afraid adventurers are never "off work."
