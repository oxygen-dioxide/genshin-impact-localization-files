==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Sakuya is a gardener and florist who owns and runs a flower shop called "Sakura's Flowers." The shop used to be located in [[Inazuma City]], but is now located by her flower field. She is skilled in the art of ikebana &mdash; the act of carefully cutting and processing plants, and arranging them neatly and according to their environment. She learned the craft together with [[Fushizome]] under their Ikebana master.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Fushizome}}</ref>

During events, such as the [[Irodori Festival]], Sakuya provides the flowers used in events pertaining to floral arts such as ikebana. She did not, however, participate in the Ikebana event because of the crowd.

===Appearance===
Sakuya is adult female with fair skin and brown eyes. Her golden-brown hair is neatly styled into a bun, with a pink flower-shaped hair clip on the left. She wears an Inazuman-style garb that is primarily blue-gray with a white flower print, black and white socks, and red-soled sandals.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sakuya:''' Hello there! How would you like to grow some flowers of your very own?
:{{DIcon|Flower}} About the flowers...
:;(If there are Dreambloom seeds available to claim)
:::'''Sakuya:''' Would you like to have some fun with growing flowers and ikebana? Sure.
::;(Opens the Dreambloom exchange menu)
:;(If Dreambloom seeds are already claimed)
:::'''Sakuya:''' You might want to plant the seeds that you already have first. Everything in its good time, as they say.
:;(If the exchange period for Dreambloom seeds has already ended)
:::'''Sakuya:''' My apologies, but this iteration of Dreams of Bloom has ended. I need to tend to my business in the flower field now.
:::'''Sakuya:''' Swing by and have some fun the next time I organize similar events.
:{{DIcon}} So, tell me about ikebana...
::'''Sakuya:''' Ikebana is very important to Inazuma.
::'''Sakuya:''' In simple terms, you can consider ikebana the act of carefully cutting and processing flowers and other plants before arranging them in a suitable fashion...
::'''Sakuya:''' In specific, however, you need to take care to grasp the current state of the plants and trim the less presentable parts of them away...
::'''Sakuya:''' Moreover, your arrangement and placement must be suited to their environment, even down to the angle at which the flowers extend outward...
::'''Sakuya:''' These details must be given fastidious consideration, and can be a cumbersome process indeed.
::'''Sakuya:''' Even for someone who loves ikebana like me, it is a most tiring job...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sakuya:''' Mm, see you.
