==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hugues:''' I wonder if Lucelle's doing alright...
:{{DIcon}} Lucelle?
::'''Hugues:''' *sigh* An old companion of mine. It could have lived free after I modified it, but then they took it away from me.
::'''Hugues:''' There was no time to take anything back, because they then gave me a new workplace &mdash; the Fortress of Meropide.
::'''Hugues:''' By the way, before Lucelle belonged to me, it was a [[Gardemek]] with the [[Gardes]].
::'''Hugues:''' It didn't resist when I modified it, so I took that as consent.
::{{DIcon}} And that's how you landed a new job in jail.
::'''Hugues:''' ...Yes.
::'''Hugues:''' Even so, this job has some perks over my previous work at the Fontaine Research Institute.
::'''Hugues:''' My time in Meropide was more conducive to creativity, to be honest, given the lack of complicated processes and boring summary meetings.
::'''Hugues:''' Even my daily meals were delivered by clockwork machines. Such an enviable situation! A shame, though, that the [[Wolsey|canteen manager]] refused to sell me [[Bran|that machine]].
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Alright, such an innovative spirit should be praised.
::'''Hugues:''' I doubt this is a compliment.
::'''Hugues:''' No matter what, such an innovative spirit deserves praise.
::'''Hugues:''' I have some materials of various sorts, please take some. See if you can come up with some innovative ideas.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Condessence Crystal|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Not too sure about what you're saying here.
::'''Hugues:''' No problem, just take it as me talking to myself.
