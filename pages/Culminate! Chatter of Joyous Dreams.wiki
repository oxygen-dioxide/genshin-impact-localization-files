;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's about time for us to head to Sumeru and investigate that group of thieves. Paimon's got a feeling that it won't be long before we have a breakthrough on the case.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 1 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Let's head to [[Caravan Ribat]] first. That's near the designated pickup location.

;(Approach the marked area in Caravan Ribat)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are we getting close? Which way should we go now?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' We just need to head a short way towards the desert. It's not far.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I would recommend taking a bodyguard to protect you. If the customer does turn out to be rotten, you can let the bodyguard deal with them.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good point! Hmm, a bodyguard...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, look! Isn't that Cyno!?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cyno!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Good to see you. Headed to Caravan Ribat?
:{{Introductory Note|Cyno}}
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Remember Paimon, we can't just disclose a customer's information...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh, don't worry. This is Sumeru's General Mahamatra, Cyno. He's the leader of the Matra, and always takes criminal activity very seriously.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Wow, how do you know so many powerful people?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Heh, you'd better get used to it Kirara. You wouldn't believe the people I've met since I started traveling with them.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you have some time now, Cyno? Or do you need to go participate in the Genius Invokation tournament?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Tournament? Heh, the tournament has already finished.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Then how did you do, Cyno?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I am now the official King of Invokations.
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations.
:{{DIcon}} Did you crush the competition?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I used Forbidden Hand at the opportune moment and drew...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Ahem. I... I can explain it later. Anyway, I have time.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Let Paimon catch you up on what's happening...
:{{Black Screen|After Paimon explains for some time...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon's parched now... How many times is Paimon gonna have to explain everything?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I can accompany you. As Paimon said, it's my duty to uphold the rules and punish evil.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' What do you think, Kirara?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Alright, but remember, you all should hide while I'm delivering the parcel.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I know that this customer is suspicious, but they're still my customer until we have any concrete proof otherwise.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, we'll go hide.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But if we're too far away, we won't be able to hear anything you're saying. How will we know if you're in trouble?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Not a problem, you can just watch my tails.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your tails? You mean both of them?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Of course, both of them! I'll come up with a way to have the customer confirm the contents of the package.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' If they turn out to be just an ordinary customer and the package doesn't contain the card backs, then I'll lower both of my tails. That'll mean you can just stay hidden.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 09.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' But if they turn out to be the thieves we're after, then I'll...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Lay down.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Huh? Why would she do that?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It'd be a signal, that we need to "lay down" the law...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 10.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' No way, I'm not getting on the ground, that would be way too embarrassing! Besides, don't you think that would look suspicious?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You think so? Then maybe you can use your tails to pound your back.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Uh, and why should she do that?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Simple. It'd be signal that she had "found the backs" we're looking for.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' This is the first time I've met someone as creative with their words as I am.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Have you ever considered a career in writing news headlines, Cyno?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, don't enable him...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 11.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Okay, if we keep standing around talking like this, the package is going to be late.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 12.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Listen to me. If they're the thieves, I'll lift one tail up and keep the other one down. If you see that, then you can come round them up.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You're not going to lay down?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 13.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' NO! I'm not laying down!

;(On the way to the delivery address)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're in the middle of nowhere, though. Are you sure this is the right place, Kirara?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 kirara 14.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Let's see, the address is, "Approximately 100 paces down the road from Caravan Ribat towards the desert, near the first Flaming Flower."
:{{A|vo dpeq004 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the most suspicious address Paimon's ever heard!
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 3 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Near the first Flaming Flower... Ah, we're here.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, there aren't any houses around here.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 3 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Maybe the recipient planned on coming here to personally receive the package. I've had customers do that in the past.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 3 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' We're still a little early. In the meantime, why don't the rest of you go find a place to hide?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 3 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' And remember, watch my tails for the signal!

;(Talk to Kirara, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' The customer will be here soon, so be sure to stay out of sight.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Kirara, optional)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 3 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' (Meow...)

;(Go to the hiding place)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We'll hide here. This spot is hidden, but with a clear view.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's sure this recipient's up to no good! Who'd pick up a package in a place like this!?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I agree.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But for the sake of her company's reputation, we'll let her "tail" us what to do.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' What? As in her "tails"...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah yeah, we get it...
:{{Black Screen|After waiting behind the rocks for a while...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! Someone's coming!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 01.ogg}} '''Recipient:''' You from [[Komaniya Express]]?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' That's right. You must be Mr. Dedebaba?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 02.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' Where's the package?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ah yes, this is your package. Here you go.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 03.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I recommend that you open it and confirm the contents. I've been running to many places the past few days through all sorts of weather. The contents may have shifted, so it's best to check that everything's intact.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 04.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' No need. You haven't opened it to see what's inside, have you?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Of course not. That would be against our company policy.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' But if the contents are valuable, I would still recommend checking them first. If anything turns out to be damaged, I could compensate you now.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 05.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' I said no need, didn't I? Why are you so persistent?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 pabag 01.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' You know, Boss... This little lady's out here all on her own.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 papak 01.ogg}} '''Papak:''' We could use that to our advantage, you know...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 06.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' Hey, you. Are you the only one delivering out here?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? Uh, y&mdash;yes, that's right... I wouldn't bring a bunch of people with me to deliver a package.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' (Uh oh! I'm no good at lying! And I can't keep my tails from moving everywhere!)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, she's giving a signal!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But wait... Uh, Paimon doesn't recognize that signal at all.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ah, I nearly forgot... Th&mdash;This just happens to be my 100th delivery. It's a really special moment for me!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 09.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' If you could let me know what I delivered, it would mean a lot to me!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Her tails are moving all over the place!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does she need us to step in or not?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Her tails keep moving and intertwining... They keep pointing in different directions...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Ah! Maybe she's trying to say that she mixed up her directions! These people aren't the intended recipients!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously!? There's no way anyone could get all that from just her tails!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 07.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' Something's not right... I can feel it. And you seem real concerned about this package, missy.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 10.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh, hehe, no... That's just part of my job, we always care about the customer! Are you really not going to open it?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 pabag 02.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' C'mon Boss, enough talk!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 papak 02.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Yeah, nobody will ever know anything happened way out here!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 kirara 11.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uh, th&mdash;then do you have a moment to leave a five-star review?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 08.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' Hmph, sure. I'll leave a five-star review... after you're dead!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! They've got a knife! Forget the signals!
;(Everyone except Paimon runs to Kirara)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've gotta save Kirara!
;(Paimon turns around to see no one is with her)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 pabag 03.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' Boss! She's got backup!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 09.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' What are ya afraid of!? Get 'em!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 papak 03.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Huh? Wait, th&mdash;that's Cyno! The General Mahamatra!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 4 dedebaba 10.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' C&mdash;Cyno!?

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kirara, are you alright?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 dedebaba 01.ogg}} '''Dedebaba:''' Had I known you were here, we wouldn't have...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Too late for that. And I don't want to hear any whining from you two, either. Clear?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 01.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' Y&mdash;Yes... C&mdash;Crystal clear!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 01.ogg}} '''Papak:''' General Mahamatra, I&mdash;I don't want to go to prison... Can't you just let us off this one time?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That depends on how honest you are.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 02.ogg}} '''Papak:''' We'll tell you everything!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' What's inside the package?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 03.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Card backs... Genius Invokation TCG card backs that we collected from different nations.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are they the kind with a treasure chest design on them?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 02.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' Y&mdash;Yeah, that's right! Wait, how'd you know that?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:{{DIcon}} And why are you stealing card backs?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 03.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' W&mdash;We're just a group of [[Treasure Hoarders]], that's all...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 04.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Some hoarders were getting fed up recently with just stealing small stuff. They wanted to, uh...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Go on.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 05.ogg}} '''Papak:''' They wanted to pull off something big... You know, not just in one nation, all across Teyvat!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All across Teyvat?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 04.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' Yeah, we were planning to steal prized treasures from different nations all at the same time.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 05.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' After pulling off a job like that, everyone would recognize us Treasure Hoarders as the most powerful organization across the world!
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 06.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' But, uh... seems like that's not gonna happen now.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what does any of that have to do with these card backs?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 06.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Well, the problem was we didn't know how to communicate our master plan to all the other Treasure Hoarders.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 07.ogg}} '''Papak:''' But with how popular Genius Invokation TCG has become recently, somebody suddenly came up with the idea to use cards as a way to communicate our plans without being detected.
::[[File:Duel! The Summoners' Summit! Card Back.png|100px]]
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you were the ones who printed these card backs.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 08.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Yeah... Because every Treasure Hoarder knows what to do once they see a treasure chest.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 09.ogg}} '''Papak:''' First you bury it, so no one else can take it. Then just add a little bit of...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 07.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' Hey, shut it! You're givin' away all our plans...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It appears you consider this ridiculous plan of yours more valuable than your own life.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 10.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Ahh! N&mdash;No, no, no! I'll talk, I'll talk...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 11.ogg}} '''Papak:''' All you need to do is cover it with some wet dirt or sand, then wipe it off after a while...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 12.ogg}} '''Papak:''' And it'll look like this.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "My fellow hoarders, this is the big job we've all been waiting for. Take up your daggers, put on your masks, and round up your Sumpter Beasts..."
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Oh, and for those of you without Sumpter Beasts..."
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously, that's all it says? What a waste!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 08.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' Hey, whaddya mean "waste"!? That message will mobilize the Treasure Hoarders!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 13.ogg}} '''Papak:''' H&mdash;He's right, the time and other details are printed below that.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see... Oh, there it is!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hmm, objectively speaking, it's definitely a creative method of communicating information.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But then why were you trying to retrieve these card backs?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 09.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' It's all because some fellow hoarders got addicted to Genius Invokation!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 10.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' All they needed to do was stick to the plan, but they couldn't help themselves and started playing the game! Not only that, they were even using our card backs and showing 'em off!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 pabag 11.ogg}} '''Pabag:''' But that wasn't the worst of it, some of them ended up losing our card backs to other players.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ah, you were afraid that your plans would be exposed, so you dispatched members to quickly retrieve the card backs that had been scattered into the markets.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 14.ogg}} '''Papak:''' Not just the ones on the markets, we collected ALL our treasure chest card backs and we had them shipped back.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 15.ogg}} '''Papak:''' We feared that our plans had already been discovered, so we were preparing to print another set of card backs. They would indicate a different time to initiate the operation, and we'd redistribute them...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 16.ogg}} '''Papak:''' But to take every precaution, we raised funding for everyone to send us the backs via Komaniya Express. That way, we could guarantee the card backs would arrive safely and on time.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? Oh, uh thanks for the compliments...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So the senders would stay at their original location to ensure that the operation could continue moving forward.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Now that I think about it, that must be why the Treasure Hoarders came after the person who sold the card back in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! It's no wonder we were running into the Treasure Hoarders left and right. They wanted to be sure that anyone involved stayed quiet.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 papak 17.ogg}} '''Papak:''' There, I told you everything I know. Hopefully that will help us make up for our mistakes... Please, Mahamatra Cyno, show us mercy!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You'll each receive your due punishment. Enough talk, come with me.
:{{Black Screen|You follow Cyno back to Caravan Ribat...}}
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I've taken care of the criminals for now. I'll be escorting them back to Sumeru City shortly.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for all your help.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I was only fulfilling my duty. You all did well.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' (Cyno seems like a completely different person when he's working.)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, goodbye for now.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, wait wait wait! I still wanna interview the champion of the Sumeru regional tournament.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, go ahead.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Tell me, Mr. Cyno, what were your thoughts about the tournament? And did you have anything to say about the Treasure Hoarder incident?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Genius Invokation TCG is a very good game. But to me, it's not just a game, it's an art form. It allows people to meet others, make friends, and experience the joy of dueling together.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I hope everyone can have the chance to experience the fun of playing this game.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Great answer. That'll be a perfect ending for my news piece.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Therefore, I assure you that I will personally bring judgment to any criminals out there with delusions of desecrating this game with their evil plans. No matter where you run, or where you hide, you will not escape the punishment of lightning.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh! Ahem, I see... Let's stay calm, no need to get worked up.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Now let me think...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hmm... "Not-So-Genius Thieves Behind Mysterious Treasure-Chest Card Back Plot Finally"... umm...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' "Got decked..." You get it, like cards and punching?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 13.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Yes, that'll work nicely!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These two make quite the team when it comes to words.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If that's all, then I should get going.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 18.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'll inform the other areas not to get gamed by these thieving Treasure Hoarders.
:{{DIcon}} Take care, Cyno.
:{{DIcon}} Let's play a game of Genius Invokation next time.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We will.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So in the end, it turned out that the group of card snatchers we were tracking was the Treasure Hoarders all along.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still feels a little disappointing though... Paimon thought for sure those card backs would lead us to some valuable treasure.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 14.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Don't say that. Think of the bright side, we uncovered a major international crime scheme!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 15.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I definitely have everything I need for my exclusive news piece.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If anything, Paimon regrets that we didn't get to see the mysterious inventors of Genius Invokation TCG.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hehe, it seems everyone can't stop talking about that game.
:{{DIcon}} It's just fun to play cards.
:{{DIcon}} It's fun to meet new friends.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' In that case, how would everyone like to join me for a very special delivery?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You mean it's related to Genius Invokation TCG?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Mm-hmm, that's right. You'll understand when we get there.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I would have invited Cyno along too if he wasn't busy with work.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 16.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh really? But didn't you say before that you can't disclose customer information?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yeah, but this time the situation's different.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Let's just say, this delivery wasn't assigned to me by the company.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 09.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' This package had been sitting at the company for some time because we couldn't ever locate the recipient. Even the neighbors didn't know where he went.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so the company eventually took ownership of the package?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 10.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yep, the holding period passed just last month.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 17.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But can't you just return it to the original sender?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 11.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Well, it turns out the sender has passed away.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's terrible...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 12.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yeah, and I thought both the original sender and intended recipient would be disappointed if this package is left undelivered.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 13.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' So I took the initiative and started asking around Sumeru in my free time. Eventually, I found out where the recipient went, and also learned a little about his past.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, amazing! So who is it?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 14.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Well... Hehe, you'll have to come with me and see.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 15.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I have a feeling that it'll be good to have some true Genius Invokation TCG players like you come along.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 charlotte 18.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, sounds like another news story brewing. I'll tag along, as well.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, now Paimon's really curious...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Shall we join her?
:{{DIcon}} Of course.
:{{DIcon}} It's our duty as TCG players.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 5 kirara 16.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Alright, then follow me to [[Vimara Village]].
----
;(Approach the marked area in Vimara Village)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 6 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' The clues pointed to Vimara Village, but I'm not sure of which house they live in exactly.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 6 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Guess we'll have to ask around.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Any idea what the recipient looks like?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 6 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I only know his name is Garvipidam, and that he's a scholar from the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Garvipidam... got it.

;(Talk to Zadith)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi there, do you know where Garvipidam lives?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 zadith 01.ogg}} '''Zadith:''' Hmm, I'm afraid I've never heard that name before.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's a scholar from the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 zadith 02.ogg}} '''Zadith:''' Oh, yes, there is a scholar around here, but I've never heard anyone go by the name you mentioned.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 zadith 03.ogg}} '''Zadith:''' Are you sure you've got the right name? Actually, I'd like to ask him a few questions myself regarding which of the Six Darshans to join!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, sounds like he doesn't know. Let's go ask someone else.

;(Talk to Arezo)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there, we're looking for a scholar named Garvipidam.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 arezo 01.ogg}} '''Arezo:''' Garvipidam? Never heard of 'em.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 arezo 02.ogg}} '''Arezo:''' Ah, wait. Do you mean that newcomer that arrived a few days ago?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, someone just moved here?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 arezo 03.ogg}} '''Arezo:''' Yes, that's right. He looked pretty anxious though, almost like he's struggling to complete a thesis.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 arezo 04.ogg}} '''Arezo:''' I've seen him speaking with the village head, probably looking for a place to stay.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 arezo 05.ogg}} '''Arezo:''' Vimara Village is the perfect place to take a vacation and relax, which is why I chose to come back here.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it, thank you. We'll go talk to the head of the village.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 arezo 06.ogg}} '''Arezo:''' Don't mention it. If life is ever treatin' ya hard, you can always come and live here for a while.

;(Talk to Amadhiah)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello, are you the head of the village? There's something we'd like to ask you about.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 01.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' Yes, that's me. Go ahead.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you know where a scholar by the name of Garvipidam lives? We'd like to talk to him.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 02.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' Garvipidam? Ah, that must be him...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know him?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 03.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' Yes, I do. He came here to rent a place to stay. He said he needed to unwind a little.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 04.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' But hardly anyone's ever seen him come out since he moved in, he doesn't seem to be very outgoing.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 05.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' I don't know if that's his way of "unwinding," but I'd say he's just keeping himself cooped up.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 06.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' Are you friends of his?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yeah, you could say that.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Hmm? Her tails are moving again. Is that what happens whenever she tells a lie?)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 07.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' Ah, I see. I was thinking that it'd be good for some friends to check up on him.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 08.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' He's staying up above, look for the house in the corner. You should be able to find him there.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great, thank you very much!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 7 amadhiah 09.ogg}} '''Amadhiah:''' Don't mention it. I just want to see people who come here be happy.

;(Approach the house)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is the place. Let's try knocking and see if he answers.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello? Anybody home? We're looking for Garvipidam.
:'''Garvipidam:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 01.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Yes, that's me. Can I help you?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hello Mr. Garvipidam, I'm Kirara. I have a delivery from Komaniya Express... I'm afraid the package is quite late.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 02.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' A package? For me?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yes, it's from a Mr. Gulab.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 03.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Wh&mdash;What? Gulab? But how is that possible...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yes, it seems your friend submitted the package to our company before he passed.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 04.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Friend? Hah, some friend I am... There was nothing I could do about his illness, and I wasn't by his side during the last moments of his life.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Don't say that. After all, you and Gulab are the creators of Genius Invokation TCG. I'm sure Gulab would have been happy to know how popular the game has become.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Say what!? He's one of the creators of Genius Invokation TCG!?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 05.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' *sigh* Why... Why does it seem that misfortune always befalls geniuses like him?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' If you don't mind, perhaps you could talk to us about it? It would probably help you feel better.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 06.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' ...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 07.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Hah, you're right. Maybe I should tell you...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 08.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' You really wouldn't mind listening?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, you can talk to us.
:{{DIcon}} You'll feel better.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 09.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Alright then... It's not much of a story, really.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 10.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' I knew Gulab ever since we were kids. We were classmates and grew up together.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 11.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Other than the bandages on his arms, you could hardly tell he had [[Eleazar]]. He was always positive, peaceful, and kind...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 12.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Later, we both entered the Akademiya, and he became a [[Rtawahist]] Dastur.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' If I remember correctly, that's a pretty high position.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 13.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Haha. Yes, he really was that smart.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 14.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' But before long, the Eleazar got worse and led to some serious complications.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 15.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' After that, he became bedridden. He received treatment in the hospital, but had to abandon his research.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 16.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' I would go see him in the hospital every day, even though he said there was no need for me to visit so often.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' He must have been worried that he was taking time from your own research.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 17.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' I know, but I couldn't bear to just leave him like that. He was clearly the smarter of the two of us.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 18.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' We would have some free time whenever I visited him, so we took some cards and started painting them.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 19.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Over time, those cards became the basis for Genius Invokation TCG.
:{{DIcon}} A game that was born from friendship.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 20.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' It's not only a game. When we were designing it, I deliberately incorporated some theoretical knowledge of the elements.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 21.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' I was originally waiting for him to recover, so we could study the subject together. But in the end...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, don't be sad. Genius Invokation TCG is the result of your research together.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not to mention, a lot of people are enjoying it now.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 22.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' *sigh* After he passed away, I tried to play the game with someone else...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 23.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' But every time I looked up, all I could see was his silhouette. It was as if he was still sitting there at the table...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 24.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' I know it was all in my head, though...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, Paimon understands. Paimon wouldn't ever be able to get used to being away from {{Traveler}}. Paimon would probably find herself talking to the wind as if the Traveler could hear...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 25.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Yes. Everyone else has told me that I have to move on and embrace the fun of Genius Invokation, saying that I'm one of its creators...
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 26.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' But to be honest, without Gulab, what meaning does the game have anymore...?
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Garvipidam, perhaps you should see what your friend sent you in the package.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 27.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Ah, right.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 8 garvipidam 28.ogg}} '''Garvipidam:''' Hmm!? What's this?&nbsp;...A letter?

::'''Gulab:''' My dear friend, you must be wondering
::'''Gulab:''' Why I'm leaving you a letter like this
::'''Gulab:''' It's because...
::'''Garvipidam:''' Hey, Gulab! I'm here. How are you feeling today?
::'''Garvipidam:''' I gotta tell you, I had an idea for another card last night
::'''Garvipidam:''' Huh? What's that you're writing?
::'''Gulab:''' Haha, it's nothing
::'''Garvipidam:''' Okay... Anyway, up for a game?
::'''Gulab:''' You don't have to visit every day, you know. You should be focusing on your work at the Akademiya...
::'''Garvipidam:''' Hey, enough of that, I'll keep visiting until you've fully recovered
::'''Garvipidam:''' Besides, I can't stand most of the folks at the Akademiya anyway!
::'''Garvipidam:''' Hey, it's your turn
::'''Gulab:''' *coughing*
::'''Garvipidam:''' Gulab!? Are you okay?
::'''Gulab:''' *cough* Garvipidam, you must understand...
::'''Gulab:''' My Eleazar...
::'''Garvipidam:''' Hey! Don't talk like that!
::'''Garvipidam:''' You just need some more rest...
::'''Gulab:''' *sigh*...
::'''Gulab:''' It's because... you won't come to terms with the fact that I don't have long left
::'''Gulab:''' Guess what? This game we invented
::'''Gulab:''' Is getting pretty popular here in the hospital
::'''Garvipidam:''' Really? That's great news!
::'''Gulab:''' Yeah. I've even made a device
::'''Gulab:''' To help people find other players nearby
::'''Gulab:''' Here, this one's for you
::'''Gulab:''' This way, you'll be able to keep playing even after I'm&mdash;
::'''Garvipidam:''' Just stop!
::'''Garvipidam:''' You're gonna get better, you hear me? I don't need this thing... I don't want it!
::'''Gulab:''' I imagine the Casket of Tomes I gave you
::'''Gulab:''' Is probably gathering dust in a corner somewhere...
::'''Gulab:''' So, this is my last gift to you. I'm sorry that I could only give it to you now
::'''Gulab:''' Do you remember when we first met?
::'''Gulab:''' You were the only one willing to be friends with the kid with Eleazar
::'''Gulab:''' Now it's my turn to help you make some new friends
::'''Gulab:''' This way, I'll always be by your side, my friend

:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! It was a good thing that Kirara kept track of that package, even when they were unable to deliver it.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' When my boss asked me to take care of it, I had a feeling that it must somehow be delivered, I couldn't just let it be abandoned.

:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Maybe, I'm not sure. I guess I just didn't want to let the sender's sentiment go to waste like that.

:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, by the way, I still haven't had the chance to interview you two all this time.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' After all that we've witnessed on this journey together, do you have anything you'd like to say?
:{{DIcon}} We made a lot of new friends...
::{{A|vo dpeq004 9 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! You could say the best thing we got out of this adventure was the new friends we made!
:{{DIcon}} We learned a lot about Genius Invokation TCG...
::{{A|vo dpeq004 9 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We'll never see the game the same way, it means a lot more to us now!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I understand. I'll be sure to work your comments into my exclusive news piece.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Just be sure to buy a copy of The Steambird when you visit Fontaine!
:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' And I should get ready to head back to Inazuma. I still have to report everything to my boss.
:{{DIcon}} Take care, everyone.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Will do! I'm sure we'll all see each other again soon.
:{{A|vo dpeq004 9 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' And maybe we'll play Genius Invokation TCG if we have the chance.

===Diona and Draff===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Diona or Draff at the Teleport Waypoint next to the bridge leading into Mondstadt City)
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hey Dad, want to play a game of Genius Invokation?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But before we play, I got one thing to say to you! If you're already tipsy from drinking today, then the game will be over in three rounds.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 draff 01.ogg}} '''Draff:''' In three rounds? Sounds like you're underestimating your dear father.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 draff 02.ogg}} '''Draff:''' I'm pretty sure I could drag the game out to at least five rounds.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph! And you'd still lose! You think that's something to be proud of?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Last time we played, you mistook the Hydro Elemental Dice you rolled for Cryo! Ugh, so annoying!
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 draff 03.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Haha, you know I have a problem with my eyesight...
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' No, you have a problem with drinking! Don't try to cover it up!
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 draff 04.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Alright, alright, I know, drinking is bad. I won't drink today, not even a single drop. There, happy?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I guess so.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 draff 05.ogg}} '''Draff:''' Now, if I DO win, what's the prize?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' What? You're trying to get me to mix you a drink? Don't you even think about it!
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 draff 06.ogg}} '''Draff:''' What if I win in under five rounds?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In your dreams, I won't lose! Let's start!

===Beidou and Kaedehara Kazuha===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Beidou or Kaedehara Kazuha at [[Guyun Stone Forest]] near [[Domain of Guyun]])
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' So, you leave for a few days and come back with some serious TCG skills. Care to explain?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I was fortunate enough to have played a match with a skilled opponent.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh? And who might that be? Wait, let me try to guess...
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Ningguang doesn't have the time for this sort of thing... Hmm, Xiangling and Xinyan aren't usually practicing either...
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' If Yaoyao were free, she'd be running down to the ship to say hi to everyone, so that rules her out.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 05b.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hah, could it be {{Traveler}}? Did {{MC|m=he|f=she}} happen to be in Liyue Harbor?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kazuha 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kazuha 02b.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Sorry Captain, you still haven't guessed it. But I did happen to see {{Traveler}}, and even forged a new friendship over cards...
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh, made a new friend, huh? Then I won't be able to guess it.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, I met Hu Tao, director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Have you heard of her?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Yeah, I've heard of her before. Isn't she the one that won the King of Invokations Grand Prix in Liyue?
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' That's right. She said that she's been an admirer of yours for a long time, and hopes to make your acquaintance one day.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Alright! There isn't a better opportunity!
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' We'll invite her aboard to play a few matches, and I'll get a taste of playing against a champion.
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 beidou 10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh, speaking of which, perhaps I should go find her personally at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. You know, to show some sincerity.

===Sangonomiya Kokomi===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sangonomiya Kokomi on a cliff near the [[Statue of The Seven]], overlooking [[Watatsumi Island]])
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hmm? Oh, did you make the trip all the way back here just to see me?
:{{DIcon}} About the thieves...
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02a 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah, so that's what you uncovered in the end. Hmm, I'm not quite sure how I feel about that.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02a 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But thank you for letting me know.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02a 3.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hearing how things ended almost feels like reading the end of a light novel. Now we can all rest at ease.
::;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the tournament...
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02b 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' "Winning or losing isn't what's most important. It's about playing with elegance." That's how I've always looked at it, anyway.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02b 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' After seeing you all cheering for me though, I suppose I really tried to bring my best to the game.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02b 3.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe... Now that I think about it, it was great that I was able to speak with you before the competition.
::{{DIcon}} Energy +5?
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02b 4.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah! No, please don't ever mention that to anyone!
::;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I'll be on my way, then.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02c 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Since you came all the way to Watatsumi Island, you might as well rest for a moment before you return.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 kokomi 02c 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I hope this view will stay in your heart forever.

===Tighnari===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Tighnari at the [[Teleport Waypoint]] near [[Gandha Hill]])
:{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' {{Traveler}}, what a coincidence! Cyno already told me everything that happened.
:{{DIcon}} About Cyno's unfunny jokes...
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02a 1.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'll stop you right there! Cyno has already told me countless jokes with that smug look on his face. I don't want to hear any more.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02a 2.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That's all I have to say on that topic.
::;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Genius Invokation TCG...
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02b 1.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Things have been quiet in the Avidya Forest lately, so I've been playing with Collei every now and then.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02b 2.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Collei never ceases to amaze me. She even managed to place well in that tournament.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02b 3.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Even though I was able to make it out of the qualifiers, luck wasn't on my side and I faced Cyno only a few matches in.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02b 4.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That guy shows no mercy when it comes to Genius Invokation. He even let out a loud yell when he played the winning card... It really hurt my ears.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02b 5.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It's been a while since I've seen him get so stirred up like that.
::;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I'll be on my way, then.
::{{A|vo dialog dpeq004 tighnari 02c 1.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' No need to be so polite. You should visit again when you have the time.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tighnari, optional)
:{{A|vo dpeq004 10 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' (I really didn't see that coming...)

* The Traveler can ask Kokomi, "Energy +5?" even if they have not yet learned about Kokomi's energy system from [[Dracaena Somnolenta Chapter|her Story Quest]].<!-- you learn about her energy system in Her Secret, but the Energy +5 dialogue and Kokomi's response are available during Watatsumi Sightseeing -->
