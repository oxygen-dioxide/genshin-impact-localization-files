==Dialogue ==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing ''Transient Dreams'')
:'''Jones:''' Darn it. If I knew that this was the case, I wouldn't have taken this job...
:{{DIcon}} What's with the long face?
::'''Jones:''' I'm regretting getting duped into coming to Inazuma.
::'''Jones:''' I was making a living by doing some menial labor at [[Dornman Port]] before this. And then I ran into people from the [[Kanjou Commission]] who were recruiting sailors.
::'''Jones:''' Their supervisor told me that it wouldn't be a tiring gig and that it paid well. I could even travel to Inazuma!
::'''Jones:''' Because of the lockdown now, regular people can't come to Inazuma at all. Only cargo ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission may pass through.
::'''Jones:''' I figured that it might be a good job since I could visit the outside world and make some money. That's why I boarded the ship with them.
::'''Jones:''' Who knew that I would not even have a chance to walk around freely once I got here...
::'''Jones:''' This job is hard and tiring, and I can't even return to Mondstadt if I don't finish the job here! What kind of crap is this?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Jones:''' Goodbye. *sigh* Maybe I could swim back to Mondstadt... Actually, never mind. I don't think that's a good idea.
;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:'''Jones:''' Thanks to be the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]]. I swear I'll never leave Mondstadt again...
:{{DIcon}} Why's that?
::'''Jones:''' Well, it all goes back to Inazuma.
::'''Jones:''' I was making a living by doing some menial labor at Dornman Port before all this. And then I ran into people from the Kanjou Commission who were recruiting sailors.
::'''Jones:''' Their supervisor told me that it wouldn't be a tiring gig and that it paid well. I could even travel to Inazuma!
::'''Jones:''' Back when we were all locked down, regular people couldn't come to Inazuma at all. Only cargo ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission could pass through.
::'''Jones:''' I figured that it might be a good job since I could visit the outside world and make some money. That's why I boarded the ship with them.
::'''Jones:''' But the moment I got there, I was stuck in Ritou, and had to do all kinds of hard, exhausting labor!
::'''Jones:''' So you bet you that last Mora the moment the Sakoku Decree was abolished, I was on the first ship back home.
::'''Jones:''' Thank you, Lord Barbatos, for blowing the winds of freedom toward Inazuma...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Jones:''' Take it from me, friend: Don't go running off to other nations as and when you like!
