==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''Scenes from Life in Meropide: Memories''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Clynes:''' The wise always take orders from fools... Oh, sorry. Did you need something?
:{{DIcon}} Are you an engineer?
::'''Clynes:''' I guess. I'm lucky enough to have the skills needed to make a living here helping the guards fix things.
::'''Clynes:''' I don't know what my former colleagues would think if they saw me now... But I'm happy with the way things are, and that's enough, right?
:{{DIcon}} About the Fortress of Meropide's [[clockwork meka]]...
::'''Clynes:''' The ones found here are all standard models. Not much to say about them. Now, if I were to upgrade them... Ah, why even bother thinking about it?
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing.
::'''Clynes:''' Well then, goodbye.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Scenes from Life in Meropide: Memories''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Clynes:''' We meet again! Great to see you.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been?
::'''Clynes:''' Not good, but not bad either. Which is excellent for me. What about you? Is everything going smoothly lately?
::{{DIcon}} Smooth sailing.
:::'''Clynes:''' I think if it was you, even if you ran into difficulty you'd be able to deal with it without breaking a sweat.
:::'''Clynes:''' Haha. That sounded like I was being sarcastic, didn't it? But I really do think so. You and I are made of completely different stuff, and I can see your quality.
::{{DIcon}} Hard to say...
:::'''Clynes:''' Not so smooth then, it seems. Well, that's unavoidable. If you keep moving forward and face new challenges you have to expect some obstacles and problems along the way.
:::'''Clynes:''' But you have the courage to overcome those obstacles and the wisdom to solve those problems. Any seybacks are merely temporary, right?
:{{DIcon}} About the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]...
::'''Clynes:''' I have nothing to say about that. I'd rather keep my memories about that place and its people to myself.
::'''Clynes:''' I do run into former colleagues here sometimes. But I was never very well-known.
::'''Clynes:''' I don't think they recognize me as a former employee of the Fontaine Research Institute. Which makes life easier for me...
:{{DIcon}} I've got something to do. See you later.
::'''Clynes:''' Hope it goes well.
