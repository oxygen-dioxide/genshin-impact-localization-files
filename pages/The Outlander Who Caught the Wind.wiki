==Summary==
During their travels across the worlds, the [[Traveler]] and their [[Traveler's Sibling|twin sibling]] are confronted by an [[Unknown God|unknown entity]] as they were about to depart. In the ensuing battle, the unknown entity seals off the sibling, before doing the same to the Traveler, sealing their powers and putting both of them in Teyvat.

The Traveler eventually wakes up after an undisclosed amount of time and proceeds to wander across Teyvat, the Traveler is around [[Cape Oath]] when they fish out [[Paimon]] from a lake, thus saving her from drowning. Grateful for the rescue, Paimon becomes their travel companion and guide. She suggests they get in contact with [[Archons|The Seven]] in order to help the Traveler look for their lost sibling.

Making their way to [[Starfell Lake]], the Traveler touches a [[Statue of The Seven|Statue]] of Anemo, they spot a [[Dvalin|green dragon]] heading toward a distant forest.

Upon pursuing the dragon, the pair spot both the dragon and [[Venti|a stranger]], the latter trying to calm the dragon down, but a reaction from the traveler's newfound powers leads to them alerting the dragon to their presence. The stranger also flees, leaving behind a [[Teardrop Crystal|crimson blood colored teardrop crystal]] which the Traveler takes.

Once Paimon and the Traveler leave the forest, the pair are halted by a scout, who introduces herself as the Outrider Knight of [[Knights of Favonius|Favonius]], [[Amber]]. Amber offers to escort them to [[Mondstadt]], the City of Freedom, after she deals with a [[Hilichurls|Hilichurl]] camp nearby, which the traveler and Paimon assist with.

Impressed by their actions at the camp, Amber gifts them a [[Wind Glider]]. But after a test drive, the dragon the Traveler and Paimon had previously sighted, dubbed "Stormterror" by the locals, starts rampaging throughout the region, unleashing multiple wind storms in the process. The Traveler, with the aid of the stranger (albeit unaware of his presence) is able to drive Stormterror off.

The confrontation between the Traveler and Stormterror catches the eye of the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius, [[Kaeya]]; thus he asks the Outlanders to meet the Acting Grandmaster, [[Jean]], at their [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters|primary base of operations]]. Jean asks them to get a handle on the Ley Line disruptions powering Stormterror from three of the Four Winds' Temples, as prescribed by [[Lisa]], the Knights' Librarian.

After dealing with the temples, Paimon suggests that they return to the knights' headquarters to see what they should do next.
