'''Vermeer''' is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Liyue]]. Prior to completing the {{Quest|Luhua Landscape}}, he can be found southwest of [[Luhua Pool]] between two giant statues just above the tide pools. After this quest has been completed, he will move to northeast of the pool, by the ruins near a Teleport Waypoint.

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time after completing the {{Quest|Luhua Landscape}} gives the player the [[Nameless Sketch]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vermeer:''' Hello... Oh! You're the traveler, aren't you!
:'''Vermeer:''' I heard the story about your death-defying battle with [[Dvalin]]!
:{{DIcon}} How's the painting going?
:;(After completing ''Luhua Landscape'')
::'''Vermeer''' I've been painting here at the side of those two statues since their eyes lit up.
::'''Vermeer''' But... How should I say this? I just feel like I haven't been able to paint the perfect picture.
::'''Vermeer''' It just feels like there's something missing, you know what I mean?
::'''Vermeer''' It's like a dish that uses good ingredients and is cooked well, but... but something's just not there...
::'''Vermeer''' I don't know how to express this feeling, and I can't grasp it, either. All I can do is continue to paint.
::'''Vermeer''' Don't worry, you can laugh. Really, all this drawing is making me a little woozy. And I would have taken a short break, too...
::'''Vermeer''' But every time I close my eyes, I can suddenly see the shining eyes of those statues before me. It's as if they've come alive and are staring right at me...
::'''Vermeer''' Which is why I came back here to take a break. I shouldn't be able to see the statues' eyes from here...
::'''Vermeer''' Ah, yes. Why don't you take this painting? It's the best one I've done so far.
::'''Vermeer''' Now, if you don't mind, I'm really tired. I need a break.
::'''Vermeer''' Still, what are my paintings missing... What are they missing...
::;(Obtain {{Item|Nameless Sketch|20|x=1}})
::;(Complete [[Achievement]]{{colon}} [[Shadow Over Luhua Pool]])
:{{DIcon}} You're a Mondstadter?
::'''Vermeer:''' Yes, why so surprised? There are plenty of Mondstadters living in Liyue. I guess the winds of freedom blew us all over this way, haha!
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
::'''Vermeer:''' As you can see, I'm a painter. I believe that wherever you go in the world, no matter how drab a place might seem, you can always find some color if you look closely enough.
::'''Vermeer:''' I consider it my duty to travel all around the seven nations to discover brand new colors and then put them on a canvas for all to see!
::{{DIcon}} Are you looking for inspiration?
::'''Vermeer:''' Yep! I saw this pool and thought, wow, what a magnificent sight!
::'''Vermeer:''' Can't you see why? You've got that cool blue of the water's surface contrasted with the slightly off-white cliff face, interspersed with bits of lush green vegetation... I just want to recreate every last bit of it on the canvas!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Vermeer:''' May the God of Anemo protect you!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Vermeer's name comes from the renowned Dutch painter {{w|Johannes Vermeer}}.
