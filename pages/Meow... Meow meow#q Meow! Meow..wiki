==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Sareh seems to be concerned about her cats...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Sareh, optional)
:'''Sareh:''' (Meow, meow...No, it should be, meow meow meow.)

;(Talk to Sareh)
:'''Sareh:''' Meow&mdash; *cough*...
:{{DIcon}} Uh, what are you doing...?
:'''Sareh:''' I'm looking for my kittens. Normally, they respond to my call.
:'''Sareh:''' Is my pronunciation off today somehow? I've been calling them for ages, and none of them have answered. How strange...
:{{DIcon}} Can't you just call their names?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. Don't people usually call kittens' names when looking for them, right?
::'''Sareh:''' But if you call for them in our language, they can't understand it, can they?
:{{DIcon}} What did you mean by "your pronunciation today" being off, anyway?
::'''Sareh:''' Well, I was calling their names, actually, just in the language of cats.
::'''Sareh:''' After all, they wouldn't necessarily understand if we called them in our language, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Well, you do have a point there...
:'''Sareh:''' Still, I'm getting nowhere shouting myself hoarse like this.
:'''Sareh:''' Traveler, I'd like to ask you a serious question.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me...
:{{DIcon}} The payment should be...
:'''Sareh:''' ...Would you like to learn the language of cats?
:{{DIcon}} What?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Paimon:''' You mean you're gonna teach us how to talk to cats?
:;(If the player has met [[Neko]])
:::{{DIcon}} Well, I've spoken to cats before...
:::'''Paimon:''' You mean Neko? But she can speak our language. That doesn't really count as "cat-talk"...
:'''Sareh:''' Indeed. Still, in exchange, you will need to help me find a cat.
:{{DIcon}} No problem.
:{{DIcon}} Looks like each city has its unique way of looking for cats...
::'''Paimon:''' Heh, that's true! If you think about it, we've helped people find cats in quite a few cities by now...
::'''Paimon:''' Should we say that everyone just loves cats, or that everyone who owns a cat has the same problem?
:'''Sareh:''' So you agree? Why, thank you so much!
<!--:'''Sareh:''' Ahem... Now, listen carefully. This is the outline of cat language that I've been working on for a long time.-->

;(Talk to Sareh)
:;(If the player receives the Lale Version)
:::'''Sareh:''' The one that has slipped out today is a black and white cat called "Lale."
:::'''Sareh:''' In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow, meow meow meow, meeeeow!"
:::'''Sareh:''' Keep in mind how the tone falls and then rises again. Make sure that the last "meow" is very high.
:::'''Sareh:''' Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Please wait just a moment.
:;(If the player receives the Nargis Version)
:::'''Sareh:''' The one that has slipped out for snacks today is a dark gray cat called "Nargis."
:::'''Sareh:''' In cat language, you should call for it like this... "Meow! Meow meow, meow."
:::'''Sareh:''' Remember to stress the first meow and say the following ones quickly.
:::'''Sareh:''' Hmm... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment.
:;(If the player receives the Rozan Version)
:::'''Sareh:''' The one that has slipped out for a date today is a gray and black striped cat called "Rozan."
:::'''Sareh:''' In cat language, you would call for it by saying... "Meow meow meow, meow meow meow."
:::'''Sareh:''' Both sets of meows are quick sounds, so make sure you don't drawl.
:::'''Sareh:''' Actually... Let me write a note for you. Wait just a moment, will you?
:{{Black Screen|Sareh starts to write some notes...}}
:'''Sareh:''' Thank you very much, Traveler. I'll be waiting for you here.
:'''Sareh:''' I hope that your talk with the cat goes well.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Sareh's Note}})

;(Talk to Sareh again)
:'''Sareh:''' Do you have any further questions, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} Could you help me with the cat's name in their language...
::'''Sareh:''' That's on the note I wrote for you. Please refer to it if your memory fails you.
:{{DIcon}} You don't seem too worried about them.
::'''Sareh:''' Well, people in town love the cats. They often play with them and feed them.
::'''Sareh:''' I'm just hoping that they don't eat too much and get overweight.
----
;(Approach the cat)
:'''Paimon:''' Listen, Paimon thinks there's a cat meowing. It must be somewhere around here. Let's take a closer look.

:{{DIcon}} Meow, meow meow meow, meeeeow! <small>''(Correct answer)''</small>
::'''Lale:''' Meow, meow meow, meow meow meow.
::{{Black Screen|Lale jumps into your arms.}}
::'''Paimon:''' Wow! That was quick! Looks like it worked...
:{{DIcon}} Meow! Meow meow, meow.
::'''Lale:''' Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow!
::{{Black Screen|Lale turns around and runs away.}}
::'''Paimon:''' It doesn't sound happy... Did you pronounce its name wrongly?
:{{DIcon}} Meow meow meow, meow meow meow.
::'''Lale:''' Meow? Meow? Meow? Meow!
::{{Black Screen|Lale turns around and runs away.}}
::'''Paimon:''' It doesn't sound happy... Did you pronounce its name wrongly?

::'''Nargis:''' Meow? Meow meow meow...
::{{Black Screen|Nargis turns around and jumps into a pile of things nearby...}}
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Why did it leave? Did you pronounce its name wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Meow! Meow meow, meow. <small>''(Correct answer)''</small>
::'''Nargis:''' Meow! meow meow meow&mdash;
::{{Black Screen|Nargis jumps on your shoulder and... Wow, it sure is heavy!}}
::'''Paimon:''' This cat's pretty agile for a glutton...
:{{DIcon}} Meow meow meow, meow meow meow.
::'''Nargis:''' Meow? Meow meow meow...
::{{Black Screen|Nargis turns around and jumps into a pile of things nearby...}}
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Why did it leave? Did you pronounce its name wrong?

===Rozan Version===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Rozan)
:'''Rozan:''' Meow?
:'''Paimon:''' It's your turn to meow, {{Traveler}}! Come on, you can do it!
:{{DIcon}} Meow, meow meow meow, meow&mdash;
::'''Rozan:''' Meow... Meow meow, meow.
::{{Black Screen|Rozan shakes its head indifferently and leaves...}}
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why did the kitty leave?
::{{DIcon}} Did I pronounce something wrong?
::'''Paimon:''' Does it mean "I'm not the cat you're looking for"?
::'''Paimon:''' This cat sure does have a personality...
:{{DIcon}} Meow! Meow meow, meow.
::'''Rozan:''' Meow... Meow meow, meow.
::{{Black Screen|Rozan shakes its head indifferently and leaves...}}
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why did the kitty leave?
::{{DIcon}} Did I pronounce something wrong?
::'''Paimon:''' Does it mean "I'm not the cat you're looking for"?

:{{DIcon}} Meow meow meow, meow meow meow. <small>''(Correct answer)''</small>
::'''Rozan:''' Meow, meow meow.
::{{Black Screen|Rozan nods gently...}}
::'''Paimon:''' So... it's willing to go with us?
::'''Paimon:''' What a polite cat...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ending===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sareh)
:;(If the player succeeded)
:::'''Sareh:''' Oh, you brought the kitten back. Thank you so much.
:::'''Sareh:''' Well, it looks like you are doing pretty well with cat-talk.
:::'''Sareh:''' Here, please take this as compensation.
:::'''Sareh:''' There aren't many people who can pick up cat language this fast. You know... I could even use your help in the future.
:::{{DIcon}} Meow!
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey, you can speak normally. Ms. Sareh is not a cat!
:::'''Sareh:''' I can see from your face that you were trying to say "my pleasure," but your pronunciation still has room for improvement, I think.
:::'''Sareh:''' It's okay though. I'll keep teaching you about cat language. We'll learn together!
:;(If the player failed)
:::'''Sareh:''' Eh? You didn't find the cat?
:::{{Black Screen|You tell Sareh what happened...}}
:::'''Sareh:''' Is that so? Well, it's okay. Cat language is not easy for beginners, after all.
:::'''Sareh:''' I'll go find them myself later. Still, thank you for the trouble. Please take these as your payment, Traveler.
