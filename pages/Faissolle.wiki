==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->Faissolle is a member of the [[Beret Society]], and [[Avice]] is his lover. In order to investigate the Beret Society, Wriothesley steals Faissolle's hat. Faissolle then freaks out and hides in a box, asking the Traveler to help find his hat.

When they meet [[Dougier]], the Beret Society members find out that Faissolle lost his hat. He then came under the scrutiny of the Beret Society. 

Avice then rushed to talk with Wriothesley and the Traveler at a safe time, giving info to reveal the secrets of the Beret Society. She removed her hat and gave her hairpin to the Traveler and Wriothesley. They discover the hairpin contained a thorn that could inject [[Aqua Doloris]] (liquid "fear") to make people experience unpleasant memories, similar to the effects of touching the dark stone Wriothesley found earlier.

In the end, Faissolle and Avice get married and ask Wriothesley to help them host the wedding in Meropide.
