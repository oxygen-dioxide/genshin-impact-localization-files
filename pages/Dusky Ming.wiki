'''Dusky Ming''' {{Lang|zh=小冥|zh_rm=Xiǎo Míng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Wangshu}}.

==Profile==
According to [[Uncle Ghast]], in the distant past, Dusky Ming succumbed to a fatal illness when she was a child, leaving her mother greatly bereaved. For whatever reason, Dusky Ming's spirit remained in the mortal world. She prepared food for her mother and even brought her to a nearby [[hilichurl]] camp where she was promptly surrounded. Instead of attacking, however, the hilichurls began dancing Dusky Ming's favorite dance &mdash; the girl had befriended the hilichurls from the afterlife.

Some time later, [[Xiao]] came across Dusky Ming. Seeing she was harmless yet unable to move on, he asked [[Verr Goldet]] and [[Huai'an]] if she could move into the [[Wangshu Inn]] for a while, where she spent her time spooking visitors as entertainment. However, the inn's cook, [[Smiley Yanxiao]], had not been notified of this and became terrified when Ming began messing around in the kitchen, refusing to cook. The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] chase Ming, who then possesses a [[Ruin Hunter]]. After disabling it, she promises not to haunt the inn in return for them being her playmates.

===Appearance===
Dusky Ming is the spirit of a young girl. She has black braided-hair and black eyes, and wears a traditional Liyue dress.

==Trivia==
* [[Qiqi]] has a [[Qiqi/Voice-Overs|Voice-Over]] line about Dusky Ming, in which she senses that Dusky Ming is doing stretches with her, but the zombie is unable to see the ghost.
** This currently makes her the first NPC who is specifically mentioned by a playable character through their voice-over.
* Dusky Ming is also alluded to in a message on the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board#About Dusky Ming...|Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]].
* [[Little Yi]] claims to have met Dusky Ming, suggesting that she has wandered over to [[Qingce Village]] in the past.
* The song that Dusky Ming likes singing is [[Hu Tao]]'s "Hilitune," suggesting that she has either met the funeral director personally, or overheard it on her ghostly travels around Liyue and took a liking to it.
