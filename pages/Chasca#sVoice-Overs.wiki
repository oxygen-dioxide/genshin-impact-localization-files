Hmm? Me? No, I'm not arrogant. Just supremely confident.

I honestly don't know how things would've gone down without you there.<br>She's nowhere near as hostile toward humans anymore, but it'll still take her some time to get used to them. Old habits die hard.<br>[[Chime]], on the other hand? Loves hanging out with the tribe. She gets along really well with [[Yatlan]] and the other kids... Heh, watching them play together, it sometimes reminds me of me and Coya when we were little.<br>Anyway, now [[Chimpu|Mom]]'s the one being difficult... I don't know what's gotten into her recently. She keeps nagging me to build a nest of my own like Coya. And she's all, "maybe it's time to expand your family even further"... Where is all this coming from? ...Hmm? What are you smiling about?

|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = People often find it embarrassing to open up about their childhood mistakes... Why is that? Whether you're a human or a Qucusaur, you can only grow by learning from your past mistakes.<br>That's why I'm not shy about my history of mindlessly lashing out as a kid. Nowadays, I never draw my gun without thinking it through first, even if just for a couple of seconds... or maybe a half second.

|vo_08_02_tx         = Mualani says we got into a fight as kids over some toy we both wanted, but I don't remember any of that.<br>Hmm... I wonder if it's because I got into so many fights that I just lost track of them all? I also wonder if it was actually her surfboard I was after, rather than a toy... I'll bet I just wanted the ability to go hunting on water.<br>Heh, whatever it was, I doubt our feud lasted more than a day. It never does with Mualani.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Mualani

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Xilonen]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Xilonen.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = She might come across as low-energy, but make no mistake &mdash; she's one of the most diligent people you'll ever meet.<br>When I asked her to build my gun for me, I barely put any thought into it, just gave her a general idea of what I wanted, and left it with her. Then, once she started working on it in earnest, she spent an entire day questioning me &mdash; what would a typical day's flying look like, how often I was expecting to use it, and so on &mdash; and by the end of the day, there were abandoned designs schemes all over the floor... I was so exhausted that I fell asleep even before she did.<br>Then she wrote a whole maintenance guide, which she forced me to learn by heart so I wouldn't come bugging her with issues every day... Well, that's what she said. But I suspect her real reason was that she wanted to make sure I'd look after myself and fly safe.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Xilonen

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Mavuika]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Mavuika.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Some people compare me to the Pyro Archon because of my track record in the [[Pilgrimage]]. It's a meaningless comparison. If the Pilgrimage was a tree, and I was a vulture on the highest branch, then the Pyro Archon would be the sun in the sky... The stronger you get, the more you appreciate the sheer size of the gulf between you and her. I just won a few championships &mdash; she's the champion of an entire era.<br>But at least being on top with a clear view of the sky means I can see exactly how high I want to fly from here.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Mavuika

|vo_08_05_tx         = When I first saw [[Ajaw]], I thought "Oh, Kinich has a [[saurian]] he treats like family, too"... Blissfully unaware of how far off the mark I was. Their relationship is... truly one-of-a-kind.<br>Although I will say, Ajaw's mastery of the human language makes me pretty envious. I wish mom could talk like that, too, so we could do away with the whole body-language-based guesswork-game.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Kinich, Ajaw, Chimpu

|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Citlali.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = My dad told me that when I was little, they gathered all of the most learned elders in Natlan and asked them to come up with a plan for managing my Abyss condition. They all disagreed on the best approach, and it turned into a drawn-out debate. At some point, Citlali quietly left the room, but they were all too busy arguing to notice. When she got back, she put some food and wine down in front of her, ignored everyone, and just started eating... the table suddenly went very quiet.<br>Just by looking at her, you'd never know how much seniority and experience she has.

|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Ifa.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Chuychu and my dad have discussed medicine with him countless times. So after I got back from the airborne workshop, the first thing I did was take Coya to get checked out by him. But he seemed so dismissive &mdash; he took one glance, said "it's nothing serious, [[Cusco]] can handle it," and then immediately left to deal with another patient... *sigh* He was right, of course. I was just worrying too much.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Ifa, Chuychu, Cusco

|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Iansan.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = I've always felt that training oneself and training others are two very different skillsets. Very few people have them both, but Iansan has them in spades.<br>I, for one, am not very good at teaching other people. Whenever I'm trying to demonstrate something to the flying squad, I spend forever trying to explain some basic, boring detail that seems intuitive to me... only to have everyone ask, "What's intuitive about that!?"<br>If only Iansan could tutor them, I bet we'd have twice as many candidates pass the flying trials each year... Shame that her training program doesn't include flying.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Iansan

|vo_09_02_tx         = The warriors of the Flower-Feather Clan are a proud bunch, but the Qucusaurs are a prouder bunch still. Anyone who aspires to become a Rider has to train relentlessly and then win their approval &mdash; even me, and I was practically one of them growing up. It's only fair, though. Allowing a rookie to ride a Qucusaur into the skies would be highly irresponsible for both the Qucusaur and the Rider.

|vo_09_03_tx         = Sometimes, after failing the flying trials countless times and never winning the Qucusaurs' approval, people lose all their motivation and decide to call it quits. In the Flower-Feather Clan, we call those people the "Wingless"... But generally, only the most outstanding warriors even attempt the flying trials in the first place. Their fighting spirit may have faded out, but it will one day burn again. And until that day comes, we will quietly watch over them, just as the Qucusaurs watch over their unfledged young.

Behind me, I have my saurian family, my human family, and every other creature in the family we call Natlan. So I will not be defeated. Not by the Abyss, and not by life's hardships.

I have to stay strong, for her sake...<br>But when the relic exploded, and Coya dove in front of me, I... the same fear of losing my sister came flooding back again...<br>Sorry, I just don't really know who I can talk to about this kind of stuff. I usually push it to the back of my mind... But I feel much better now.<br>Since I can't forget that fear, I guess I'll try the opposite: remember it, own it. And eventually... transcend it.

That was a whistling birthday firework. I made it myself!<br>Hmm? ...What are the other five rounds? More fireworks, of course!
