:'''Jami:''' Agh! If only I'd known this would happen, I'd have just applied to join [[Spantamad]] at matriculation!
:'''Jami:''' So, (Traveler), how's the research going...?
:{{DIcon}} About your mentor...
::'''Jami:''' My mentor's just awful! I've made up my mind. If I get to finish my research in time, I shall stand on his desk and slap him with my draft manuscript!
::'''Jami:''' Or so I wish... I am grateful to him, though. He's been strict, yes. But it's for our own good. I know that much.
:{{DIcon}} About the "Fayz Potion"...
::'''Jami:''' I don't have any more of it. I gave all I had to you, and it would be a pain to make more...
::'''Jami:''' You know, I did always think that there were maybe two steps too many in the production process. I omitted them this time, and the result seems to actually have improved...
::'''Jami:''' Eh? Why didn't I make that my research topic instead...? ... Agh!
::'''Jami:''' Curses! There's... there's no time to change topics now, is there!?
:{{DIcon}} I'm still working on it...
::'''Jami:''' I'll leave you to them, then. Good luck!
