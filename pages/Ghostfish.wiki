'''Ghostfish''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Enkanomiya]].

They are floating schools of fish that will surround the player when the player [[gliding|glides]] into them, allowing them to continuously glide. Keep within the group to prevent the added lift from being lost. In the World Quest ''[[The Three Great Martial Trials]]'', they are notably found around [[The Emanant Skylight|Emanant Skylights]].
