'''Ghostfish''' are schools of fish in the air found in [[Enkanomiya]]. They will surround the player when the player glides into the fish, allowing them to continuously glide. Keep within the group to prevent the added lift from being lost. In the World Quest, [[The Three Great Martial Trials]], they are notably found around [[The Emanant Skylight|Emanant Skylights]].
