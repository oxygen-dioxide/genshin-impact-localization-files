{{Quote|A mysterious person who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, but is a "non-entity" on the Ministry of Civil Affairs' List.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Yelan is said to be quite secretive and mysterious; while claiming to work for the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]], she's frequently absent from work most of the year. Despite this, [[Ningguang]] tolerates her general absence while [[Keqing]] appreciates her work, although the latter wonders as to where she gets her intelligence from. She employs psychological tactics to catch her targets and get all the information she needs from them.

Outside of work, Yelan approaches life at a calm and carefree pace. She frequently enjoys napping whenever possible, but will adjust her schedule as needed for the day's tasks. When handling particularly troublesome cases, she tries to save up her energy to complete everything in a single go.

In the presence of others, she is said to be very pleasant and polite. When alone, she's said to show a far different side of her as an extremely reliable, powerful and intelligent woman. She also has a high tolerance for spice, eating raw or dried [[Jueyun Chili]]s after deeming [[Xiangling]]'s spiciest dish not enough for her. She dislikes sweets, claiming that they're too easy to get addicted to and disrupts focus.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Yelan is a tall woman with dark blue hair and asymmetrical bangs that are lighter at the tips and light emerald-green eyes. Yelan also sports a pair of white blue-tipped earrings resembling teardrops.

Yelan's attire consists of a dark bodysuit embellished with silver details and a blue overcoat. Her attire is decorated with a number of trinkets and accessories, including white bracelets on her arms and a number of chokers and necklaces around her neck from which a charm resembling a die hangs. In addition to this, Yelan keeps a furred white coat hanging from the back of her outfit somewhat resembling a cape and sports a pair of thigh-high boots that leave a part of her thigh exposed, where her Hydro [[Vision]] is attached.

{{Quote|Oh, you're looking for Yelan? Hmm, I'd like to suggest that you treat her as an ordinary person, but if you do, it's easy to lose control over negotiations. There are some things that really depend on her impression of you.|[[Yanfei]]}}
Yelan's identity has always been a mystery.

Like a phantom, she often appears in various guises at the center of events, and disappears before the storm stops.

The people who are caught up in trouble look forward to meeting her. For some reason, most of them think she will help them, and if not, they want her to be their ally.

But the problem is, their opponents harbor the same idea.

Every one of these people has met a Yelan who goes by a different name and identity, and each of them thinks they can reach a partnership with her. However, everyone has been kept in the dark.

Who does she want to help? When will she tell the truth?

Once she acts and intervenes, nothing can be trusted.

When she reveals her true identity and speaks the truth, those who are eager for answers may not have the chance to hear it.

But before the storms can come to an end, she has already disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Sometimes, she will pick a side in some conflict to offer her help, but those who receive her aid would be fools to celebrate prematurely, for they soon find that the same help has been extended to their opponents.</p><p>Having stepped into her trap, many have vowed to take revenge, yet none are able to tell what she is planning, let alone know where she stands.</p><p>Many believe that she is a spy who works for some mysterious organization, and that her forte is stirring things up in the dark, which she then relies on to attain what she wants.</p><p>Some even go as far as saying that she is a frenetic follower of disorder who neither serves any organization nor holds any meaningful purposes.</p><p>Even if she does, all she wants is to add fuel to the already spreading flame and drag everyone down into a world of madness created by her.</p><p>With so many theories and guesses circulating, she has become a mystery.

A master in this art, she always manages to avoid attention.</p><p>As for the wounds on her person, these are the inevitable result of her constant exposure to danger from mission to mission.</p><p>Despite the curious job, Yelan herself is not very curious about the world.</p><p>She eats, sleeps, and lives just like everyone else, but few things can really pique her interest.</p><p>She is well-read, but she is no avid reader. She always knows what to say to achieve the best result, yet she takes no pleasure in playing mind games.</p><p>She travels far and roams the lands, yet the traveling and roaming are bland to her.</p><p>In Yelan's eyes, these things are not hobbies, but a means to an end.</p><p>She even prefers to roll the dice to decide how she will pass the time.</p><p>Just as someone who is so used to spicy food might lose the ability to enjoy ordinary dishes, Yelan finds that only spicy cuisine can bring her satisfaction.</p><p>"Blandness is synonymous with blindness, while thrills afford clarity."</p><p>Acting upon said philosophy, she chooses an acute style of life, venturing into many places while hiding in the shadows.</p><p>She dances with danger, secrets, and a strong sense of achievement &mdash; these are the vivid proof of her existence.</p>

The way she sees it, she is not so much working for Ningguang as making good on her end of the deal, or rather... she is honoring a certain pact.</p><p>She plucks the fruits of intelligence from the tree of danger for Ningguang, and in return, all she asks for is danger itself and the sense of achievement.</p><p>None know when their collaboration began.</p><p>The only thing certain is that Yelan has long made her presence felt in lands outside Liyue.</p><p>From other nations in [[Teyvat]] to even the perilous [[Abyss]]...</p><p>Every secret and perilous demesne shall become a garden where orchids bloom.</p><p>Stealthily she roams the night, stars shining upon her in the skies.</p>

|text7         = <p>Throughout Yelan's intelligence career so far, there has been one memorable operation that fuses both failure and success together.</p><p>One could say that it was a failure because she lost a family heirloom named the "Fascinating Bracelet" during that operation.</p><p>The inside of the jade bracelet is engraved with a spell passed through her line that turns the heirloom into a simple communication device. However, the spell requires a pair of such vessels to work. Now that only one bracelet is left, it is no more than a mere accessory.</p><p>However, the operation also proved a success for Yelan because her enemy did not get the upper hand, either. And this enemy of hers was no ordinary character &mdash; it was none other than "[[Regrator]]," Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers.</p><p>Yelan infiltrated a secret trade route that was run by Regrator behind the scenes, intercepting the goods and picking the most precious one of them as compensation for her bracelet.</p><p>Now, there once existed a strange mystical beast in times of old. A robe made from its fur would be worth a fortune, and due to its rarity, such a robe is exceptionally hard to procure.</p><p>In fact, the beast is so powerful that although it died centuries ago, its body remains intact today, and its fur still emits a mysterious fragrance.</p><p>Regrator had intended it as an offer to the [[Tsaritsa]], yet Yelan unexpectedly intercepted it.</p><p>Not only that, she also rejected the style that Snezhnayans had chosen for their Tsaritsa &mdash; she yanked the fur off, combined it with Liyue's Ramie yarn, and made a rather fashionable sleeved mantle for herself.</p><p>This series of happenings could be seen as significant or insignificant &mdash; depending on one's perspective. Ultimately, it all boils down to three words: gains and losses.</p><p>The cycle of gaining and losing is a rather accurate summary of Yelan's life.</p><p>None of that really bothers her though.

For the first time in her life, she stopped, for a long, long time.</p><p>This state of affairs persisted until one day, when Ningguang visited her in her wood hut personally.</p><p>"You haven't been back to Liyue Harbor for a while.

All postures, aggressive or defensive, are all means to an end, anyway."</p><p>There was no response, but only a suffocating silence.

Like lightning it shot into the skies, piercing through clouds with might that could shatter the dome of heaven itself. As if responding to the call of an unknown power, waters in the mountains growled and howled, then swirled their way upward in the form of countless arrows.</p><p>When they met halfway in the sky, they exploded into a curtain of water, bringing down a squalling shower like those that adorned summer nights.</p><p>As the sky cleared, there was no rainbow, no butterflies to be seen, only a faint pillar of light that fell into Yelan's palm.</p><p>According to Ningguang, the Vision carries a message: "From today onward, leave all matters to the extraordinary Yelan."</p>
