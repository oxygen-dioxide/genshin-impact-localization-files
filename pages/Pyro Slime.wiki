{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Ignited State
|desc_1 = While in the ignited state, the Pyro Slime will be inflicted with the {{Pyro}} status indefinitely. Triggering certain [[Elemental Reactions]] on a Pyro Slime will extinguish it.
* 1 [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge]] of {{Hydro}}, 2 gauges of {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}, or 4 gauges of {{Anemo}}/{{Geo}} must be applied to extinguish the Pyro Slime.
* Additionally, every time the Pyro Slime takes {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, it will immediately reignite, regardless of the amount of Pyro gauges applied or the amount of DMG dealt. Therefore, due to the [[Swirl]] and [[Overloaded]] reactions' ability to deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, {{Anemo}} or {{Electro}} on their own are unable to fully extinguish it.

|name_2 = Bump
|desc_2 = Bumps into the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} while ignited or {{Color|Physical DMG}} while extinguished.

|name_3 = Final Burst
|desc_3 = When defeated in the ignited state, explodes after a short delay, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}.

|name_4 = Reignition
|desc_4 = While extinguished, retreats away from the player until it reignites after a period of time.
