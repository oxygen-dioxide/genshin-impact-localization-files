==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Ignited State:''' While in the ignited state, the Pyro Slime will be inflicted with the {{Pyro}} status indefinitely. Triggering certain [[Elemental Reactions]] on a Pyro Slime will extinguish it.
**1 [[Gauge Unit Theory|gauge]] of {{Hydro}}, 2 gauges of {{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}, or 4 gauges of {{Anemo}}/{{Geo}} must be applied to extinguish the Pyro Slime.
**Additionally, every time the Pyro Slime takes {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, it will immediately reignite, regardless of the amount of Pyro gauges applied or the amount of DMG dealt. Therefore, due to the [[Swirl]] and [[Overloaded]] reactions' ability to deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, {{Anemo}} or {{Electro}} on their own are unable to fully extinguish it.
*'''Bump:''' Bumps into the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} while ignited or {{Color|Physical DMG}} while extinguished.
*'''Final Burst:''' When defeated in the ignited state, explodes after a short delay, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}.
*'''Reignition:''' While extinguished, retreats away from the player until it reignites after a period of time.
