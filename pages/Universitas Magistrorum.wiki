The '''Universitas Magistrorum''' was a [[Khaenri'ah]]n organization whose members dabbled in various arts, including astrology and alchemy. Its situation since the Kingdom of Khaenri'ah's destruction during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago is unknown.

Most information on the Universitas Magistrorum currently comes from the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]]'s research and extrapolation. The organization appears to have been rather influential in Khaenri'ahn society and covered an array of different functions. Based on [[Jakob]]'s [[??? (Fontaine)#Log|Log]], alchemy was among the Universitas' areas of expertise, although he believed [[Rene]] would criticize the Universitas for "neglecting the fundamental principles underlying everything" and "invert[ing] even the alchemical stages for other purposes."

In ''[[Perinheri]]'', a legend set during [[Teyvat]]'s [[Archon War]] and Khaenri'ah's [[Crimson Moon Dynasty]], the Universitas' strongest warrior at the time was an individual named Alf,<ref name="Perinheri 2">{{Ref/Book|Perinheri|2}}</ref> suggesting the Universitas also had combatants.
