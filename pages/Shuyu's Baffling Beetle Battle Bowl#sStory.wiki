{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Grandmaster Hanakado and Shuyu)
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Master Shuyu!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' As you can see, I have successfully directed Bloom Pruner: Radiant Wings to victory over the final foe of "Shuyu's Baffling Beetle Battle Bowl"...
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Could you now impart upon me some fundamentals of the mechanical arts...?
:'''Shuyu:''' Okay, okay, don't rush...
:'''Shuyu:''' You'll need a foundation in mathematics and engineering if you want to study the mechanical arts, so let me find you some textbooks and give you a couple more sets of test questions.
:'''Shuyu:''' Actually, hang on a moment. How did the Beetle Battle get named after me, again?
:'''Shuyu:''' I've heard about the previous iterations of the event. Weren't they all named after your big bro [[Itto]]?
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' That is how things used to be, yes, but considering the Oni King's personality, he'd likely say&mdash;
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' "Bloom Pruner's my nemesis, a foe I must defeat! Any tournament with my name on it has gotta have Crimson Staff take center stage!"
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Besides, it was thanks to you that this mystical beetle battle trial could be implemented at all, Master Shuyu, so of course your name should be on it!
:'''Shuyu:''' Well, I wouldn't call myself much more than a middleman, passing your requests onto Master [[Xianyun]] and Madame [[Ping]] &mdash; they're the ones you should be thanking.
:'''Shuyu:''' Of course, you don't have to send anything like that Semi-Automatic Tea Grinder... or whatever it was called, alright?
:'''Shuyu:''' First, we wouldn't want you to break the bank for our sakes, and second, neither Master Xianyun nor Madame Ping really drinks much matcha in the first place.
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Understood! Next time, I'll be sure to select a gift that better suits Master of Masters Xianyun and Adeptus Ping!
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;Is Paimon still asleep or something... Is Grandmaster Hanakado seriously having a discussion about "Masters" and "mechanics" with Xianyun's disciple, Shuyu?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's going back to bed.
:{{DIcon}} No, it's not just you, Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, and who's Grandmaster Hanakado again?
:'''Shuyu:''' Huh, that sounds like... Is that you, {{Traveler}}, Paimon?
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Oh, if it isn't the Oni King's Right Hand and Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon! Well met, well met!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' In case you've forgotten my humble person, allow me to introduce myself...
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' We have crossed paths before, during the [[Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl]] and the [[Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp]].
:{{DIcon}} Oh, right, you're one of Itto's subordinates.
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, yeah, Paimon remembers too! We beat you during the first big beetle battle, and you became one of Itto's advisors after that, helping him challenge a [[Geovishap Hatchling]] with his [[Onikabuto]]!
:{{DIcon}} That happened, did it? Mind continuing the introductions?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon sorta remembers... We beat you during the first big beetle battle, and you became one of Itto's advisors after that, helping him challenge a Geovishap Hatchling with his Onikabuto!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' That's right, and at the end of that great training arc, [[Guoba]]-san brought Adeptus Cloud Retainer's Bloom Pruner. That sure was a gap in ability if I've ever seen one...
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' To rise to greater beetle-battling heights, the Oni King and I agreed to stay in Liyue and prepare suitable gifts to show our sincerity as we seek to learn from the adepti.
:{{DIcon}} Looks like you've succeeded. Congratulations.
:{{DIcon}} [[Adeptus]] Shuyu&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, nice, Adeptus Shuyu!
:'''Shuyu:''' N&mdash;No, I'm not really an official teacher just yet. Grandmaster Hanakado just insists on calling me that.
:'''Shuyu:''' Never mind being at the level of an adeptus... I'm not even close to making "half-adeptus"! It just so happens that Master taught me some of the basic principles of mechanics recently.
:'''Shuyu:''' She believes that people of similar ages communicate better with one another, and that teaching Grandmaster Hanakado will also help to reinforce my own learning.
:'''Shuyu:''' So for now, I'll be the one teaching him the basics, while at the same time, really getting a grasp on the specific mechanical fields he wants to learn about.
:'''Paimon:''' Specific areas of learning, huh... Hmm, let Paimon guess. Does this have something to do with the Serenitea Pot-like furnishing on the table?
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' That's right! Adeptus Cloud Retainer and Adeptus Ping fashioned that masterpiece after hearing Master Shuyu's explanation. A truly amazing masterwork, believe you me!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' It's got all sorts of... monsters I'd never have dared get close to normally inside &mdash; though with the newly-equipped Bloom Pruner at full output, I could take them on head-to-head!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' And to show my respect, I'd like to name this "Shuyu's Baffling Beetle Battle Bowl"!
:'''Shuyu:''' ...Uh, I still think you should name this after Xianyu&mdash; Master Cloud Retainer or Madame Ping instead...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, so this teapot's got monsters inside, and you can fight them using Onikabuto?
:{{DIcon}} That sounds... somewhat dangerous?
::'''Paimon:''' That's true, but bull-chucker seems to like this kinda thing... and y'know, Paimon gets where he's coming from.
:{{DIcon}} Well, now that sounds interesting!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon knew you'd be fired up about this... Well, she can't blame you for being excited, Paimon wants to try it out, too!
:'''Shuyu:''' Actually, this is an annex of an adeptal realm that Master split off to improve Bloom Pruner's gardening functions.
:'''Shuyu:''' The monsters inside are all targets created using adeptal energy, and will act in set ways similar to those of the creatures they're based on. Their combat abilities aren't anywhere close to the originals, though...
:'''Shuyu:''' Bloom Pruner would struggle to deal with opponents that many times its size, even at full power.
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' W&mdash;Wait, so they're just simulated?
:'''Shuyu:''' Well, the point here is to familiarize you with the operating logic behind devices like Bloom Pruner. In that sense, understanding its performance limits is also very important.
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Perhaps my beetle battling skills are the limiting factor here. The Oni King said so too: "How can you talk about performance when you don't know the first thing about fighting"?
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Good thing you're here, Oni King's Right Hand, Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' With your help, I'm sure I'll be able to see what Bloom Pruner can really do. I'm willing to pay for your services, of course...
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' And for your part, you'll get to experience new and exciting battles!
:'''Shuyu:''' Hmm... I've never seen you in a beetle battle before, {{Traveler}}... Now I'm getting curious...
:{{DIcon}} Alright! Time to become the best beetle battlemaster!
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' You've always been one!
::'''Paimon:''' P&mdash;P&mdash;Paimon's really strong too!
:{{DIcon}} Let's do some fact-finding for Itto first...
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' If the opportunity arises, I'll also write a letter to the Oni King to report on our current progress. I'll be sure to mention the generous aid you've offered!
::'''Paimon:''' Heh, for all we know, he might just buy a boat ticket to bolt over here and try this new beetle battle before we can blink!
:'''Paimon:''' Well then, there's no time to lose! {{Traveler}}, let's plumb the depths of "Shuyu's Baffling Beetle Battle Bowl"!
:'''Shuyu:''' I guess I'll just... have to accept this name, won't I?

:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Understood! Next time, I'll be sure to select a gift that better suits Master of Masters Xianyun and Adeptus Ping!
:'''Paimon:''' No wonder there were beetle-fighting challenges for us within that adeptal-realm-like Domain. It's all because of the expert beetle battler, Grandmaster Hanakado.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers that he played against Itto some time back, didn't he? Why'd he come all the way here to [[Mt. Aocang]]?
:{{DIcon}} He chose to stay in Liyue back then, didn't he?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, and who's Grandmaster Hanakado again?
:'''Shuyu:''' Huh, that sounds like... Is that you, {{Traveler}}, Paimon?
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Oh, if it isn't the Oni King's Right Hand and Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon! Well met, well met!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' In case you've forgotten my humble person, allow me to introduce myself...
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' We have crossed paths before, during the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl and the Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp.

:'''Shuyu:''' So for now, I'll be the one teaching him the basics, while at the same time, really getting a grasp on the specific mechanical fields he wants to learn about.
:'''Paimon:''' Specific fields of study... Hmm, then that Serenitea Pot-like furnishing on the table, and the Onikabuto... trial against powerful opponents... They're all related!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' That's right! Adeptus Cloud Retainer and Adeptus Ping fashioned that masterpiece after hearing Master Shuyu's explanation. A truly amazing masterwork, believe you me!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' It's got all sorts of... monsters I'd never have dared get close to normally inside &mdash; though with the newly-equipped Bloom Pruner at full output, I could take them on head-to-head!
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' And to show my respect, I'd like to name this "Shuyu's Baffling Beetle Battle Bowl"!
:'''Shuyu:''' ...Uh, I still think you should name this after Xianyu&mdash; Master Cloud Retainer or Madame Ping instead...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, now that Paimon thinks about it, letting an Onikabuto go up against monsters certainly could give you results you can't get from ordinary beetle battles!
:{{DIcon}} Such battles might be somewhat outside an ordinary Onikabuto's purview...
::'''Paimon:''' True, but Bloom Pruner isn't your run-of-the-mill Onikabuto! It'll be fine.
:{{DIcon}} The fights were pretty interesting, I've gotta say!
::'''Paimon:''' Right? Even Paimon wants to go for another round!
:'''Shuyu:''' Actually, this is an annex of an adeptal realm that Master split off to improve Bloom Pruner's gardening functions.
:'''Shuyu:''' The monsters inside are all targets created using adeptal energy, and will act in set ways similar to those of the creatures they're based on. Their combat abilities aren't anywhere close to the originals, though...

:'''Shuyu:''' I guess I'll just... have to accept this name, won't I?

==Open-World Dialogue==
===Grandmaster Hanakado===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' How do things fare, Oni King's Right Hand? Have you led Bloom Pruner to victory upon victory?
:{{DIcon}} That's right, we're invincible!
::'''Paimon:''' Uh... Are we? Are you sure you're not exaggerating a bit too much? To Paimon, saying that sounds like we just breezed through every fight without having to even think about it.
::'''Paimon:''' But when we were using Bloom Pruner, we absolutely had to think carefully about our tactical choices. Not at all like how you can just plow through [[Slime]]s with your eyes shut.
::{{DIcon}} Bloom Pruner's plenty strong for an Onikabuto.
::{{DIcon}} Bloom Pruner's the mightiest among little critters.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, yeah, sure...
::'''Paimon:''' But that comparison really reminds Paimon of the time Grandmaster Hanakado used a real Onikabuto to challenge a Geovishap Hatchling... The hatchling just stomped its feet, and boom, the fight was over.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' And that's exactly what makes mechanical Onikabuto awesome, no?
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Having witnessed Bloom Pruner's performance, I see it now &mdash; the wisdom and foresight the Oni King had in saying that he would expand the boundaries of beetle battling using mechanical Onikabuto!
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Of course, learning mechanics is also stunningly difficult. I've heard that engineering and mathematics classes in Liyue often confound outsiders of similar age... And we're just talking about the basics, here.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' I wonder how good the Oni King is at math...
:{{DIcon}} Leaving that aside, how's Itto doing?
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Ah, right! I forgot to mention this, but the Oni King has been writing letters to me... Well, I say that, but the penmanship indicates that [[Shinobu]] was the one doing the actual writing...
::'''Paimon:''' Tsk, that bull-chucker... he never changes, huh?
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' In any case, I've been kept abreast of important events back in Inazuma. The "[[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness]]" that the Oni King organized, for example...
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' That music festival was even adapted into a light novel, expanding upon the story behind the theme song he sang.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Shinobu also included a limited-edition commemorative copy in one of the letters. The postage fees alone cost a sizable fraction of the Arataki Gang's budget...
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' ...But while the novel itself didn't sell well, and it isn't famous either, I absolutely love the spirit of it!
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Master Shuyu passed the book onto Adeptus Cloud Retainer, and I hear that she rated it as "not lacking in passion, certainly."
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Once I stated the purpose of my visit, she made the connection with the novel, it was only then that, after some discussion with Adeptus Ping, they created "Shuyu's Baffling Beetle Battle Bowl."
::'''Paimon:''' So, part of the inspiration for this beetle battle Domain... comes from that song Bull-Chucker sang!?
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Precisely! And soon, once I've mastered the mystical adeptal arts, I shall return to the Oni King's side, and together, we will organize an "Arataki World-Rocking Beetle Battle Summit"...
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' ...*ahem* Still working on the name, of course. We'll need the Oni King's personal touch to give it that sense of rhyme and rhythm... Anyway, I'll do my best!
:{{DIcon}} How are your lessons with Master Shuyu going?
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' To tell you the truth, it has only been a few days since I discovered the adeptal abode, yet it has been almost a year since the Oni King and I parted. How cruel, truly, is the passage of time!
::'''Paimon:''' What's going on? Is some kinda problem holding you up?
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Not at all. To tell you the truth, I read a text by a true scholar at Wanwen Bookhouse, which states that moving an adeptus is "not a matter to be forced &mdash; rather, felicitous fortuity is the major mechanic"...
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' So I chose not to rely too heavily on [[Xiangling|Chef-sama]]'s guidance. Instead, I chose to work for her for a time as ingredient transport staff &mdash; a way of repaying her and Guoba-san.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Following that, I left Wanmin Restaurant and went to wander the mountain wilds.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' I saw many new and fascinating things in my journey.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' For example... I saw a [[Moon Carver|large red stag]] who could use an [[Supreme Cuisine Machine|automatic cooking pot]]. Why, even from afar, I could see how it tossed ingredients into an empty pot, and out popped a most delicious dish. A sight to behold indeed, truly eye-opening!
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' Liyue's a truly amazing place, huh? Even the local deer know how to use mechanisms!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh. That stag, and the pot... They both sound kinda familiar...
::{{DIcon}} D&mdash;Do they...?
::{{DIcon}} That's... right?
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' It was thanks to that stag that the idea came to me, that I should have a device made by an artisan that could automatically grind and make matcha, and then make some of that tea in places where adeptal sightings and signs are more often seen...
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' And in the end, that was what led Master Shuyu to follow the smell to me, thus granting me the opportunity to visit an adeptal abode.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' I guess this is what they mean by "fortuity as a mechanic" &mdash; or should I say, "mechanical fortuity"? Ah, how sublime, truly sublime...
::{{DIcon}} Is... Is that so?
::{{DIcon}} Is... that how it works?
::'''Paimon:''' Does that really mean what he thinks it does...?
:{{DIcon}} I'll have to sweep the opposition away some other time.
::'''Grandmaster Hanakado:''' No problem! Take care of whatever's on hand, then come back and beetle battle it out to your heart's content once you're free!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Shuyu===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shuyu:''' I didn't know that you two were so good at beetle battles!
:{{DIcon}} That's right, I've always been a master beetle battler.
::'''Paimon:''' Even so, it was usually Bull-Chucker dragging us into it...
::'''Shuyu:''' This really is an interesting form of recreation! If I do get the chance to play it in Inazuma, I'd like to try the original form.
::'''Paimon:''' Sounds good! We've got lots of friends in Inazuma, too, so when you get there, we can get everyone together. We'll have a blast!
:{{DIcon}} We didn't expect you to be a mechanical expert either...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, and you're even teaching others now. You must've learned all kinds of skills by now, huh?
::'''Shuyu:''' I wouldn't say so... Really, I've just been learning the fundamentals from Master...
::'''Shuyu:''' She doesn't live in seclusion anymore these days, nor does she intend to have me live that way.
::'''Shuyu:''' That's why she's taught me two sets of mechanical arts &mdash; one adeptal, and the other mortal.
::'''Shuyu:''' She said that I could make a good living for myself using normal mechanical arts, should I want to live in Liyue Harbor in the future.
::'''Shuyu:''' And that won't get in the way of my continued study of adeptal mechanical arts, either.
::'''Paimon:''' That makes a lot of sense. Wow, she really does think of everything, huh...
::{{DIcon}} Would you like to find a job, Shuyu?
::{{DIcon}} Want to make the big Mora, Shuyu?
::'''Shuyu:''' I... I don't know yet. Right now, I'd prefer to stay by Master's side.
::'''Shuyu:''' But if she needs Mora, I'll help her make some!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think she'd ever need Mora. Even her smallest inventions could sell for crazy amounts in Liyue Harbor...
::{{DIcon}} She's probably even wealthier than [[Zhongli|a certain "consultant"]] we know.
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, he's an exception. There's no point in talking common sense with him.
:{{DIcon}} Let's have a good beetle battle next time!
::'''Shuyu:''' Ah, I guess you've got other things to do, right? In that case, I'll see you around!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Xianyun===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xianyun:''' Ah, it's you. Come, sit, and enjoy some tea &mdash; it's not often that we meet in this manner.
:{{DIcon}} So, I hear you're a "Master of Masters" now?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! The way adepti measure time, it hasn't been that long since you took Shuyu in, right? And now she's got a student of her own.
::'''Xianyun:''' Haha. One would ascribe that more to that child's sense of courtesy. Any who instructs him, he recognizes with the title "Master."
::'''Xianyun:''' One's original intent was to provide Shuyu with a playmate.
::'''Xianyun:''' It has come to one's notice, after all, that Shuyu's peers in Liyue Harbor have friends to accompany them in leisure and share in their interests. Which is a most excellent thing, of course.
::'''Xianyun:''' But [[Mt. Aocang]] is no bustling mortal city with children her age to be found living nearby, and so on occasion one grew concerned that she might be afflicted by loneliness.
::'''Xianyun:''' One was thus pleased to see that young fellow come forth with such deference, and have agreeable conversation with Shuyu.
::'''Xianyun:''' It is somewhat a pity that he is so overly focused, and has never proactively spoken of anything apart from beetle combat or the mechanical arts.
::'''Paimon:''' Good point. Grandmaster Hanakado's never talked about anything but beetle battles with us either. It's almost like he's some sort of... professional competitor?
::'''Xianyun:''' And to hone one's skills without distraction is praiseworthy also. That is why one had Shuyu instruct him in the basics and focus on small devices that can be applied to beetle combat, such as Bloom Pruner.
::'''Xianyun:''' It is said that teaching others is a way to test one's own knowledge. In this way, Shuyu has someone to converse with, and also a means to reinforce her own understanding. Two birds, one stone.
::'''Xianyun:''' And if that makes me a "Master of Masters," then it is not a title ill-given.
:{{DIcon}} So, about studying the mechanical arts...
::'''Xianyun:''' What, has your interest been roused?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, we're just curious. We have used quite a few of your devices in the past, after all. Is learning this stuff hard?
::'''Xianyun:''' The principles behind adeptal mechanisms, their material requirements, and the capabilities that power them... These all have strict requirements. A mortal artisan would just as soon touch the skies as imitate them.
::'''Xianyun:''' Even those as widely-read as yourselves might struggle for a time to comprehend such concepts as "dynamic axes," "force transmission," and "component cycling."
::{{DIcon}} The jargon alone is enough to give me a headache...
::{{DIcon}} Those who don't make things certainly wouldn't be familiar with those ideas...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're scaring Paimon already. Everything about mechanisms sounds super complicated!
::'''Xianyun:''' Do not fret. All have their specialties &mdash; one has never met a person who boasted true mastery in all matters.
::'''Xianyun:''' That said, on the matter of the mechanical arts we were just discussing... That young lad counts as an exception.
::'''Xianyun:''' Of course, he cannot use any adeptal powers. Thus, he must first learn the principles of mortal artisanry and from there build a foundation. And once he has, in latter days, built devices at the zenith of mortal ability, he might then install an adeptal power core into such a machine.
::'''Xianyun:''' He might be able to achieve what he seeks that way, one thinks.
::'''Xianyun:''' To master pure adeptal arts, unless one is a true prodigy, will surely take a hundred years at the very least. Even the mastery of mortal machines, coupled with an adeptal power core, will only result in his ideal device being constructed after three to five decades of dedicated study.
::'''Paimon:''' ...That long? Even studying every single day?
::'''Xianyun:''' Hah! Only those willing to meditate on their studies in silence shall comprehend the truth!
::'''Xianyun:''' Not that one could imagine the two of you sitting still in a classroom, poring over textbooks day in and day out.
::{{DIcon}} I couldn't either &mdash; not right now, anyway...
::{{DIcon}} I still prefer traveling and adventuring!
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. There's still a ton of places out there, waiting for us to explore them... We'll leave the making of complicated machines to people with the talent and patience for that!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's just hope Grandmaster Hanakado's a real genius... We wouldn't want him to be a white-haired old man by the time he finishes learning the mechanical arts...
::'''Paimon:''' Hang on a sec, isn't Itto's hair already white anyway?
:{{DIcon}} Nice! Adeptus-made tea!
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, thanks a lot, Adeptus Cloud Retainer!
::'''Xianyun:''' Heh. No need to be so formal in one's presence.
::{{Black Screen|You and Paimon enjoy the exquisite tea that Xianyun has prepared. You find your spirits lifted and your fatigue dispelled by the drink...}}
