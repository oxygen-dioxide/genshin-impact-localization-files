{{Quest Description|[[Iwata]] of [[Watatsumi Island]] appears to be having some troubles...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Iwata)
:'''Iwata:''' This doesn't seem right either...
:{{DIcon}} Something the matter?
:'''Iwata:''' Ah, hello there, Traveler. Well, I... Um... I'm trying to make some fertilizer.
:'''Iwata:''' I heard from someone that [[Vahid|someone]] from [[Sumeru]] has set up [[Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe|a fertilizer shop]] in [[Ritou]].
:'''Iwata:''' They say that these fertilizers have unusual properties. As long as you add a little when growing plants, they will grow exceedingly lushly.
:'''Iwata:''' But I can't go to Ritou to purchase [[Anahitian Blessing|that fertilizer]], so I tried making my own here...
:{{DIcon}} You figured out how to make some yourself?
:'''Iwata:''' Actually, no... I asked around everywhere before coming up with this method myself.
:'''Iwata:''' To get into the specifics, you want to mix some crops and some, ah, animal excrement together into a pile.
:'''Iwata:''' Afterward, you cover it with a layer of branches and leaves and such to maintain the temperature.
:'''Iwata:''' After a while, they say that the ingredients will undergo some changes and even blend together, forming a sort of fertilizer.
:'''Iwata:''' But no matter how much I experiment, these materials just won't come together. It's really strange...
:{{DIcon}} Do you have the wrong ingredients by any chance?
::'''Iwata:''' Crops, animal excrement, branches and leaves... Should be correct. That's what I've heard, at least.
:{{DIcon}} Did something go wrong during the process?
::'''Iwata:''' Pile the materials up, cover with branches to maintain their temperature. No, this should be correct...
:'''Iwata:''' Where did I go wrong...
:'''Iwata:''' Forget it. Let me just try again. Traveler, could I ask you for a favor?
:'''Iwata:''' I'll make another batch of fertilizer. Once it's done, I'd like you to check on it together with me.
:'''Iwata:''' Given how much you've seen and learned, you might know what went wrong during the process.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:'''Iwata:''' Alright, I'm counting on you, Traveler! I'll make some preparations over there first.
:'''Iwata:''' Making this sort of fertilizer requires some time, so please come find me in a bit. Until then, please help me watch that fertilizer pile.

;(Talk to Iwata again)
:'''Iwata:''' *sigh* I do hope I succeed this time...
----
;(Return the next day and approach Iwata and the slimes)
:'''Iwata:''' H&mdash;Help me! Traveler! Please!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? These monsters seem really angry for some reason...
:'''Paimon:''' And... Eugh, what's that smell?
:'''Paimon:''' N&mdash;No, we've gotta take those monsters out first!

;(Talk to Iwata after defeating the enemies)
:'''Iwata:''' Thank you, Traveler, thank you...
:'''Iwata:''' I was halfway through making the fertilizer when those monsters came charging up out of nowhere...
:'''Iwata:''' That's so strange... But it's good that you showed up when you did.
:{{DIcon}} It might be because of that pile of fertilizer, you know...
:'''Iwata:''' R&mdash;Really? I've heard that this smell is a sign that you might have succeeded.
:'''Iwata:''' Well, in any case, come over here and have a look at the fertilizer. I'll explain as I open it up...
:'''Gorou:''' Hold it!
:'''Iwata:''' Eh? Mr. [[Gorou]]? I wasn't aware that you'd be passing this way today.
:{{DIcon}} On patrol, Gorou?
:'''Gorou:''' I... Uh, never mind that first.
:'''Gorou:''' Is this pile of... stuff your doing?
:'''Iwata:''' Hahaha, yes. This fertilizer was the work of our hands.
:'''Iwata:''' Mr. Gorou, did you come here to check on the fertilizer as well?
:'''Iwata:''' Hehe, in that case, let's...
:'''Gorou:''' Wait! Hold on a moment. I'm not here for that. Wait, actually, I am... But...
:'''Paimon:''' Gorou's face is twisting up something awful...
:{{DIcon}} Let's... adjourn to someplace a little further away...
:'''Gorou:''' Alright, let's do that.

:'''Everyone leaves the fertilizer pile...'''

:'''Iwata:''' So, Mr. Gorou, why are you here?
:'''Gorou:''' Lately, a lot of residents have been complaining of a terrifying stench nearby...
:'''Gorou:''' So for safety, I came to investigate, and wound up following the smell all the way here.
:'''Gorou:''' That's how I found you.
:'''Gorou:''' Iwata, I've heard that you've been researching fertilizer, but the way that you're going about it is...
:{{DIcon}} ...A disturbance to the peace?
:{{DIcon}} ...Far too intense?
:'''Gorou:''' Basically. Either way, Iwata, could you please dispose of that fertilizer? We'll try to help you find some other way.
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' Sir! General Gorou!
:'''Gorou:''' I'm here. What's happened?
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' General, we caught a suspicious person out in the outskirts.
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' She was acting very furtively, calling herself a... fertilizer salesperson, or somesuch.
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' I thought that was awful strange, so I had this person detained. I thought that you might wish to see to her questioning.
:'''Gorou:''' Fertilizer this, fertilizer that... What is it with me and fertilizer today...
:'''Gorou:''' I've got it. I'll be with you shortly. Head back first and help to maintain order.
:'''Gorou:''' Iwata, please deal with the matter of the fertilizer. We'll discuss this further later.
:'''Gorou:''' Traveler, why don't you come with me?
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't seem like there's anything else to do.
:{{DIcon}} A fertilizer... salesperson?
:'''Paimon:''' Someone selling fertilizer? Paimon can't help feel like that's familiar somehow... Nothing's coming to mind, though...
:'''Paimon:''' Ah well, whatever. Let's just go over there and see what's up!

;(Talk to Iwata again)
:'''Iwata:''' *sigh* Fertilizers are much trickier than I thought...
----
;(Approach Alrani and the Sangonomiya Samurai)
:'''Hiroyuki:''' Stay right there and don't move!
:'''Alrani:''' I&mdash;I'm not moving! You asked me to explain, and I explained that I'm really a researcher from the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]]!
:'''Hiroyuki:''' Didn't you say that you're advertising fertilizer?
:'''Alrani:''' I... Can't a researcher from the Akademiya also advertise for fertilizers? Just... Just listen to me for a moment, will you...
:'''Gorou:''' Is this the person?
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' Yes, sir.
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' When we caught her, she was sneaking around the place and wouldn't stop writing certain things down.
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' General, I'm positive that she's a [[Shogunate]] spy!
:'''Alrani:''' I'm not! And I wasn't! I already told you, I'm a researcher! I was just collecting material for my thesis!
:'''Hiroyuki:''' Cut the crap! Do you seriously expect us to believe that you'd walk into a battlefield over a thesis? You're definitely playing at something else!
:'''Alrani:''' ...What could I really dare to play at other than my thesis anyway...
:{{DIcon}} Oh, it's you...
:{{DIcon}} Alrani?
:'''Alrani:''' Traveler! Oh, this is wonderful! Please tell them I'm not a bad person! I'm just here to write my thesis!
:'''Gorou:''' You know her?
:{{DIcon}} Well, you could say that...

:'''You tell Gorou about Alrani...'''

:'''Gorou:''' Does "graduating" really drive researchers from Sumeru this far up the wall...
:'''Gorou:''' But given what you've said, you're only acquaintances at best.
:'''Gorou:''' And as for her status as a "researcher from Sumeru," that's something you only heard from her, isn't it?
:{{DIcon}} That's correct.
:'''Gorou:''' Hmm... I'm afraid that none of the evidence here is conclusive.
:'''Gorou:''' But if she's got your guarantee, I'd wager that she isn't a bad person...
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' General, if I may make a suggestion?
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' Do you remember [[Kaushik]]? That researcher who's been studying our island's culture and history?
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' He's been here all this while, and his credentials are quite solid... Why don't we ask him to tell if this... fertilizer saleswoman is actually a researcher or not?
:'''Gorou:''' That actually sounds like a decent plan. Traveler, could we trouble you to bring Kaushik here?
:'''Gorou:''' Just in case of any incidents, I'll stay here and guard this... fertilizer saleswoman.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:'''Gorou:''' It's up to you then. Come back as quickly as possible.

;(Talk to Alrani, optional)
:'''Alrani:''' I... I'm just here to write a thesis. How in the world did I end up locked up again...

;(Talk to Gorou, optional)
:'''Gorou:''' Bring Kaushik back with you. The sooner the better...

;(Talk to Ookubo Daisuke, optional)
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' I don't get how this person is supposed to look like a researcher.

;(Talk to Hiroyuki, optional)
:'''Hiroyuki:''' What a suspicious character.
----
;(Talk to Kaushik)
:'''Kaushik:''' The meaning of this totem... Hmm? Traveler? Did you have some business with me?
:{{DIcon}} This is about Alrani...
:'''Kaushik:''' Alrani's here? On Watatsumi Island? That's... odd. What's that girl doing here? Shouldn't she be in Liyue?
:{{DIcon}} She was arrested by some soldiers...
:'''Kaushik:''' What? *sigh* Of course. Coming to Watatsumi Island under the present circumstances... Of course they would suspect her.
:'''Kaushik:''' Never mind that for now. Let's head over and help that reckless girl out...
----
;(Talk to Gorou, Alrani, Hiroyuki, or Ookubo Daisuke)
:'''Kaushik:''' Alrani! It really is you! B&mdash;But why are you here in [[Inazuma]]? Weren't you supposed to be in Liyue?
:'''Alrani:''' This... Oh, this is going to be long story, isn't it...
:'''Gorou:''' Mr. Kaushik, you know Alrani?
:'''Kaushik:''' Oh, you... you're General Gorou, aren't you?
:'''Kaushik:''' You surmise correctly. Alrani and I are both researchers from the Akademiya.
:'''Kaushik:''' After that, we left the Akademiya to conduct fieldwork for our own areas of research. I didn't think that I'd meet her here...
:'''Gorou:''' But... Um, can you researchers just freely leave the Akademiya?
:'''Kaushik:''' I wouldn't call it "leaving freely." Alrani and I are both [[Driyosh]].
:'''Kaushik:''' To us, wandering and learning are part of our research process, and as such, we are permitted to leave the Akademiya.
:'''Kaushik:''' General Gorou, I can guarantee that Alrani is telling the truth...
:'''Gorou:''' Alright, then there's no problem.
:'''Alrani:''' Phew... I'm saved... Thank you so much...
:'''Gorou:''' Hiroyuki, Ookubo, this matter is settled. Go attend to your own duties.
:'''Hiroyuki:''' Yes, sir.
:'''Ookubo Daisuke:''' Yes, sir.

:'''Hiroyuki and Ookubo depart...'''

:'''Gorou:''' I'm sorry, Miss Alrani. We mistook you for someone suspicious.
:'''Gorou:''' That said, while we have cleared your name, your barging into Watatsumi Island like this has made no shortage of trouble for us.
:'''Alrani:''' Eh? Are... Are you going to fine me? I&mdash;I don't have very much Mora on me...
:'''Gorou:''' Well, since you did claim to be a fertilizer salesperson earlier, and you're a researcher to boot...
:'''Gorou:''' Well, there is something you can do for us. We have a man named Iwata living here who's researching fertilizer. Miss Alrani, please lend him a hand.
:'''Gorou:''' If you can help him produce some fertilizer that isn't also a public disturbance, then you're free to do search here, just like Mr. Kaushik.
:'''Alrani:''' F&mdash;Fertilizer? Wait, I... I'm just...
:{{DIcon}} She'll be fine!
:{{DIcon}} You've got this, Alrani.
:'''Kaushik:''' Alrani, this is a good opportunity to collect research material. Since you're here in Inazuma, that must mean that your thesis is still...
:'''Alrani:''' Uh... Ugh...
:'''Kaushik:''' You know what the standards for graduation are at the Akademiya. If you can't graduate several years in a row...
:'''Alrani:''' I&mdash;I'll do it! I'll do it, alright?
:'''Alrani:''' I&mdash;I've learned about the fertilizer at Mr. [[Vahid]]'s... I'll get this done in one go, just you all watch!
:{{DIcon}} Graduation begets character growth...
:{{DIcon}} Graduation equals strong motivation...
:'''Gorou:''' Well, then we'll call this a day for now. Miss Alrani, the fertilizer matter is in your hands. I've got some other matters to handle, so if you'll excuse me...
:'''Gorou:''' Ah, yes. Please remind Iwata to, uh, move his fertilizer a bit further away.
:'''Kaushik:''' Alright, I'll continue with my research now. If you have any questions, Alrani, just feel free to ask me.
----
;(Talk to Iwata)
:'''Iwata:''' Traveler, you're back. I've disposed of that pile of fertilizer.
:'''Iwata:''' *sigh* I suppose I'll have to find another place to conduct my experiments...
:'''Iwata:''' Hmm? This person is...
:{{DIcon}} An assistant Gorou found you.
::'''Alrani:''' Hello, I'm Alrani...
:{{DIcon}} A fertilizer specialist from Sumeru.
::'''Alrani:''' Hello there, I'm Alrani... Wait a moment. A fertilizer specialist?
::'''Alrani:''' I... I just learned a little about them.
:'''Alrani:''' Well, either way... The general they called Gorou requested that I assist you with your fertilizer research.
:'''Alrani:''' It's a pleasure to be working with you from now on.
:'''Iwata:''' Is that so... That's great! If we succeed, then we'll be able to plant more crops here on Watatsumi Island!
:{{DIcon}} Do remember to pile the fertilizer further away.
:'''Iwata:''' Eh? Oh! Oh, I get it.
:'''Iwata:''' Yes, the pleasure is all mine, Miss Alrani!
:'''Alrani:''' Yeah, I'll do my best.
:'''Alrani:''' I'll do my best. This is for my thesis...
