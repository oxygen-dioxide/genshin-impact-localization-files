:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 02.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' *sigh* I wonder if I took things a little too far... A few people seemed scared out of their minds.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 03.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' Huh? Hey, you shouldn't be here!
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 04.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' *sigh* Never mind. I assume you overheard me anyway.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 05.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' I work here pretending to be a ghost, but now's my break time, so I took off my costume. I get all hot and stuffy wearing that thing...
:{{DIcon}} So there are no real ghosts here?
:{{DIcon}} It's all planned to scare people. right?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 06.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' Of course, how could there be real ghosts here?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 07.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' No one wants to see a real ghost, neither us nor the participants.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 08.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' They just come here for the atmosphere, or should I say, the chance... Everyone wants the chance to feel the thrill of excitement.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 09.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' When people find themselves in a scary situation, they'll say things that they'd never dare to otherwise. That's what the Test of Courage is all about.
:{{DIcon}} I think I understand.
:{{DIcon}} (Chongyun will be very disappointed.)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903101 zhouliang 10.ogg}} '''Zhouliang:''' *sigh* Okay... I should get back to work now. Hope you and... whoever you're here with have a fun time.
:;(Go to [[Killjoy]])
