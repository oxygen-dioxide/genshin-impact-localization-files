===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;Available before completing To Wish Upon a Star
:'''Waranka:''' He's every bit as bold as his mother... *sigh*...
:'''Mama Coco:''' Quite the clever kid, that one. Besides, he's still just a kid, so it's not like he can go too far. No need to worry about him too much.
:'''Waranka:''' Just thinking about what could happen to him, I...
:'''Mama Coco:''' It's fine! No need to scare yourself. Always look on the bright side!
:'''Mama Coco:''' I'll help you look for him in a bit. I'm sure he's fine, maybe he's just hanging out with someone else's kids and lost track of time.
:'''Waranka:''' Thank you...

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;Available after completing To Wish Upon a Star
:'''Waranka:''' ...Strange footfalls. Are you guests from afar?
:{{DIcon}} About [[Orqo]]...
::'''Waranka:''' So, you know the kid... Are you the travelers from abroad he mentioned? I hope he didn't cause you too much trouble, and that you won't hold it against him.
::'''Waranka:''' Without his mother around to keep him in check, he's quite a bit more mischievous than most kids. As for me... I have my difficulties, which limit what I can do for him.
::{{DIcon}} He seems to really want to help you.
::'''Waranka:''' Yes, yes, so I've heard. Perhaps I'm the one in the wrong... When I think of how his mother is gone, I tell him stories to drive his loneliness away...
::'''Waranka:''' But I never expected him to believe them, and try to use magic to bring his mother back... *sigh* Should I wake him up from his fantasies? I just don't know what to do...
:{{DIcon}} You've got good hearing...
::'''Waranka:''' Thanks for the compliment, but that's a skill I've honed due to my other deficiencies... Maybe it would be better if I hadn't.
::'''Waranka:''' If you're an adventurer, be very careful of the "Gem Collector," lest you end up like me.
::{{DIcon}} About the "Gem Collector"...
::'''Waranka:''' He's a fiendish, vicious villain. The "gems" he loves are not those beloved of the [[Children of Echoes]]' artisans... Anyway, keep your guard up around him.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your time.
::'''Waranka:''' I wish you all the best.
