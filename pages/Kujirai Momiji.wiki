{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kujirai Momiji:''' Hello there! Are you here to join the Kujirai Guild?
;(After completing [[Exploding Population]])
:{{DIcon|Fishing Supplies}} I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' Of course! We need excellent tools to do the work that we must, after all. You do indeed have the qualities of a child of the sea. Alright then, take your pick.
:;(Opens the [[Inazuma Fishing Association]] shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you, anyway?
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' Oh, right. I thought you were here to join the Guild. So you don't recognize me, huh.
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' Allow me to introduce myself, then. I am the successor to the Kujirai Fishing Method and the founder of the Kujirai Guild &mdash; Kujirai Momiji, daughter of the ocean!
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' *sigh* Come on, don't look at me like that.
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' As a fisherwoman, I was born near the ocean, grew up near the ocean... and someday, I will return to it as well.
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' So there should be no problem in me calling myself the "daughter of the ocean" and stuff, right?
:{{DIcon}} What's the Kujirai Guild, anyway?
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' It's an association for the children of the sea...
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' *cough* Sorry, was that too hard to understand? Let me try that again.
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' The Kujirai Guild was created by yours truly, and it's a fishing association revolving around the Kujirai Fishing Method.
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' It's not the biggest organization around, but each of our members is a certified ace angler!
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' And it is my belief that with our hereditary art, the Kujirai Fishing Method, our guild will one day spread all over the land!
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' How about it, then? If you join now, you'll get to be a founder, y'know?
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Kujirai Momiji:''' Bye! You're welcome back anytime if you want to join the Kujirai Guild.
