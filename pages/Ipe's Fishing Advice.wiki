{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk at first location)
:'''Ipe:''' You're pretty good at fishing! Reckon there's room for improvement, though!",
:{{DIcon}} Eh!?
:{{DIcon}} What happened to greeting before deciding to just show up?
:'''Ipe:''' Ahaha, sorry, sorry... I always forget to say hi and all. Easy to forget that I might scare people, you know?
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't seem to stop you from enjoying it...
:'''Ipe:''' Aw, come on~ Scaring kids is fun from time to time, don'cha think
:'''Ipe:''' *cough* Anyway, let's get back to talking about fishing.
:{{DIcon}} What, is it serious business?
:{{DIcon}} You really love fishing, don't you...
:'''Ipe:''' Well, so, I know this isn't the best look... But when I was fishing earlier, I dropped the charm that [[Makiri]] gave me. It's got blessings from her ancestral spirits and the Great Thunderbird in it.
:'''Ipe:''' I... I don't know what I'd tell her if she found out that I lost it after we board the boat...
:'''Ipe:''' The golden boat-guy said that he'd scrounge some people up to help me search, but it doesn't look like anyone's coming! So I thought that since you're here, you can help me out too!
:{{DIcon}} And here I thought you were the reliable one...
:{{DIcon}} You're hopeless...
::'''Ipe:''' There is an isle west of the Autake Plains that faces three waterfalls. It should be in the sea further west of that small island...
:'''Ipe:''' My usual fishing spot's just over there, but... my memory's getting weaker and weaker somehow, so I'm afraid that I've gotta leave it to you to help me search...
:{{DIcon}} Since it's a place of ancient memory...
:{{DIcon}} I guess the "feather" should do the trick...
:'''Ipe:''' Eh? What do you mean? Is this some way in which you outsiders find things?
:'''Ipe:''' *sigh* Well, whatever it might be, you should be able to find the charm as long as you find the right spot.
:{{DIcon}} And how will I search for the charm itself?
:'''Ipe:''' Uhh... By fishing it out of the water?"
:{{DIcon}} ..I guess that works.
:'''Ipe:''' Thank you, friend from afar! May the Great Thunderbird and our ancestors protect you!

;(Talk to Ipe before obtaining the charm)
:'''Ipe:''' You're back! Did you find the charm?
:{{DIcon}} I need a bit more time.
:'''Ipe:''' Ah, I see, I see. No rush, y'know? Stay safe while you're at it too, friend from afar.
:'''Ipe:''' You'll find an isle west of the Autake Plains that faces three waterfalls. The charm I'm searching for is in the waters west of that small island...

;(Talk to Ipe after obtaining the charm)
:'''Ipe:''' Hey! You're back!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Is this what you were looking for?
::(Open item inventory)
:'''Ipe:''' Thank you so much! Now I can finally board the boat in peace...
:{{DIcon}} Where is that boat going, anyway?
:'''Ipe:''' To the land of gold, the land of dreams. A realm with no fog. We'll meet again in dreams, friend.
