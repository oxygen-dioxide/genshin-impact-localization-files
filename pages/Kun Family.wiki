The '''Kun family''' is a famous lineage of artisans and weaponsmiths. Its most notable member is [[Kunwu]].

==History==
It is unknown how long the Kun family has been around, but their history as craftsmen began with Kunwu, who was training to be a scholar when he came into possession of the [[Archaic Petra|Sundial of Enduring Jade]]. Entranced by its flawless design, Kunwu decided to change tracks and become a craftsman in hopes of challenging the sundial's creator, [[Morax]]. He would go on to create [[Solar Pearl]], [[Dragon's Bane]], and [[Lion's Roar]], among his known weapons.

In the present, [[Kun Jun]] is said to come from a line of famous artisans and his surname is the same as Kunwu's, making him a likely member of the Kun family.
