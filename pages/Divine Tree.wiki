The '''Divine Tree''' is the tree upon which [[Sumeru City]] is built. It holds up the [[Sumeru Akademiya]].

==Overview==
{{Quote|The years this Divine Tree has seen exceed the total amount of rice grains contained in all the pilaf in Port Ormos.|[[Yasmin]]|[[The Great Tree]]}}
The Divine Tree has been around for ages and is of great importance to Sumeru City. Students from [[Amurta]] such as [[Yasmin]] monitor and record the condition of the Divine Tree's roots as a preventative measure.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Great Tree}}</ref>

Some parts of the city are physically higher up than others, and this hierarchy translates into the social structure as well: the lower level is for the "common folk," and getting a promotion or seeking higher education allows one to "move up."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kamal}}</ref> If somebody says "down below" in Sumeru City, it is understood that they are referring to the bottom of the tree.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About the Divine Tree}}</ref> The bottom of the tree is where the [[Grand Bazaar]] and other common buildings are, the middle is home to the [[Akademiya]], and at the very top is the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]], which served as the residence of the current Dendro Archon, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=840 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 14m)</ref>
