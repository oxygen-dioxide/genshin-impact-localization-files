'''''The Way Into the Mountain''''' is a [[World Quest]] in [["Collective of Plenty"]], [[Natlan]].

==Steps==
* Start the quest by talking to [[Dutse]] or [[Duniya]] in "Collective of Plenty"
# Find a way into the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|Sacred Mountain]]
#* Proceed to the [[Remnants of Tetenanco|excavation site]] to look for clues (optional)
#* Proceed to the [[Tephric Ruins]] to look for clues (optional)

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing either ''[[A Brief History of Rocks]]'' or ''[[Investigator of Ancient Ruins]]'' is sufficient to complete this quest.
** These sub-quests can be completed prior to starting this quest. In that case, this quest auto-completes after talking to Dutse and Duniya.
* The next quest, ''[[Nahuatzin's Leap]]'', can be done without starting ''The Way Into the Mountain''. Upon completion of ''Nahuatzin's Leap'', ''The Way Into the Mountain'' can no longer be started.{{Verify|What if The Way Into the Mountain was already started?}}
* It is possible to start ''Nahuatzin's Leap'' before ''The Way Into the Mountain'' is accepted, however, ''The Way Into the Mountain'' can still be accepted so long as ''Nahuatzin's Leap'' isn't completed.

:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roar...
:{{DIcon}} D&mdash;Did the volcano just... erupt?
:'''Paimon:''' No... It's been super duper quiet... D&mdash;Did you see it erupt?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}? {{Little One}}? What's up? What's with those faces?
:'''Paimon:''' You look like a pair of detectives from a light novel who've suddenly realized the truth about the killer...
:{{DIcon}} We saw some sort of "truth," alright...
::{{DIcon}} (You explain what you saw to Paimon...)
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? You saw the same stuff you did when we first arrived in [[Natlan]] and met {{Little One}}?"
:{{DIcon}} The true identity of the cake murderer is... Paimon!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Darn it! How did you know? Paimon was certain no one saw her eating Little Miss Cake... Just kidding, Paimon actually stole the [[Blazed Meat Stew]]!
::'''Paimon:''' So, you... Wait, what did you just see?
::{{DIcon}} (You explain what you saw to Paimon...)
::'''Paimon:''' So, you saw some weird words again...
:'''Paimon:''' And some strange images?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehrr?
:'''Paimon:''' You said you saw some strange words before... Umm, Paimon didn't see anything, so she can't be sure, but... might they have been written by the same person?
:{{DIcon}} I think that's the case, yes...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, something feels fishy to Paimon... But, this time you also saw... a giant section of ruins, a broken city, and the [[Abyss]]...
:'''Paimon:''' And some "Sacred Mountain"... Hmm, don't the Natlanese call that volcano the "Sacred Mountain"? Could it be that what you saw has something to do with the volcano?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't shake the feeling that the person who united us with {{Little One}} really wants us to go there...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm. Do you think we can help the little one remove his... what was it called... [[Flamelord's Blessing]]? Y'know, if we get to that mountain?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, let's go there then. Gotta help you grow big and strong, after all!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh right! One of the six tribes of Natlan, the [[Collective of Plenty]], lives beside the volcano. Maybe we can ask them for help!

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Dutse or Duniya)
:'''???:''' The Sacred Mountain seems to be having some tummy troubles. It pukes stuff out every day. You've seen it too. It's too dangerous to go out and play!
:'''???:''' In Uncle [[Kimosi]]'s stories, whenever the volcano's having tummy troubles, all it needs is a few good pats and it starts to feel better... If only my hands were bigger...
:'''???:''' I'm sure the grown-ups could pat it better, but they don't want us playing outside the tribe, so they keep puttin' it off.
:'''???:''' Haha, so that's what you think, huh? If you ask me, the Sacred Mountain's so big, we'd need the whole tribe to pat the tummy ache away.
:'''???:''' But the grown-ups are all so busy! Just look at [[Varesa]] working in [[Varesa's Orchard|the orchard]] all day long. We'll have to wait until they all have free time and then pat the volcano together...
:'''Dutse:''' Hmm, you make a good point... *sigh* So we'll just have to wait until the grown-ups get some free time, huh...
:'''???:''' And until then, we follow their rules and don't go outside the tribe until the Sacred Mountain has calmed down, okay?
:'''Dutse:''' ...Okay.
:'''Paimon:''' What are you two discussing? Paimon just heard a lot of talk about "patting tummies"...
:'''Dutse:''' We were talking about... ah... {{MC|m=Blond|f=Blonde}} hair and a silver fairy... You must be the heroes {{Traveler}} and Paimon!
:'''Dutse:''' So anyway, we were discussing some very, super, ultra-important tribal secrets!
:{{DIcon}} So, patting volcanoes is a "tribal secret"...
:'''Dutse:''' Wh&mdash;What!? Did you hear everything?
:'''???:''' You were talking too loudly! The next time you want to discuss secrets, whisper into my ear, okay?
:'''Dutse:''' Okay... *sigh* But won't that be a little too, uh... close in?
:'''Duniya:''' Haha, if you say so. Well then, outlander guest, I'm Duniya, and this hapless idiot is Dutse...
:'''Dutse:''' Will you stop calling me an idiot?
:'''Duniya:''' Welcome to the Collective of Plenty! And welcome to your little [[Tepetlisaurus]]... That's odd, there should be runes that stop outside [[saurian]]s from entering the tribe... Does this have something to do with the Sacred Mountain being in a bad way?
:'''Dutse:''' Hmph, this just shows that the runes need a good pat too!
:'''Duniya:''' The only thing around here that needs a good hard pat is your head! Still, I never expected great heroes like yourself to turn up in the Collective of Plenty...
:'''Duniya:''' Do you need help with something?
:{{Black Screen|You explain to Duniya and Dutse that you wish to enter the Sacred Mountain...}}
:'''Duniya:''' You want to enter the Sacred Mountain!? That's not going to be easy... The grown-ups keep telling us it's a dangerous place, so we're not allowed to go in there...
:'''Duniya:''' But I'm sure you have your reasons for wanting to go..
:'''Duniya:''' Hmm... I know there was once someone else who found a way in...
:'''Dutse:''' M&mdash;Me too! I know someone too!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, isn't the Sacred Mountain, well, sacred to your tribe? How come you're so happy to tell us all about it?
:'''Duniya:''' The name "Sacred Mountain" comes from woven scrolls from a long, long time ago... As far as we're concerned, it's nowhere near as sacred as the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]].
:'''Duniya:''' The only reason we're not allowed to go inside is because it's dangerous.
:'''Dutse:''' Not to mention, the [[Speaker's Chamber]] has organized exploration teams to go inside and poke around... Hehe, as soon as I'm old enough, I'm going to go there too!
:'''Duniya:''' How many times do you need to be told? That place is dangerous!
:'''Duniya:''' Hmm... I'm unsure of the details, but if you want, you could try talking to {{Color|buzzword|Old Man Mposo}}. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to help.
:'''Dutse:''' "Idle Old Man [[Mposo]]"? You'd be better off asking {{Color|buzzword|Kimosi}}. Hehe, Kimosi's my uncle, and he used to be an adventurer...
:'''Duniya:''' Don't call Old Man Mposo idle! Uhh... Unfortunately, one of them's at {{Color|buzzword|the excavation site south of the mountain}} and the other's at {{Color|buzzword|the Tephric Ruins west of the village}}...
:'''Duniya:''' If only we could show you the way, but with the Sacred Mountain in its eruption cycle, it's not safe for us to take you...
:'''Paimon:''' No problem! Paimon thinks we can find our own way from here!
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, {{Little One}}! It's time to go!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Duniya:''' Hehe, he's a little cutie, isn't he? That scarf tied to his tail is so pretty. When the Sacred Mountain's feeling better, let us take him out to play!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay! But Paimon wants to come too!

:'''Paimon:''' The excavation site and the Tephric Ruins... Which one should we head to first...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, you sure look like you know where you wanna go first!

;(Talk to Duniya or Dutse again, optional)
:'''Duniya:''' Oh, outlander hero, did something happen?
:'''Dutse:''' Couldn't find the excavation site and the Tephric Ruins? I guess we'll have to... "bend" the grown-ups' little rule then...
:'''Duniya:''' ...
:'''Dutse:''' *sigh* Oh, alright... I won't go outside the tribe...
;(Subsequent open-world dialogue starts from here)
:'''Duniya:''' So, {{Traveler}}... What would you like to know?
:{{DIcon}} About the excavation site...
::'''Duniya:''' Oh, it should really be called the Remnants of the Secret Source excavation site. It's a large area of ruins to the south of the Sacred Mountain.
::'''Duniya:''' It's said that they were abandoned by dragons, long, long ago. Old Man Mposo patrols the area daily to keep marauding [[Treasure Hoarders]] away...
::'''Duniya:''' He used to be interested in ruins and relics. He even joined the [[Saurian Relics Association (Faction)|Saurian Relics Association]] back in the day. He likes to tell us all stories of the past.
::'''Dutse:''' But he's no good at storytelling &mdash; he's just so boooring. It's all dusty old details, like seeing "referential" totems in patterns on the stone...
::'''Duniya:''' I think you mean "reverential" totems... Old Man Mposo's more of an archaeologist than a storyteller...
::'''Duniya:''' Apparently, he once explored the volcano itself. He might just be able to help you out.
:;(Returns to dialogue option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the Tephric Ruins...
::'''Dutse:''' Aha! So, you want to know about the Tephric Ruins? Now, that's something I do know about!
::'''Dutse:''' Long, long ago... back when Natlan was still a peaceful paradise...
::'''Duniya:''' Ah, actually, it was [[cataclysm|500 years ago]], just as the [[Abyss]]al corrosion in Natlan was at its worst &mdash; an entire section of ruins was spat out by the volcano.
::'''Dutse:''' Oh, come on, Duniya, why do you always have to interrupt my story!?
::'''Duniya:''' Because every time you tell this one, you always start with this "Long, long ago" stuff... No one wants to hear it!
::'''Dutse:''' ...I mean, that's how Uncle Kimosi told me the story, and he was a member of the exploration team assembled by the Speaker's Chamber!
::'''Dutse:''' I've heard there've been traces of the Abyss discovered around the Tephric Ruins again recently. I wonder how Uncle Kimosi's doing...
::'''Dutse:''' If you do go there, can you check on how he's doing for me?
:;(Returns to dialogue option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions.
::'''Duniya:''' Then I wish you a successful journey!
::'''Dutse:''' Hehe, drop by again!
