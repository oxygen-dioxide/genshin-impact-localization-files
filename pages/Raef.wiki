{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Raef:''' Not here yet, huh...
:{{DIcon}} What are you waiting for?
::'''Raef:''' To tell you the truth, I'm not sure either.
::'''Raef:''' It might be those who left the village to buy some daily essentials, and it might also be the goods that our Eremite friends are sending over.
::'''Raef:''' Who knows? We might even receive guests from Shamaniyya.
::'''Raef:''' Alright, alright. In truth, my role is that of a lookout. I warn people of hazards that arise from the desert.
::'''Raef:''' That said, though, the desert around Aaru Village is a place of relative quiet, so what I usually end up reporting is the arrival of goods from outside the village.
::'''Raef:''' But thanks to that, I also get to hang out and chat with those who often travel outside, you know, maybe ask them to get me some seeds or a pot of flowers.
::{{DIcon}} Fond of planting flowers?
:::'''Raef:''' Well, uh, I... I just like having some to send to my [[Nermin|girlfriend]], you get what I mean?
:::'''Raef:''' She's never been the healthy sort, so she's always at home resting and can't come out often... But she always looks way better when she has some plants for company.
:::'''Raef:''' I mean, Aaru Village is as you see it... It's no haven for plants that need water.
:::'''Raef:''' Many times, those flowers that do get sent over don't live long even when given a lot of loving care.
:::'''Raef:''' That's why I ask my fellow workers to get some of that stuff whenever I get the chance.<!--
::{{DIcon}} Fond of planting flowers?
:::'''Raef:''' Well, uh, I... I just like having some to send to my girlfriend, you get what I mean?
:::'''Raef:''' She wasn't well previously and is still resting at home even now, so she rarely goes out. But she really does love flowers &mdash; she looks much better whenever she is around them.

::{{DIcon}} Sha-what-yya?
:::'''Raef:''' Oh? Are you interested?
:::'''Raef:''' According to legend, they are a group of people who dwell in the depths of the desert.
:::'''Raef:''' Some say that they were not on good terms with the Akademiya, and thus fled deep into the desert to avoid them.
:::'''Raef:''' Others say that they are an investigation team sent into the desert by the Akademiya.
:::'''Raef:''' As for the details, I'm not very sure, but it's all hearsay. No one has ever seen them.
:::'''Raef:''' But between you and me, I do hope that this legend is in fact real. It would be nice to see them and hear their tales from far away someday, you know?
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Raef:''' See you. Be wary of any changes in the environment when you are out in the desert!
