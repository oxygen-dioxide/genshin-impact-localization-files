{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Harrison:''' Shush! Are you here to "stock up"?
:'''Harrison:''' Keep your voice down, and I can show you some real goodies...
:{{DIcon}} Goodies...?
::'''Harrison:''' Exactly! The goods at International Groceries are premium products imported from merchants all over the world. We've got them in all types and categories, I'm sure you'll like one of them.
::{{DIcon}} You sure you're not smug...
::'''Harrison:''' Shh! The walls have ears, my friend!
::'''Harrison:''' These are imported goods! I've never heard of this smuggling nonsense, haha!
::'''Harrison:''' I see you're an outlander as well. You understand what we're about, right?
::'''Harrison:''' If you need anything, remember to help a brother out.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} This...
:::'''Harrison:''' *sigh*... Sincerity is a key part of doing business, is it not? Just treat it as a gift from a friend.
:::'''Harrison:''' Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? I'll be seeing you around!
