{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Granna:''' Ah, Sedile's back in the village on vacation! I'll have to ask her how to pass the exam and join the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]!
:{{DIcon}} Huh, so there's an exam for that too...
::'''Granna:''' Of course there is! Or do you think they let just anyone in?
::'''Granna:''' It's precisely because they're so strict that passing is considered impressive. Hmph, I've gotta grab this chance to ask Sedile everything!
::'''Granna:''' And once I've made it, I'm so gonna show off to [[Virda]]!
:{{DIcon}} May you be successful.
::'''Granna:''' Heh, thanks, but no need! I'll be fine, with or without anyone's well-wishes!
