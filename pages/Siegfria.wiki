==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Siegfria:''' Need to make a delivery? I deliver to the city.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Siegfria:''' My name's Siegfria. I work odd jobs doing deliveries back and forth between Mondstadt and Springvale.
::'''Siegfria:''' When there's no jobs going, I pick wild vegetables and trade them for a bit of meat with the hunting guys.
::'''Siegfria:''' I figure that even hunters can't eat meat every single day of their lives, so everyone's happy.
:{{DIcon}} You seem to have a keen interest in food.
::'''Siegfria:''' Keen interest? Hmm... I wouldn't go that far... I just need to eat to live!
::'''Siegfria:''' I spend every last Mora I make on food; adding in some wild vegetables and the occasional show of support from a kind hunter, I still end each day feeling like there hasn't quite been enough to eat.
::'''Siegfria:''' And then as soon as I start working, I get even more hungry...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Siegfria:''' Look after yourself.
