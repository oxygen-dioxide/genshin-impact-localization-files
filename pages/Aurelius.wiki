{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aurelius:''' Oh, hello. Can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} You're a... Mondstadter?
::'''Aurelius:''' Yes. I'm Aurelius, born and raised in Mondstadt. A few years back, I came here on my journey of tracing the footsteps of a lady poet.
::'''Aurelius:''' I didn't want to come in the beginning, but once I got here, I realized that this place is awesome. No one will force me to be a poet here.
::'''Aurelius:''' To be honest, even though my parents are both poets, I detest poetry...
::'''Aurelius:''' Instead of heading back home and letting them use beautiful rhymes to mock my lousy poems, I feel much more free and at ease here.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing...
::'''Aurelius:''' Hope you have a good day, my friend.
