* Strikes nearby opponents with lightning, dealing {{Color|Electro DMG}} to opponents she comes in contact with. Each opponent can only be struck once.
* Once this ability's effects end, Oz will remain on the battlefield and attack his Prinzessin's foes. If Oz is already on the field, then this will reset the duration of his presence.

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{TalentNote|energy frame|11}}<ref name="Genshin Academy burst info sheet">GenshinAcademy: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iLUT8Tafwih3RZbNlA59w6-x5NQdgPvsMc86b7W92DQ/edit#gid=0 Elemental Burst Frame Tests]</ref>
* {{TalentNote|cooldown frame|2}}<ref name="Genshin Academy burst info sheet" />
* Upon casting this skill, Fischl takes on Oz's form for a short duration. She has [[Invincibility Frames]] only during the very brief casting period. While Fischl is in Oz's form, Fischl can still take damage as normal, unlike the invulnerability usually granted when casting an Elemental Burst.
* While in Oz's form, Fischl's [[Interruption Resistance]] is greatly increased.
* {{TalentNote|icd|Falling Thunder DMG|5|4}}
** This ICD is shared with the extra Electro DMG at [[Her Pilgrimage of Bleak|Constellation 4]].
* This skill summons Oz or refreshes his duration. For more information on Oz, see [[Nightrider]].
** With proper rotation between this skill and Fischl's Elemental Skill, Oz can be on the field for 20s (or 24s with Fischl's C6) every 25s.
** The Oz summoned by Midnight Phantasmagoria does not affect Nightrider's cooldown.
** The Oz summoned by Midnight Phantasmagoria is identical to the Oz summoned by Nightrider.
* This talent can be ended early by switching to another character. Oz will be summoned upon switching characters.

==Trivia==
* {{TalentNote|clap}}
* While in Oz's form, Fischl can travel over water at the same speed as on land. This is not very useful given the short duration of the ability, though, and also cannot be used to bypass any elemental reactions since Fischl will still become Wet.
