==Puzzles==
===Light Board===
There is a [[Luxurious Chest]] behind a bubble. Completing various [[Preprint]] puzzles around the area will remove the bubble and unlock the chest. ''Fairground Gathering, Summer Lights Illuminated'' is required to complete this to unlock one of the three Hydro Eidolons that will remove the bubble. The puzzles can be completed in any order.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After lighting the first lamp)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, that light board is really interesting! The white light transformed into all sorts of different colors!
:'''Paimon:''' There are still two more white lamps, so let's look elsewhere. Maybe we'll find the Water Droplets that can fix 'em, too!

;(After lighting the second lamp)
:'''Paimon:''' That's another lamp fixed! Thanks a bunch, Water Droplet!

;(After lighting the third lamp by completing a puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this is the last lamp. Let's go back to the big tent and check things out!

;(Approach the unlit lamp after completing ''Fairground Gathering, Summer Lights Illuminated'')
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Isn't this the Water Droplet we saved a while back?

;(Approach the three lit lamps at the tent)
:'''Paimon:''' The multi-colored lights are really pretty! This sure is an ingenious design, huh?
