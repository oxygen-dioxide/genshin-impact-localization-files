==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing this Hidden Exploration Objective will award the {{Achievement|The Lengthy Reunion}}.
* The following enemies may engage the player in combat along the Sumpter Beast's path:
*# [[The Eremites/Enemies|Eremites]]
*# [[Treasure Hoarders]]
*# [[Fungi]] (in a [[Withering Zone]])
* The Sumpter Beast may become [[Aggravation|aggravated]] in the Withering Zone, but the objective can still be completed after it de-aggravates.
* If the Sumpter Beast is killed, the player will have to wait 12 hours for it to respawn in order to attempt the objective again.
* If the objective fails for some reason (owner does not spawn, etc.), it can be restarted by returning to the starting point.
* The owner spawns and begins to wander around the area without a fixed route before the Sumpter Beast stops at its destination. The owner may descend the hill.
* If the trek is uninterrupted, it takes 7–8 minutes to complete.
