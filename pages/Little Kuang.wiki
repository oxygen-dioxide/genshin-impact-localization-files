{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Little Kuang:''' Huh, that's so fascinating! Chenyu Vale is so unlike [[Liyue Harbor]]!
:{{DIcon}} Run into anything fun?
::'''Little Kuang:''' In a lot of ways!
::'''Little Kuang:''' For example, there are absolutely huge goats in the village to the south, ten times larger than the goats in any book!
::'''Little Kuang:''' While floating over on a bamboo raft, I saw a jade ornament the size of a mountain... A jade ring? A jade pendant? What was it again...
::'''Little Kuang:''' Whatever! Forget it! I'll figure it out one day.
::'''Little Kuang:''' A girl fishing by the waterfall said there's a type of Carp in Chenyu Vale that bestows good luck upon those who see it! I wanna find one!
::'''Little Kuang:''' The most interesting is the Wushou Dance that [[Dip Yeuk]] and his friends are doing! They're like big cats with painted faces nimbly jumping up and down!
::'''Little Kuang:''' Anyway... Everything here is so novel! So many things here I've never seen or heard of before!
:{{DIcon}} Play safe, y'hear?
::'''Little Kuang:''' It's fine! Chenyu Vale is huge, so there are so many places where I can play!
::'''Little Kuang:''' My parents wouldn't let me leave the city when we lived in Liyue Harbor, so I was limited to playing by the entrance or at the docks...
::'''Little Kuang:''' But there were too many people in both those places. I kept running into people all the time. Sometimes, there would be groups of people moving things at the docks, and that put me at risk of being struck by something.
::'''Little Kuang:''' Yeelong Barf is much better. It may be small, but it has just the right amount of people, so I can play to my heart's content!
:{{DIcon}} Bye, go have some fun!
::'''Little Kuang:''' Hehe, I'm going to meet Dip Yeuk later so he can tell me his amazing stories about [[Gaming]]!
