*Floor 11 Ley Line Disorders changed to:
** When opponents are defeated, all party members will be affected by the "Corrosion" status.
** Characters being Corroded will lose a fraction of their HP every second. Active characters can be brought down by Corrosion. When a non-active character's HP is less than 15%, they will no longer lose HP due to Corrosion.
** Corrosion lasts 10s and can stack. The duration of each stack is counted independently.
* Floor 12 Ley Line Disorders changed to:
** For this floor only, the ley line flow will be normal.
* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
*Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.1, the two Lunar Phases will be as follows：
**Phase I:
***Renewing Moon<br />After a character uses an Elemental Burst, all party members' ATK is increased by 6.5% for 15s. Maximum 7 stacks. When 7 stacks are reached, the active character's Normal Attacks will unleash a shockwave at the position of the opponent it hits, dealing AoE DMG. A shockwave can be unleashed in this manner once every 2s.
**Phase II:
***Cavorting Moon<br />For 10s after a character uses an Elemental Burst, that character's Normal and Charged Attacks will unleash a shockwave at the position of the opponent they hit at the cost of 1% of the character's HP, dealing AoE DMG. This effect will be cleared when this character leaves the field. A shockwave can be unleashed in this manner once every 1s. Active characters can go down as a result of this HP loss.
* There will be no change to the reset times of the Spiral Abyss and Blessing of the Abyssal Moon. These remain the first and sixteenth days of each month, respectively. The above Spiral Abyss update will take effect from September 16 (Server Time).
