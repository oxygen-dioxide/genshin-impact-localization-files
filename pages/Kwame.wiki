:'''Purum:''' I'm aware that the question I'm about to ask you will drag this out even longer.
:'''Kwame:''' Okay, uhh... go ahead?
:'''Purum:''' Do you have any idea how long it's been since we sat down to eat? Any at all?
:'''Kwame:''' Hmm, I haven't really been paying attention. About the amount of time it takes to eat a Tataco?
:'''Purum:''' The amount of time it takes you to eat a Tataco, more like! I've just about digested my whole darn meal here!
:'''Kwame:''' Wow, impressive. But what's the rush? Besides, after you've just finished eating, it's always a good idea to take a rest before you set off &mdash; helps keep the stomachache at bay.
:'''Purum:''' You're not seriously suggesting I should be thanking you, are you?
:'''Kwame:''' Actually, yes, I suppose I am.
