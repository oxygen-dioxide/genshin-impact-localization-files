==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Toda:''' Alas, O nation of Eternity...
:'''Toda:''' ...Ah, hello. What can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Toda:''' My name is Toda. I am the liaison between the [[Yashiro Commission]] and the Grand Narukami Shrine.
::'''Toda:''' My daily work is to handle all the issues in the shrine, such as fund raising, allocating manpower, and such...
::'''Toda:''' All trivial matters, I know. Still, it is my solemn honor to be working for the [[Kamisato Clan]].
::{{DIcon}} Tell me a little more about the Kamisato Clan.
:::'''Toda:''' Within the Kamisato Clan, the Commissioner [[Kamisato Ayato]] is in charge of all the Yashiro Commission's affairs. Miss Ayaka is in charge of everything in the mansion.
:::'''Toda:''' Inazuma's [[Tri-Commission]] have some really complicated relationships with each other. Although the Yashiro Commission is the least controversial among them, it is still very busy.
:::'''Toda:''' As such, Sir Kamisato doesn't really stay in the mansion too often. If you need something from the Kamisato Clan, it's better that you visit [[Kamisato Ayaka|Miss Kamisato]] or Mr. [[Thoma]].
:{{DIcon}} You look very worried...
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Toda:''' Ah, you noticed... I've heard from the shrine maidens that more and more people wish to abolish the Sakoku Decree.
:::'''Toda:''' If the Sakoku Decree cannot bring happiness to Inazuma, what kind of impact will it have on the other nations in Teyvat...
:::'''Toda:''' ...I don't really have a conclusion for now. But as a member of the Yashiro Commission, all I can do is trust in [[Ei|the Almighty Shogun]].
:::'''Toda:''' If it is in the Shogun's decision, then it must be beneficial to Eternity...
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Toda:''' Well, I wouldn't call it "worry" exactly. With the Sakoku Decree's abolition, I'm sure that Inazuma will undergo some changes.
:::'''Toda:''' I can't be sure what effects this reopening will have on the other nations of Teyvat...
:::'''Toda:''' ...But though I can't say anything conclusively at the moment, as a member of the Yashiro Commission, all I can do is trust in the Almighty Shogun.
:::'''Toda:''' If it is the Shogun's decision, then it must be meant to achieve Eternity somehow...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Toda:''' Aye... see you!
