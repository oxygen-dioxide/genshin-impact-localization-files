* During this attack, the Consecrated Red Vulture will temporarily exit '''Phagocytic Form''' and spawn a Phagocytic Energy Block that lasts for '''6''' seconds.
** The Phagocytic Energy Block can be destroyed using a single {{Pyro}} attack or 6 non-Pyro elemental attacks.
** If destroyed, the active character will obtain a status that lasts for 10 seconds:
*** While the status is active, all party members will lose '''2%''' of their Max [[HP]] every second.
*** The next time a [[Normal Attack|Normal]]/[[Charged Attack|Charged]]/[[Plunging Attack|Plunging]] Attack, [[Elemental Skill]] or [[Elemental Burst]] hits the Consecrated Red Vulture, the status is consumed and it will lose '''15%''' of its Max HP and become paralyzed.
*** If the status expires after 10 seconds, the Consecrated Red Vulture will re-enter '''Phagocytic Form'''.
** If not destroyed in time, the Consecrated Red Vulture will reabsorb the Phagocytic Energy Block and re-enter '''Phagocytic Form'''.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
