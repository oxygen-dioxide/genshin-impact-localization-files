==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Gregor:''' I'm thinking about taking a trip back to [[Mondstadt]] when I've got things covered here.
:{{DIcon}} About Mondstadt...
::'''Gregor:''' Ah, Mondstadt! My beautiful homeland, where even time seems to flow more slowly...
::'''Gregor:''' I got admitted into the [[Akademiya]] a few years ago, so I left Mondstadt and came here.
::'''Gregor:''' That was the first time I'd been away from home. I was thrilled and nervous. I looked forward to seeing exotic landscapes while also fearing that I might not be able to live on my own...
::'''Gregor:''' But after I really started my academic life here, my busy schedule has rid me of all the mixed feelings.
::'''Gregor:''' Haha, I did many stupid things when I first arrived...
::{{DIcon}} I'm all ears.
::'''Gregor:''' When I got my offer and saw the [[Azar|Grand Sage]]'s signature, I was so proud of myself. Thought it was the proof of his recognition.
::'''Gregor:''' But later I found that everyone has received the same acceptance letter with his signature on it! What a fool I was to believe that the Grand Sage saw something special in me.
::'''Gregor:''' But Sumeru is indeed different from Mondstadt. People here are more serious but less romantic.
::'''Gregor:''' For example, my [[Darshan]], [[Haravatat]], focuses on linguistics, but we seldom discuss literature. Instead, we spend a lot of time studying syntax and structure.
::'''Gregor:''' But I heard that [[Aryadeva|some people]] have been trying to organize a light novel society. Although they're not from the Akademiya, it more or less shows that the people of Sumeru aren't all so stiff and rigid.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Gregor:''' Goodbye, may the wind bless you.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Gregor:''' The wine here tastes more bitter than those from Mondstadt, but I'm used to it now.
:{{DIcon}} About the wine from your hometown...
::'''Gregor:''' Clear and cool water from [[Cider Lake]] can grant any wine a tint of sweetness...
::'''Gregor:''' *sigh* That being said, I've only had it once.
::'''Gregor:''' Before my departure, my friends and family held a banquet specially for me at the [[Cat's Tail]]. At that time, I had just come of age and was about to leave for Sumeru.
::'''Gregor:''' Later, my parents wrote in several letters that they knew some merchants who could bring me some cider.
::'''Gregor:''' But I refused for fear that my homesickness would grow stronger.
::'''Gregor:''' Thankfully my parents are both very healthy, so I don't have to worry about them when I'm away. I can be reunited with them once I graduate from here.
:{{DIcon}} Take it easy.
::'''Gregor:''' Oh... Thank you.
