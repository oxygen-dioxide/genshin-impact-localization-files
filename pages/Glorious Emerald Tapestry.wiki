|description    = Quality carpets colored with an expensive emerald dye and laced with gold commonly used in [[Sumeru]]'s buildings, depicting magnificent patterns. The fabric used in the carpet is also unmatched, supple, and tough, known to still look brand new even after one hundred years of use.<br>It is said that the design of the carpet came from a set of patterns written down by [[Alhaitham|a researcher]] while solving a puzzle. With some adjustments, you can create designs with wonderful symmetries. That researcher, now a Scribe at the [[Akademiya]], has declined to comment on the story, but this anecdote has been told many times over by merchants to emphasize the magnificence of the carpets' patterns.
