{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nobumori:''' It's another peaceful, carefree day.
:{{DIcon}} May I ask who you are?
::'''Nobumori:''' Hello! Welcome to Komore Teahouse. I am a doorman for the [[Kamisato Clan]], and I work here.
::'''Nobumori:''' That being said, I really have nothing better to do than drinking tea here... It's far more relaxed compared to the days when I still had a [[Vision]]. It's not bad. Not bad at all.
::{{DIcon}} Your Vision...?
::'''Nobumori:''' Ah, don't misunderstand. Even though I have lost my Vision, I am not actually a victim of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]]. I lost mine in a competition, fair and square.
::'''Nobumori:''' Back when I was a polearm instructor, I challenged [[Kamisato Ayato]] to a duel with polearms. Having learned the secret techniques of the [[Martial Arts in Teyvat#Kitain Arts|Kitain School]], I thought I was invincible.
::'''Nobumori:''' But as you might expect, how could I defeat Kamisato Ayato with my limited skill? After losing, I handed my Vision over.
::'''Nobumori:''' Strangely, losing the Vision felt like letting go of a heavy burden. Those obsessions I had before all disappeared. From that day forth, I no longer stepped into the Kamisato Clan estate and became a "doorman" instead.
::'''Nobumori:''' Kamisato Ayato not only has excellent swordsmanship, but has great skill with a polearm. It's really an honor that I can still serve him as an ordinary doorman.
::'''Nobumori:''' And it's not as if a peaceful life is easy to come by. As for me, I no longer need to slave away for some glittering little ball.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You've crossed blades with Kamisato Ayato...
:::'''Nobumori:''' *sigh* That was my youthful ignorance... Please forget about it.
:::'''Nobumori:''' In my current job, I probably won't be needing a sword or spear. My skills with the spear are probably of little use. If you don't mind, please accept it.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nobumori:''' Goodbye! Take care.
