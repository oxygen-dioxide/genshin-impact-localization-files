|description    = The standard guardrail used by various merchants within the [[Court of Fontaine]]. Deceptively weak in appearance but actually quite sturdy, many fit adventurers have tried to knock them down and failed.<br>The base of these guardrails utilizes differential air pressure suction to firmly adhere to clean surfaces. The ropes used are high-strength cables commonly employed by cranes to lift heavy objects. Both were products developed by a [[Fontaine Research Institute]] project team in their early years. In order to reduce and share R&D costs, relevant technologies were released to as many clients as possible to maximize the manufacturing volume of the components, including, but not limited to selling the guardrail bases and mounts for table lamps and wall sconces...<br>However, the project team eventually faced financial difficulties, going bankrupt and disbanding anyway. Even after recouping the R&D costs in full, the financial status of several projects was so dire that they were simply beyond saving...
