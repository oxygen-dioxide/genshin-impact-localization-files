|name_8 = Setsuna Shoumetsu
|desc_8 = When his shield is depleted, Shouki no Kami deploys 4 Nirvana Engines at the center of the arena. Nirvana Engines will attack the player while Shouki no Kami charges his attack. The center Nirvana Engine fires volleys of bullets that each deal '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}, while the 3 airborne Nirvana Engines periodically fire beams at the player that deal '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* When Setsuna Shoumetsu begins charging, the charging progress of Neo Akasha Terminals will be reset to 0%.
* Nirvana Engines are weakest to {{Cryo}}, {{Dendro}}, and {{Pyro}}.
* When destroyed, a Nirvana Engine will spawn a small Energy Block which will charge the Neo Akasha Terminal.
* When the Neo Akasha Terminal is fully charged, the player can use its aimed attack on Shouki no Kami to paralyze him for 30 seconds.
* While paralyzed, Shouki no Kami's chest becomes vulnerable. Shouki no Kami's [[RES]] against attacks that hit the chest will be decreased by '''170%'''. However, attacks that do not hit the chest will not receive this RES decrease.
* After Shouki no Kami is paralyzed, all party members will gain full [[Energy]].
* If the player fails to paralyze Shouki no Kami within '''40''' seconds, Setsuna Shoumetsu will land and instantly kill the active character. This ignores any defensive stats as well as [[shield]]s. In [[Co-Op Mode]], only one player will be killed, while the rest will be dealt '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* Before the landing of Setsuna Shoumetsu, all party members will have their [[Energy]] fully drained, and the active character will be frozen in place.
* It is possible to dodge Setsuna Shoumetsu using the [[Invincibility Frame|i-frames]] provided by the hold version of [[Mona]]'s [[Mirror Reflection of Doom]].
** To achieve this, the player must use an [[Elemental Burst]] around 4 seconds after the chains visual effect around the character appears to bypass the freezing effect. This will allow the player to hold Mona's Elemental Skill and i-frame Setsuna Shoumetsu with precise timing when it lands.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

==Boss Description==
{{Description|Shouki no Kami, as an artificial divinity created using all the might of [[Sumeru]]'s [[Six Darshans]], has power that rivals that of true [[god]]s.<br>But those of this world who call such a being a "false deity" misunderstand the true meaning of the word.<br>Shouki no Kami now understands countless things and shoulders unassailable might, and may be said to surpass mortals.<br>If gods must love mortals,<br>Then Shouki no Kami, who grants failure in equal measure to humanity, loves them also.<br>If gods must watch over humanity,<br>...<br>...<br>Then Shouki no Kami, who has borne witness to infinite love, hatred, partings, grudges, and maddening anger &mdash; thus does he watch over mortals.<br><br>''"Too much happiness you have had!"''<br>''"It has made you foolish. Arrogant. Horrifying in your greed."''<br>''"Let this era end!"''<br>''"Let the new god announce the defeat of the old."''<br>''"Foolish mortal... There is yet time for you to kneel."''|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Some achievements related to this boss reference the anime and manga series {{w|Neon Genesis Evangelion}}, those achievements being ''[[Dance Like You Want to Win!]]'' and ''[[It All Comes Tumbling Down]]''.
* Prior to [[Version 3.4]], this was the only Weekly Boss with a Phase 1 to Phase 2 cutscene that had a skip dialog in addition to a skip button.

===Etymology===
* {{w|Jōruri (music)|''Joururi''}} is a form of traditional Japanese narrative music, often used to accompany ''{{w|bunraku}}'', traditional Japanese puppet theater.
* The ''ki'' in {{Lang|''shouki''|ja=正機}} is short for ''kikon'' (<u>Japanese</u>: {{ja|{{w|ja:機根|機根}}|kikon}}, also known as {{ja|根機|konki}}), which is the ability to understand and practice Buddhist teachings.
* In English and many other localizations, Shouki no Kami's title has an additional name attached, "the Prodigal." It is a reference to the {{w|Parable of the Prodigal Son}}, one of the parables of {{w|Jesus Christ}} in the {{w|Bible}}, appearing in {{w|Luke 15#Parable of the Prodigal Son|Luke 15:11–32}}.
** The father, the older son, and the prodigal son bear a resemblance to the Electro Archon [[Beelzebul]] and her two "children," her creations: [[The Shogun]] and [[Scaramouche]].
*** The older son works based on law, merit, and rewards. He opposed the father due to his treatment of the returned son and lamented about how he always worked under his father's orders. This is paralleled by the puppet Shogun, who governed [[Inazuma]] based on the guidance of Eternity that Ei proclaimed, and opposed her during the events of {{Quest|Transient Dreams}} due to Ei's renewed idea of Eternity.
*** The prodigal son is paralleled by Scaramouche, who left Inazuma and experienced his own suffering at the hands of [[Dottore]], and later, [[Nahida]] and the [[Traveler]] when they defeated him.
* The term {{lang|{{zh|十惑}}|zh=十惑|ja=十惑|ko=십혹|zh_rm=shíhuò|ja_rm=juuwaku|ko_rm=sipok|sort=zh,ja,ko}} in Phase 2 Voice-Overs refers to the 10 agonies in Buddhism. The five agonies of greed, anger, stupidity, arrogance, and doubt are added to the five wrong views of identity view, extreme view, evil view, view of obsessing over evil views, and view of rigid attachment to the precepts to form it.

|2_ja_note = "Shouki" most likely refers to the {{w|Jōdo Shinshū|True Pure Land Buddhism}} belief of {{Lang|''akunin-shouki''|ja={{w|ja:悪人正機|悪人正機}}}}. According to this belief, sinners are the proper objects of salvation based on {{w|Amida|Amitābha}}'s {{w|Primal Vow}}. Thus, the title "Shouki no Kami" refers to the fact that he is a god who is a proper object of salvation. However, it should be noted that Shouki (正気)  more literally means Sanity, and comes from Shou 正 - Correct or Just and Ki 気 - Mind, Spirit, and Air, which definitely colors some of the scenes leading up to the boss reveal.
