'''''"He Never Dies"''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Duelist: Series I]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat the [[Local Legend]] {{Enemy|"He Never Dies"|text="He Never Dies" â€” Dragon Defier}} after interrupting the charging of "Ultimate Technique: Giant Undying Collision" 3 times in a single fight.

==Gameplay Notes==
* While charging, the amount of [[Poise Damage]] dealt to "He Never Dies" will be tallied. Poise Damage dealt by [[Blunt Attack]]s are multiplied by '''5''' when tallied, but a single attack cannot add more than '''800''' points to the tally. Once the tally reaches '''2500''', the charging will be interrupted and "He Never Dies" will be paralyzed for a period of time.
