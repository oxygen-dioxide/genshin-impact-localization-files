'''Fortuna''' is a term which has been used since ancient [[Fontaine]], but its meaning and significance in Fontainian culture has changed over time.

Ancient Fontainians believed that Fortuna controlled the world and described it as being woven from countless fibers, like strings on a harp.<ref name="Silk String">{{Ref/Item|Lightless Silk String}}</ref> It was later used to refer to the inevitable, cyclical nature of civilizations' rise and fall,<ref name="Enigmatic Page">{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (I)}}</ref> and was particularly used in relation to the [[God]] King [[Remus]] and his empire, [[Remuria]].<ref name="Decline">{{Ref/Book|The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria|1}}</ref> It eventually came to be understood as the name of Remus' ship, which he used to establish his empire and gather the various tribes scattered across Fontaine.<ref name="Decline 2">{{Ref/Book|The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria|2}}</ref><ref name="Secret Keepers">{{Ref/Quest|Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones}}</ref>

==Ancient Usage==
Some ancient Fontainians believed that Fortuna controlled the world. Made from strings of countless fibers, majestic music played on it would bring happiness to all; dissonance, however, would "destroy the fabric of the universe."<ref name="Silk String" /> This is likely why the Remurian Dynasty centered itself around music to a degree which baffled even ancient scholars,<ref name="Ruggiero">Interactable, Bravais' Hidden Study: [[Bravais' Hidden Study#The Research Notes of Master Ruggiero|The Research Notes of Master Ruggiero]]</ref> such as their written language resembling musical notation.<ref name="Tower Log">Interactable, Tower of Ipsissimus: Bottom: [[Tower of Ipsissimus: Bottom#Investigation Log|Investigation Log]]</ref> Remus' Grand Symphony, which aimed to unite Fontaine through a harmonious melody and suppress all "discordant sounds,"<ref name="Decline 2" /> was sometimes referred to as Fortuna. Remus himself was said to rule with the power of symphonies,<ref name="Ruggiero" /> and is referred to as the King of Fortuna at one point.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Splendor of Tranquil Waters|note=Page #2}}</ref>

Books written by an [[Golden Troupe#Lore|ancient order]], discovered by [[Rene]] sometime after the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, used Fortuna to refer to the cycle of civilizations: "Kingdoms rise and fall, and when a civilization is annihilated, a new one will be born after from the ashes."<ref name="Enigmatic Page" /> Later research into Fontaine's ancient orders, conducted by Rene's [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]], concluded that their usage of "Fortuna" was based on myth and assumption, and was not a scientifically proven phenomenon.<ref name="Tower Log" />

"Fortuna" is mentioned a total of three times in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria]]'', written about 100 years after Remuria fell.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria|3}}</ref> In Volume I, it is first mentioned while recounting how Remus "descended" on Meropis "in his golden Fortuna." Later in the same volume, it is used to describe Remuria's prophesied fall: "The greatest empire will face the most utter destruction, and this is Fortuna." In Volume II, Fortuna is the name of an imperial ship, anchored at a port located between the Ocean Pillars and a massive lighthouse-tower. The book's author, Pulteney, notes that his depiction of Remuria's history is extrapolated from the myths and superstitions that became popular after the nation's collapse, given that Remuria's sudden and swift destruction left few survivors.

==Modern Usage==
[[Wriothesley]] recounts one of the present-day versions of Remus' legend to the [[Traveler]]: Remus received a divine revelation to come to Fontaine, where he encountered the seer Sybilla in the form of a Golden Bee. Together with the Golden Bee, Remus rode on a giant golden ship named the Fortuna and created Remuria above the waves. After establishing Remuria as an empire, he sailed on the Fortuna once more to conquer every island under Remuria, calling the tribes to join the empire.<ref name="Secret Keepers" /> The Fortuna thus became known as the bringer of civilization and glory.<ref name="Wingalet">{{Ref/CS|Wriothesley|The Wingalet}}</ref>

Through inmates with academic backgrounds, Wriothesley became acquainted with the theory that the sea which once swallowed Remuria would one day rise again and destroy civilization again, and that the [[prophecy of Fontaine|prophesied flood]] is simply an extension of the idea that "oceans will rise, empires will fall."<ref name="Wingalet" /> Once he suspected that the [[Primordial Sea]], which was capable of dissolving Fontainians, was located directly below the [[Fortress of Meropide]], Wriothesley began building a massive ship inspired by the Fortuna &mdash; [[the Wingalet]] &mdash; hoping that if such a disaster came to pass, the ship would be a source of hope for others.<ref name="Secret Keepers" />
