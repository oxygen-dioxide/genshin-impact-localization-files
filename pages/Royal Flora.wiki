==Description==
A blue lily made of silky satin<br />that once served as a noblewoman's headdress.

A noble who once ruled over Mondstadt left it behind.<br />In that legendary age, the nobles were examples for the people.<br />They guided their subjects with their conduct and wisdom.<br />They were the true representation of the people of Mondstadt.<br />They were noble not only in lineage,<br />but also in their commitment to virtues and principles.

The longevity of the nobles was cut short by their endless self-indulgence.<br />Ostentation gave way to devolution.
