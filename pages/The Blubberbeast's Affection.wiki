;(Enter the underwater building or interact with the Engineer's Notes)
:'''Paimon:''' Hm? {{Traveler}}, look over there. It looks like someone left some notes...
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...During the observation of maritime creatures, a Blubberbeast pup was rescued from a [[Underwater Survey Mek|ray-style clockwork meka]] that lost control..."
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...Basic biological tests were conducted... Turned out it is much weaker than regular Blubberbeasts. If it is returned to its original habitat, the estimated chance of survival would be no more than 20%..."
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...A conclusion has been made. The Blubberbeast will be kept and taken care of in the observatory station. If it can grow up healthily, its estimated chance of survival will be increased to approximately 70%..."
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...After giving it some thought, I decided to name it 'Berrypuff.' Though it doesn't resemble berries in any way, it looked really happy when I gave it one, so Berrypuff it is."
:{{DIcon}} (Turn page.)
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...The research funds have been withdrawn by the supervisor, who said that the funds will be repurposed for something like 'An Innovative Circuit Design Using Clockwork Meka to Simulate the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game and Its Sociological Impact'..."
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...Even such nonsense can be approved. What are those people even thinking..."
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...I should've gone to [[Sumeru]] and joined the [[Amurta]] there... These guys should just become mechanisms themselves if they care about those so much!"
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "...I have no choice but to go back first... But I can't find a way to take Berrypuff with me... It can't adapt to the environment on land. I have to leave it here..."
:'''Engineer's Notes:''' "If my calculations are correct, the rest of the food should be enough to last Berrypuff and allow it to grow up healthily..."
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, the handwriting looks pretty new...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't stop wondering if the Blubberbeast in the note is doing alright... {{Traveler}}, shall we go in and check it out?

;(Approach the aquarium)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Could that be what the notebook mentioned...

;(Approach the weak Blubberbeast)
:'''Blubberbeast:''' Blub...
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the "Berrypuff" that was mentioned in the note. Poor thing, it looks so pale and haggard...
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, did that engineer really believe their calculations were correct? The food has already run out!
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] blew up because it's full of people like this... Anyway, {{Traveler}}, let's give it some food!
:'''Paimon:''' What do Blubberbeasts eat though? Hmmm... if there's some fish...
:{{DIcon}} But this area should be teeming with fish...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmmm, it could be that it's too weak to catch up to the fish... So let's try feeding it the stuff we've got instead, shall we?

:'''Berrypuff:''' (The helpless little Blubberbeast gazes at you with vigilance, though it has no more strength to run away.)
:;(Submit {{Item|Fish|x=1}})
:{{Black Screen|The Blubberbeast sniffs at the food in your hands tentatively while glancing at you warily. It does not sense malicious intent from you, and cautiously takes a bite...<br>...Though it was slightly hesitant at first, it quickly becomes ravenous, wolfing down all the food you hand to it. Seems like it has been starving for quite some time...}}
:{{Black Screen|After a while, the Blubberbeast regains its stamina and barks twice at you before clapping its belly, seemingly its way of offering thanks to a stranger...}}
:;(Berrypuff displays a Health Value of 0.5/5 Hearts)
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Heehee, it looks very happy and it's not that scared of us anymore!
:'''Paimon:''' Yes, yes, eat to your heart's content, then you'll recover!
:'''Paimon:''' Although... Paimon doesn't think we can just leave it alone... {{Traveler}}, how about we come back and check on this Blubberbeast every now and then?

;(Talk to Berrypuff again, optional)
:;(Berrypuff displays a Health Value of 1.25/5 Hearts)
:'''Berrypuff:''' ...Blub?
:{{DIcon}} (Instruct the Blubberbeast to somersault.)
::'''Berrypuff:''' (Berrypuff gazes at you with a confused look and pats its belly a couple of times. Seems it does not understand what you want...)
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Seems like Berrypuff can't grasp such a kind of movement for now, but it might be able to learn once its grown a bit more!
:{{DIcon}} (Feed the Blubberbeast.)
::'''Berrypuff:''' (Berrypuff takes a few sniffs of your food but does not eat it. Instead, it turns away...)
::'''Paimon:''' We just fed it a while ago. It is probably not hungry now. Let's come back later, {{Traveler}}.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the underwater building)
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, Paimon wonders about the Blubberbeast we fed before... Has it been eating well?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's a little concerned. Since we're passing through anyway, why not go check up on it?

;(Talk to Berrypuff)
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub blub!
:'''Paimon:''' Heehee, Berrypuff seems to be able to recognize us now!
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! It's us again! We brought you food too!
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, let's feed Berrypuff something delicious just like last time, shall we?
:'''Berrypuff:''' (For some reason, the Blubberbeast doesn't seem to be paying attention to you...)
:;(Submit {{Item|Fish|x=1}})
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why aren't you eating anymore...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it's already full?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, but Berrypuff doesn't look that energetic? If it already ate, it should be more active, right?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it doesn't like this kind of food?
::'''Paimon:''' No, that won't work! Being picky is bad! Well, Paimon wants to say that, but Berrypuff really looks pretty tired, so maybe pickiness is not the problem here...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, speaking about not being picky, it seems to be looking in that direction...
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub... blub!!!
:'''Blubberbeast:''' Blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Ahhh! There is another Blubberbeast trapped by waterweeds!
:'''Paimon:''' So that's why it's been acting weirdly. It's too worried about its partner to eat! {{Traveler}}, let's cut off the waterweeds and set its friend free!

;(Talk to Berrypuff again, optional)
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like Berrypuff is concerned about what's happening over there... Let's go and check it out, {{Traveler}}!

;(Cut the Fontemer Seagrass)
:'''Blubberbeast:''' Blub...
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub, blub!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay! Berrypuff should be fine now! Shall we go back and have a look?

;(Talk to Berrypuff)
:'''Berrypuff:''' ♪~
:'''Paimon:''' Heehee, it looks very happy! Well then, {{Traveler}}, let's give it some food!
:;(Submit {{Item|Fish|x=1}})
:{{Black Screen|This time, the Blubberbeast sniffs the food you hand over inquiringly, before swallowing it in one gulp, happily clapping its stomach afterward.}}
:{{Black Screen|The Blubberbeast circles you a few times as if in thanks and then turns around. Through the partition of crystalline transparence, it joins its kindred in something akin to a song, their voices joyous...}}
:;(Berrypuff displays a Health Value of 1.25/5 Hearts which increases to 2.5)
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that should do it!
:'''Paimon:''' It seems like it's having a lot of fun with its own kind! {{Traveler}}, maybe we should leave them be for now.

;(Talk to Berrypuff again, optional)
:;(Berrypuff displays a Health Value of 2.5/5 Hearts)
:'''Berrypuff:''' ♪~
:'''Paimon:''' Heehee, looks like you're really happy. If you recover soon, you'll be able to go out and play with your friend!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, Paimon thinks it's full already. Let's come back later.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmmm... Seeing Berrypuff eat is making Paimon hungry... {{Traveler}}, let's get Paimon some food, too!

===3rd Visit===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the underwater building)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, we're here again! Remember Berrypuff? Paimon wonders how it's been doing since then. Why don't we go pay it a visit, {{Traveler}}?

;(Enter the aquarium)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Berrypuff?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, it can't have swum out... so is it hiding somewhere? Let's look around!

;(Talk to Berrypuff behind the central rock formation)
:'''Paimon:''' Ahhh, so this is where it was hiding!
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't be afraid. It's us! {{Traveler}}, let's feed Berrypuff, just like we did before!
:'''Berrypuff:''' (The Blubberbeast looks anxious and keeps staring at a particular direction...)
:;(Submit {{Item|Fish|x=1}})
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph? Strange, it still looks like it has no appetite...
:'''Paimon:''' Its friend that was trapped by the seagrass is over there, so it shouldn't have anything to worry about, right? ...Maybe it's sick?
:{{DIcon}} There might be something troubling it on the other side...
:'''Paimon:''' Hm... We can't see it from over here. {{Traveler}}, how about we go over and take a look?

;(Talk to Berrypuff again, optional)
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like it is concerned about what's happening over there... Let's go and check it out, {{Traveler}}!

;(Exit the building)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! {{Traveler}}, look over there! A clockwork meka!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So Berrypuff wasn't eating because it's scared of this thing, huh? Well, let's chase it off!

;(Defeat the clockwork meka)
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, that should take care of it! Shall we go back and look for Berrypuff now?

;(Talk to Berrypuff)
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub?
:'''Paimon:''' Berrypuff doesn't seem to be scared now. Is it because it can sense there's no danger now?
:'''Paimon:''' Good. Let's give it some food, {{Traveler}}!
:;(Submit {{Item|Fish|x=1}})
:{{Black Screen|The Blubberbeast sniffs the food you offer and scarfs it down without hesitation before affectionately licking your hand.<br>It then swims to one side and begins a joyous chorus with its friend through the glass...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Heehee, it is getting close with us!
:'''Paimon:''' You gotta get better soon! Once you fully recover, you can go back to the sea and play with your own kind again!

;(Talk to Berrypuff again, optional)
:;(Berrypuff displays a Health Value of 3.75/5 Hearts)
:'''Berrypuff:''' ♪~
:'''Paimon:''' Heehee, it seems really happy to be with its friend!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, Paimon thinks its full already. Let's come back later.

===4th Visit===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the underwater building)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, we don't even know for sure if Berrypuff's recovered yet...
:'''Paimon:''' Since we're already here, let's pay it a visit!

;(Enter the aquarium)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Berrypuff seems a bit uneasy... Maybe it's hungry?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's feed it some food, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub blub...!
:'''Berrypuff:''' (The Blubberbeast gently bites your sleeve and looks very anxious and upset. Seems as if it is trying to pull you to a certain direction...)
:;(Submit {{Item|Fish|x=1}})
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;It's not eating at all...
:{{DIcon}} It keeps looking over at that direction...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That direction?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Paimon can't see what's going on back there clearly...
:'''Paimon:''' Strange... Berrypuff's friend is usually here, but it hasn't shown up at all today.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks she heard that Blubberbeasts can communicate using songs we can't hear...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, could it be trapped in the seagrass over there like last time? {{Traveler}}, let's go over and check it out!

;(Talk to Berrypuff again, optional)
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Its friends aren't trapped like last time, right? {{Traveler}}, let's go over and check it out!

;(Exit the building)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Another clockwork meka? Hang on a moment! Why are there so many clockwork meka here!?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no! The clockwork meka appear to be attacking that Blubberbeast! C'mon, {{Traveler}}, we've gotta save it!

;(Defeat the clockwork meka)
:'''Blubberbeast:''' ♪~
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so you're a friend of Berrypuff's, huh!
:'''Paimon:''' That's great! It should be okay now, but maybe we should follow it back, just in case.

;(Talk to Berrypuff)
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh, so it lost its appetite because it was worried about its friend!
:'''Paimon:''' But why would there be this many clockwork meka around here? And they're even attacking innocent animals... Shouldn't the Fontaine Research Institute do something about all this?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, {{Traveler}}, let's give it the food we prepared!
:'''Berrypuff:''' ♪~
:'''Paimon:''' It seems to be in much better spirits than last time! It should make a full recovery soon and return to the sea with its companion!
:;(Submit {{Item|Fish|x=1}})
:{{Black Screen|You offer some food and Berrypuff quickly swims out and unhesitatingly devours the treat. You tentatively reach out a hand to pet the little Blubberbeast. It feels softer and warmer than you expected, almost as if you're running your hands across a plush toy made from velvet.}}
:;(Berrypuff displays a Health Value of 3.75/5 Hearts which increases to 5)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe! It trusts us completely now!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like the Blubberbeast will grow up very soon! Oh, Paimon can't wait!
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't we come back to visit it again later, {{Traveler}}?

;(Talk to Berrypuff again, optional)
:;(Berrypuff displays a Health Value of 5/5 Hearts)
:'''Berrypuff:''' Blub?
:{{DIcon}} (Instruct Berrypuff to somersault.)
::;(Berrypuff does a flip)
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Berrypuff can pull off such complicated movements now!
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, our effort sure paid off! Now Berrypuff should be just fine after it returns to the sea!
:{{DIcon}} (Feed Berrypuff fish.)
::'''Berrypuff:''' (Berrypuff sniffs your food and bows its head gently to rub it against your hand, but it doesn't seem to be hungry...)
::'''Paimon:''' We just fed it a while ago. It is probably not hungry now. Let's come back later, {{Traveler}}.

===5th Visit===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the underwater building)
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, Paimon wonders how Berrypuff is doing...
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like we've gotten used to feeding it, huh? C'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's go check on it again!

;(Talk to Berrypuff)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, it's gotten so big! Maybe we should start calling it Berrypuffier!
:'''Paimon:''' And it looks really healthy too, all thanks to our hard work feeding it!
:'''Berrypuffier:''' Blub blub!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, if that is the case, perhaps we should send it back to the sea? It is its home, after all.
:'''Berrypuffier:''' Blub...?
:'''Berrypuffier:''' (The Blubberbeast seems to understand your intention and looks a bit hesitant...)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Doesn't it want to leave?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon understands. This place must already feel like home.
:'''Berrypuffier:''' Blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Heehee, it's okay! Though the sea is a vast place, you can come back anytime you want!
:'''Berrypuffier:''' ...
:{{Black Screen|You take the Blubberbeast outside...}}
:'''Berrypuffier:''' Blub... blub...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Its looking at the direction of the aquarium, no? Doesn't want to leave, huh?
:'''Berrypuffier:''' Blub... blub!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, it doesn't seem to mean that...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! Its old friend is here!
:'''Paimon:''' Even though you've grown up, you should still have fun with your friends!
:'''Paimon:''' Goodbye, Berrypuff. Take good care of yourself!
:{{Black Screen|The grown-up Blubberbeast seems a little reluctant to leave. It comes to you and gently rubs your cheek, as if saying goodbye. Before swimming away, it seems to remember something. It bows its head, bites your sleeve lightly, then raises its head again, and barks softly in the direction of the aquarium twice...}}

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Still, it was facing towards the aquarium and calling out. Maybe there's something it wants us to take a look at...
:'''Paimon:''' It seems concerning somehow... so why don't we take a look?

;(Dig near the seashell)
:;(A Luxurious Chest appears)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! This is...!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon never imagined there'd be a gift waiting for us! Hehe, it's a nice kid, isn't it? Guess our efforts haven't been wasted!
