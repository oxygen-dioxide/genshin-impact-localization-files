:{{DIcon|Idle}} Polish it again...
::{{A|VO Xona 01.ogg}} "Even the sharpest blade still needs to be polished every now and then."
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xona:''' This still needs another round of polishing... Oh, hello. Are you looking to buy? I'm afraid we're not taking new requests at the moment &mdash; things are too busy as is &mdash; but you can look at the stock we've already got.
:{{DIcon}} Are you a blacksmith?
::'''Xona:''' Indeed I am, the name's Xona, blacksmith for the Collective of Plenty. My family's worked the forge for generations &mdash; plowshares, weapons, pretty much every piece of metal in this tribe has been shaped by me or my ancestors.
::'''Xona:''' Our warriors might prefer wrestling with their bare hands, but when it comes to fighting the [[Abyss]], weapons are a must.
::'''Xona:''' I was raised at my father's forge, learning to take cold metal and work it into our traditional tribal weapons of war.
::'''Xona:''' Strong, practical, nothing flashy, that's our weapons are known for. Every blade, no matter how sharp, still relies on a warrior's strength.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Why do people from the Collective of Plenty prefer fighting with their bare hands?
:::'''Xona:''' Ah, well... That all goes back to our founder.
:::'''Xona:''' The Collective of Plenty's founder &mdash; as well as the original recipient of the [[Ancient Name]] of "Power" &mdash; was the hero [[Ahpub]], who once journeyed alongside the first [[Pyro Archon]], Lord [[Xbalanque]].
:::'''Xona:''' [[Och-Kan]], the tyrant who later went on the usurp control over the [[Grand Alliance]], was once his most trusted companion. But that was before Och-Kan became a tyrant, of course, and before he'd done anything wrong.
:::'''Xona:''' After Lord Xbalanque entered the [[Sacred Flame]], Ahpub's misplaced trust in the tyrant Och-Kan led him to accept a request from the latter, and he wound up leading an army to attack the innocent [[Children of Echoes]].
:::'''Xona:''' At that time, the chief of the Children of Echoes was [[Ixquieh|his very own sister]]. To prevent the death of ordinary soldiers, she threw herself directly onto her brother's sword, attempting to force him into taking their own lives together...
:::'''Xona:''' *sigh* Can you imaging what that must have been like? I cannot even begin to do so. Some still call the people of the Collective of Plenty stubborn, but compared to the Children of Echoes...
:::'''Xona:''' The legends claim that the siblings survived &mdash; and, having uncovered the tyrants plot to stir up discord, fled together to a distant land. Yet from that day on, the Collective of Plenty's perspective on weapons was forever transformed.
:::'''Xona:''' Of course, when battling against the Abyss, we all still rely upon our weapons &mdash; but that history is why, in daily life and combat training, we're more inclined towards fighting with our bare hands.
:::'''Xona:''' Wrestling allows people to engage in direct confrontation, an open and aboveboard contest of skill and strength, with no deadly blades or the threat of death hanging over them.
:::'''Xona:''' In a way, it's also a warning to us all. Weapons ought only to be used for righteous purposes, no to determine the outcome of disputes between us.

:{{DIcon}} About your forging materials...
::'''Xona:''' Oh? Interested the materials, are you?
::'''Xona:''' Most of the ore I have comes from the Children of Echoes. It's hard and tough, much better for forging than anything you'll find in the volcanic rock around here.
::'''Xona:''' These materials are... How should I put it? They're like the Children of Echoes themselves &mdash; obstinate and unyielding, yet loyal and dependable in battle.
::'''Xona:''' I've got [[Xilonen]] to thank for that... She's the blacksmith for the Children of Echoes. Her talents far exceed my own, and she was the one who recommended these ores to me.
::'''Xona:''' All that's to say, if you're really interested in these materials, you should pay a visit to the Children of Echoes yourself. You may well find something even better there.
:{{DIcon}} The fence here seems to be broken...
::'''Xona:''' Huh? Ah, of course! That rampaging [[Tatankasaurus]] must have smashed into the fence just now...
::'''Xona:''' Thanks for bringing it to my attention. Once I've finished forging these, I'll get to fixing it. *sigh* I hope that reckless little fella didn't hurt itself...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Xona:''' Alright then. Take care!
