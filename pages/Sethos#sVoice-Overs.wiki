|vo_05_01_tx         = Some of my elders say I'm difficult to control, like a wild animal. I actually don't disagree with that, but don't you think it's kind of an issue that they'd want to control how other people think in the first place?

|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Leadership.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = To be honest, being a leader is a little stressful, especially in the [[Temple of Silence]]. But after all the years I spent with [[Bamoun|Grandfather]], I'm at least clear in my own mind about the areas where I cannot compromise. After the Rite of Duels, and having been given the chance to make so many new friends, I now know the direction I want to take the Temple of Silence in from here on out. Don't worry &mdash; I won't mess it up.

|vo_06_01_tx         = When you approach someone while intending to ingratiate yourself with them, it often makes for a stilted conversation. It's much easier to build up a rapport by just hanging out and talking about whatever.

|vo_06_02_title      = About Us: Bonfire
|vo_06_02_quest      = Oathkeeper
|vo_06_02_friendship = 6
|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Bonfire.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = Lighting a bonfire at night keeps you warm and keeps wild animals away. To me, you're just like a bonfire.<br>Too abstract? Alright, let me put it more directly: I think of you as a good friend.

<!-- Miscellany I -->
|vo_07_01_title      = About the [[Vision]]
|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = When desert people receive a Vision, everyone will claim it's a blessing from such-and-such a god, depending on their faith. Watching them get into an argument over someone else's Vision, about who's stronger out of Lord [[Hermanubis]] and Lord [[Sobek]], is a guilty pleasure of mine.
|vo_07_01_mention    = Hermanubis, Sobek

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = If you're ever traveling in the desert, journeying by night is a good choice. It does get very cold, but you don't get as dehydrated as you would under the harsh sun. Putting on a few extra layers is way easier than spending half your journey time looking for a water source.

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = I don't know where [[Mourning Flower]]s got their name, it's quite an evocative image though. Maybe somebody saw one wilting in the sunlight and thought it looked like a person hanging their head in sorrow.

<!-- About Others -->

|vo_08_01_quest      = Oathkeeper

|vo_08_01_tx         = Cyno is truly outstanding &mdash; absolutely a worthy heir to Henrmanubis's power. As General Mahamatra, he has the utmost reverence for knowledge and wisdom. If the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence do start working together again, I'll take comfort in the fact that he's there.<br>Oh yeah, and another great thing about Cyno: You know the way he talks? It's just... so funny.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Cyno

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Tighnari]]
|vo_08_02_quest      = Oathkeeper

|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Tighnari.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Tighnari's made of strong stuff. I only found out after the fact that he doesn't cope well with the desert climate &mdash; never would've guessed from how he performed in the Rite of Duels. I was also surprised when he sent me a letter inviting me to visit [[Gandharva Ville]], saying it would be a good chance to meet some of Cyno's friends. Are those guys always such a hoot with their jokes? Dinner with them must be hilarious &mdash; I can't wait!
|vo_08_02_mention    = Tighnari,Cyno

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Alhaitham]] and [[Kaveh]]

|vo_08_03_tx         = I saw those two at the [[Lambad's Tavern|tavern]] once. And another time at the [[Puspa Café|cafe]]. ...Actually, I think I saw them once at the [[Grand Bazaar]], too. The architect guy, he's always talking in a hushed tone &mdash; I guess he doesn't want people to hear, but uh... Okay, it's not like I purposely listen in, it's just... Something about those two guys hanging out together, you just can't look away.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Alhaitham,Kaveh

|vo_08_04_title      = About the [[Wanderer]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Wanderer.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Who is that guy, anyway? A foreign exchange student, or something? He has a pretty incredible hat, never seen anything like it. I tried to get a closer look once, but then I blinked and he was gone. Shame. I won't let him get away next time, though. I also hear he has some pretty interesting ideas... Gotta have a chat with him sometime!
|vo_08_04_mention    = Wanderer

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Dehya]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Dehya.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Flame-Mane... everyone in the desert knows that name. [[The Eremites]] aren't exactly saints, as I'm sure you know, but Dehya's one of the few solid and dependable ones out there. If you ever want to explore the [[Great Red Sand]], Dehya's the second-best guide you could ask for. First-best being me, obviously.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Dehya

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Candace]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Candace.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = Have you ever experienced Candace's hospitality? She cooks very generous portions &mdash; even I could barely finish. So long as you're on the receiving end of her hospitality and not her wrath, you'll live a long and happy life.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Candace

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Faruzan]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Faruzan.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = It's so rare to meet someone even more chummy than me! One minute I was taking a stroll near the Akademiya, the next minute she'd taken me on as a student, and was insisting on giving me a tour. She gave me a real fright, though, because she said that if I joined [[Haravatat]], I'd get the 20-tongues language-learning package, mastery of all 100% guaranteed... I asked around, and it seems like that's just an in-joke among Akademiya students &mdash; there is no 20-language graduation requirement after all. But I don't get it... how is that funny? It's only gonna put people off studying there.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Faruzan

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Nilou]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Nilou.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = I usually can't stay still for more than a few minutes, but [[Zubayr Theater]] is one place I don't mind just standing and watching while Nilou dances on the stage. It's a rare skill to be able to bring people such a sense of peace.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Nilou

I never make a note of the exact combination of ingredients though, so I usually end up with one-off recipes. What do you think? Any interest in trying one of my limited-edition, one-time-only delicacies?

|vo_09_05_tx         = I've lived in the Temple of Silence for as long as I can remember, and to be honest, I've never had many of my own decisions to make. I'm still not sure if withstanding the power of Hermanubis was a blessing or a curse, but it definitely gave me a higher purpose in life.<br>There's a million things you can regret in life, so I'm just happy I was able to bring that one situation to a close. I'm sure Grandfather will rest in peace knowing that I got to become the leader of the Temple of Silence, and that Hermanubis's power has finally found a home.

The first time I spent the night in the rainforest, I didn't realize that I should've brought a waterproof groundsheet... That was a miserable night.

|vo_10_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_03_tx         = I like mixing spices &mdash; but only because it makes meat taste better. It's a means to an end.
