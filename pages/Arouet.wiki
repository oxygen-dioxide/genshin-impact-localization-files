==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arouet:''' Welcome to Café Lutece. Here we have the most bitter coffees and the sweetest cakes, with guests astute and absurd.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Tell me about the sweet stuff...
::'''Arouet:''' Every bite is as sweet as a Melusine's smile.
:;(Opens the Café Lutece Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the bitter...
::'''Arouet:''' Every customer has different tastes in coffee, and I shall satisfy them as I am able.
::'''Arouet:''' But if someone were to order a coffee without a trace of bitterness, well, then, my abilities would be quite limited.
::'''Arouet:''' In such circumstances, I would ask them to go to the Palais Mermonia or Salon Caritat, and speak to the first lady or gentleman they meet.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Thanks, but I'll pass.
:::'''Arouet:''' You seem like a sensible person.
:::'''Arouet:''' But for me, sensibility and sobriety are different concepts.
:::'''Arouet:''' I always welcome customers who are sensible and wish them a happy and sweet day.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Conch Madeleine|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} About the astute and the absurd...
::'''Arouet:''' As you see, ours is a cafe and not a tavern.
::'''Arouet:''' There are some gentlemen here who will speak of all manner of things while resting &mdash; and I find myself wishing that they said them with the excuse of being drunk.
::'''Arouet:''' I fear that what people say when sober might be even more absurd than the babblings of drunkards.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Arouet:''' Take care. Please come again.
