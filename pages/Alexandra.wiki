:'''Przheva:''' The new business deal's not confirmed yet?
:'''Alexandra:''' The cargo ship's been found, but I haven't found a suitable harbor, so the ship can't dock and unload for now...
:'''Przheva:''' *sigh* We have to hurry. We can't leave the cargo for too long.
:'''Alexandra:''' How will we handle the batch of goods that doesn't have confirmed buyers after the ship arrives?
:'''Przheva:''' Hm, when the time comes, we will dispose of that batch of old goods.
:'''Przheva:''' But it still depends on how much cargo that ship is carrying...
