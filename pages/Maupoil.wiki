{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maupoil:''' How come there are so many people working, and yet there's still so much work to do?
:{{DIcon}} About a guard's duties...
::'''Maupoil:''' Oh, I don't have any complaints about working as a guard. I just wish people would be more diligent in their work, that's all.
::'''Maupoil:''' [[Estienne]] in particular... I sometimes feel scared he's going to have another one of his so-called "bright ideas." If he has to have them, I wish he'd do it while I'm on vacation... a long vacation.
::{{DIcon}} Why not take a vacation?
::'''Maupoil:''' But I haven't finished my work yet... I know that everything in the Fortress will keep running without me. But I can't stop worrying...
::'''Maupoil:''' I need to see everything resolved with my own eyes, and ideally solve each problem personally! It's the only way I can get a good night's sleep.
::{{DIcon}} But will the work ever be finished?
::'''Maupoil:''' Of course not. So I can't stop working and I can't get a good night's sleep either.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your time.
::'''Maupoil:''' I'd better get on with my work.
