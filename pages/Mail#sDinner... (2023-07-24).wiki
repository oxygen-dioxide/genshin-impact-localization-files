|text      = Do you already have dinner plans? Let me treat you to a meal!

Don't worry, there's no hidden snares here. Our friendship is stable and mature, but we still need a bit of "declension" every now and then, to help it shine with the radiance of a freshly-cut gemstone. After all, since you've been helping me out for so long, I should have found an opportunity to return the favor long ago… My my, this invitation is starting to sound like some sort of long-premeditated plot.

Though if we do want to talk about "plots"... I've heard detective novels are quite popular in Fontaine, so if you get a chance in the future, don't mind bringing me back a couple? I'd like to try my hand at guessing the culprit. But there's always a gap between fiction and reality, so if I guess wrongly, try not to be too disappointed in me, okay? 

Oh, right, I've already informed the restaurant as to your dietary preferences and tastes. So no need to worry, just relax and enjoy the meal.
