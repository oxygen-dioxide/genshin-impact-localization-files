|text1  = You must equip your Kamera and interact with the photo-taking point(s) to enter Photo-Taking Mode.<br />The process is split into an adjustment phase where you determine the photo's settings, and a photo-taking phase in which you can move and use your Skills.
|image2 = Tutorial Windblumes Breath Breezy Snapshots 2.png
|text2  = During the adjustment phase, you need to first select your Kamera Settings and then proceed to adjust the position and angle of the photo.<br />Take note that the {{Color|help|photo-taking point(s)}} must be within the Kamera frame. Once you have confirmed your settings, it's time to move on to the photo-taking phase.
|image3 = Tutorial Windblumes Breath Breezy Snapshots 3.png
|text3  = During the photo-taking phase, the angle of the finalized image will be decided by the settings you adjusted previously.<br />During the photo-taking process, the direction of the shoot will be indicated by the Reflector Beam.
|image4 = Tutorial Windblumes Breath Breezy Snapshots 4.png
|text4  = If you wish to adjust your Kamera Settings again, you can tap Pause Challenge and return to your preset, thus starting the setting adjustment process over again.<br />Once you have finished taking a photo, if you wish to continue taking pictures using the current settings, you can tap Keep Taking Photos to return to the photo-taking phase.

|"If you want me to identify the part of Mondstadt's wilds I consider the most concerning... That's got to be Dadaupa Gorge. Not only do many hilichurls gather there, but someone also stuck all those swords into the ground in the middle of the valley... If you don't mind, Traveler, could you help me take a photo of that place...? Uh, whoops, that sounded a bit too much like a commission... *cough* But either way, I'm counting on you! Eh? That still sounds like a commission, you say?"
----
'''Completed'''<br />"Ooh, this is wonderful! Thank you, Traveler! I'll be giving your compensation as per the Guild's rules... Ahem, I was just kidding. This isn't a commission from the Guild or anything, but thank you anyway!"

If you could get lucky and get a shot of that creature... Well, I mean, your personal safety takes priority, of course, so do be careful all the same."

I've only been able to take pictures of it from afar... *sigh* Perhaps I should bring some friends along with me next time. Maybe Cyrus will agree then..."
----
'''Completed'''<br />"Dragonspine doesn't look half as dangerous as Cyrus made it out to be... Huh? There are monsters hiding in the shadows, and it's so cold you could get frozen in place? R—Really? You're not lying, are you?"

Either way, I've heard that the view there is pretty good, and that such pictures do well in picture collections, so, uh, please and thank you, Traveler. As for me... I need to engage in some friendly discussions with Cyrus for myself and a few other adventurers to be allowed to visit Dragonspine together and take some photos ourselves..."
----
'''Completed'''<br />"Nope, no wyrms at all. But that's fine! The photo you took is nice enough. I'm sure Cyrus would love it too."
