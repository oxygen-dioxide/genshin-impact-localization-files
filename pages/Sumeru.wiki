{{Description|The city of scholars located in the west-central part of Teyvat.<br />A fantastical nation of both lush rainforest and barren desert, where countless fruits of wisdom grow and are buried. Whether Travelers travel from afar through the forest to reach the academy city or delve deep into the desert to discover the historical ruins of the red desert, a wealth of valuable knowledge awaits them here.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Genshin Impact Official Website]}}
'''Sumeru''' is one of the seven regions in [[Teyvat]]. It is the nation that worships [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], the [[Dendro]] [[Archon]].

It is renowned as the center of learning and houses the [[Sumeru Akademiya]].

Access to Sumeru is unlocked after completing the [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]]: Act I - [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]].

[[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter III]]: Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana takes place in this region.

{{Quote|The God of Wisdom's enemy is wisdom itself, and the oasis of knowledge is a mirage in the desert of ignorance. In the city of scholars there is a push for folly, yet the God of Wisdom makes no argument against it.|[[Dainsleif]]|Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail<ref name="tcsp">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]</ref>}}

==Description==
Sumeru's landscape features both deserts<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Parched Stone}}</ref> and forests.<ref name="colv2">{{Ref/Book|Customs of Liyue|2|Receiving God}}</ref><ref name="Lisa5">{{Ref/CS|Lisa|5}}</ref> In the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview, Dainsleif likens it to a desert, and [[Liben]] mentions that "Sumeru is all rainforest and desert".

500 years ago, during the [[Timeline#500|cataclysm]], the previous Dendro Archon, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, was slain<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Viridescent Venerer}}</ref> and the current God of Wisdom took her place.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> Under the aegis of the God of Wisdom, the sages of Sumeru drive themselves into hysterics and abandon all that is worldly in their pursuit of esoteric wisdom.<ref name="colv2" />

[[Lisa]] went to study magic at the Sumeru Akademiya, where she was considered the best student they had seen in 200 years. Despite the prestige she enjoyed there, she ultimately returned to [[Mondstadt]] after growing disillusioned with the "raving-mad scholars" and the cost of "uninhibited erudition" she witnessed in Sumeru.

The [[Eremite]] are a faction of mercenaries from Sumeru who travel throughout Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}</ref> They see themselves as people who are not "afraid of dying so that they might truly live."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Valor's Afterglow (Quest)}}</ref> [[Nazafarin]], a scholar from Sumeru, claims that some of its members wield "bizarre yet formidable powers," and finds the subject of the Eremite unpleasant enough to swiftly drop the subject after briefly explaining them to the [[Traveler]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Visitor From Westward Realms}}</ref>

Sumeru's [[Statue of the Seven]] depicts a female figure who appears to be a child.<ref>Official reveal trailer for Sumeru from the Genshin Impact [[Version/2.8|Version 2.8]] Livestream.</ref> She is shown to be wearing a similar cloak and draping clothing similar to the other known Archon statues. Her small frame is also shown sitting on a huge leaf, an attribute owing to her mantle as the Dendro Archon.

==Notable Features==
Sumeru features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards. Some are found only in [[Dharma Forest]], some only in the [[Great Red Sand]], and some are common to both:

===Common===
* [[Dendroculus|Dendroculi]] can be offered at [[Statue of The Seven|Statues of the Seven]] in Sumeru for rewards.
* [[Dendrogranum|Dendrograna]] augment [[Charged Attack]]s and [[Charged Attack#Aimed Shots|Aimed Shots]] with a {{Dendro}}-based attack. Dendrogranum attacks are the only way to destroy [[Dendrogranum-Locked Rock]]s, Fetid Boughs, and Withering Branches and trigger [[Valaya]]. They are summoned at [[Auspicious Branch]]es.
* [[Energy Block]]s are used to power relays within some [[Ruin Golem|Ruin Golems]].
* [[Four-Leaf Sigil]]s permit the player to rapidly traverse the terrain and travel to areas that may otherwise be difficult to reach.
* [[Primeval Rosin]] is used to unlock paths in [[Domain]]s.
* [[Stamina Flower]]s (''unofficial name'') grant 80 [[Stamina]] when approached.
* [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s can change between different states when an [[Element]] is applied: Scorched (inactive) from {{Pyro}}, Normal from {{Dendro}}, and Activated from {{Electro}}:
** [[Bouncy Mushroom]]: Launches the player into the air (higher when Activated).
** [[Dream Flower]]: Clears enemy [[Aggravation|Aggro]] for nearby players (Normal) and reveals Phantasmal Seeds (Activated).
** [[Fungus]]: Dropped items on defeat will change depending on state.
** [[Poisonous Mushroom]]: Attacks with {{Dendro}} when not Scorched.
** [[Rocklifting Branch]]: Rises from the ground in Normal state, revealing hidden objects underneath (rises higher when Activated)
** [[Seed Mirror]]: Reveals Nascent Withering Zones (Normal), reveals [[Mischievous Aranara]] (Activated).
** [[Starshroom]]: Restore [[health]] when consumed: 1 HP (Scorched), 300 HP (Normal), 800 HP (Activated).
** [[Tri-Yana Seed]]: Can be immobile (Scorched), moving (Normal), or reveal hidden objects (Activated).
* [[The Withering]] is a [[climate]] effect that causes dangerous areas called Withering Zones, which apply Decay to the player. If the player accumulates 10 units of Decay, all their characters will [[Fallen Character|fall]]. The player must use [[Dendrogranum|Dendrograna]] to destroy all Withering Branches within the zone, defeat the enemies that spawn, then interact with the Tumor of the Withering to permanently eliminate the Withering Zone.
** Fetid Boughs may attack the player, doing damage and applying a unit of Decay when hit.
** [[Flame of Life|Flames of Life]] may appear within the zone, which remove one unit of Decay when consumed.
** [[Seelie#Seelies of Life|Seelies of Life]] (''unofficial name'') and [[Candle of Life|Candles of Life]] can continually remove accumulated Decay for nearby players, as will any [[Teleport Waypoint]] that happens to be located within the zone.

===Dharma Forest=== 
* [[Ashvattha's Concourse]]s are locations that each contain a [[Vasara Tree]] that is infected with [[The Withering]]. The player must cleanse these areas during the ''[[Dream Nursery]]'' [[World Quest]] series.
* Applying {{Dendro}} to [[Clusterleaf of Cultivation|Clusterleaves of Cultivation]] will spawn [[Four-Leaf Sigil]]s that will last for 24 hours.
* [[Energy Extraction Device]]s are challenges found in [[The Eremites|Eremite]] camps. You must find control keys and defeat enemies to deactivate them.
* [[Nursery|Nurseries]] are puzzles that grant a [[Vasmrti]] and a [[Chest]] when solved.
* [[Stone Pillar Seal]]s can be neutralized with {{Pyro}} to release [[Ruin Machine]]s.
* Playing the [[Vintage Lyre]] can activate various objects, once the corresponding song has been unlocked:
** Remove obstacles near [[Claustroflora]]
** Repair {{Dendro}} [[Elemental Monument]]s (can also be repaired using the [["Kusava"]])
** Gain access to [[Domain]]s via [[Gloomy Path]]s
** Switch between the real and dream worlds at [[Silapna]]
** Summon a [[Dendrogranum#Healthy Dendrograna|Healthy Dendrograna]] at [[Sprouting Branch]]es
** Rotate [[Vamadha]]
** Activate [[Varuna Contraption]]s, enabling the player to change the weather in [[Apam Woods]]
** Unlock challenges at [[Phantasmal Gate]]s
** Please [[Music-Loving Aranara]]

=== Great Red Sand===
* Atmospheric Vortices come in [[Small Atmospheric Vortex|small]] and [[Large Atmospheric Vortex|large]] varieties. They function as walls which push the player back on contact but do no damage. Touching one with [[Jinni in the Magic Bottle — Liloupar]] equipped drains some of the Jinni's Might from the bottle and dispels the Vortex. Large Vortices require the bottle to be upgraded to level 6. Jinni's Might can be replenished at [[Jinn Shrine|Jinn Shrines]].
* [[Cascade Spout|Cascade Spouts]] emit sand into [[Cascade Pool|Cascade Pools]]. They can be toggled on and off with attacks. Completely filling all the Pools in a puzzle area with sand grants a [[Chest]].
* There are three [[Memories of Pairidaeza|Flower Buds]] ''(unofficial name)'' which exist only in the [[Eternal Oasis]]. Touching one causes it to move along a trail of purple flowers to specific locations, where you can select ''Activate Memory'' to cause changes in the environment which can unblock the Bud's path and reveal [[Chests]]. Leading each Bud to its destination grants a '''Memories of the Eternal Oasis''' ([[Memories of the Eternal Oasis (I)|I]], [[Memories of the Eternal Oasis (II)|II]], [[Memories of the Eternal Oasis (III)|III]]) item and another [[Chest]].
* [[Illusory Keystone]]s are platforms that disappear a few seconds after the player steps on them.
* [[Loose Sand Pile]]s can cover objects or enemies. They can be dispersed with {{Anemo}} or by an obscured enemy who senses the player's presence.
* [[Manifestation Mechanism and Signal Spirit|Manifestation Mechanisms]] can be activated to release a Signal Spirit. Escort the Spirit to each Mechanism in a chain. Bringing the Spirit to the final Mechanism grants a [[Chest]].
* [[Mysterious Mural]]s appear in pairs. Interacting with one at night spawns enemies. Defeating all enemies spawned by both murals grants a [[Chest]].
* [[Primal Obelisk]]s can be used to locate [[Sacred Seal]]s, which can then be returned to the Obelisk. Returning all of an Obelisk's Seals grants a Precious [[Chest]].
* Ruin Devices are mostly found within and around temples. Each device has a clearance requirement that you must fulfill by upgrading the [[Scarlet Sand Slate]].
** [[Everlight Cell]]s can be moved or rotated to cause [[Primal Beam]]s to strike targets called [[Neverlight Cell]]s. Some Everlight Cells revert to their original state a certain amount of time after the player interacts with them. Dual Everlight Cells emit two beams, and Dual Neverlight Cells must be struck by two beams to activate. Sometimes an obstructing wall may need to be made transparent by activating nearby [[Obscuring Cell]]s.
** [[Large Fan Blades]] may cycle between active and inactive states automatically, or be controlled by a [[Plinth of the Secret Rites]]. While active, they can push the player or obliterate [[Primal Ember]]s.
** [[Pipe Diverter Valve|Pipe Diverter Valves]] can adjust pipe connections, changing the flow of sand within them.
** [[Plinth of the Secret Rites|Plinths of the Secret Rites]] can be used to perform various actions, such as opening doors, removing [[Primal Barrier]]s, or turning [[Large Fan Blades]] on and off. Different Plinths require varying levels of clearance.
** [[Primal Barrier]]s are forcefield-like obstacles that must be turned off to allow the player to pass.
** Flipping a [[Primal Sandglass]] reveals the locations of other nearby Sandglasses. After a certain amount of time, a flipped Sandglass will flip back. Usually, getting all nearby Sandglasses in the flipped state at once will complete the puzzle. Sometimes, the Sandglasses are simply part of a larger puzzle that spawns objects such as [[Four-Leaf Sigil]]s while any nearby Sandglass is flipped.
** [[Primal Ember]]s can be located resting within [[Primal Sconce]]s. Interacting with one causes it to move along a predefined path. The Ember may stop at another sconce until the player interacts with it again, or at other locations, waiting until the player approaches. Leading the Ember to a [[Primal Torch]] causes the Torch to activate. Often there will be multiple Torches in a room which must be activated to solve a puzzle.
** [[Prism of Khaj-Nisut|Prisms of Khaj-Nisut]] can glow blue or red, and are used to control objects of the same color. You can also interact with them to change their color and colors of other objects.
** [[Replicator Keystone]]s can be activated with [[Forged Primal Light]] to create ruin devices.
** [[Rune Mechanism|Rune Mechanisms]] emit a beam of energy that can remove sand piles. Attack them to change the beam's direction. Some are mounted on tracks which allow them to be moved. The energy may be blocked by a [[Runic Window]], which can be opened by using a [[Runic Pane Switch]].
** Activating [[Verity Cell]]s causes hidden objects near the player to be revealed for a limited time.
* Intermittent [[Sandstorm in the Desert of Hadramaveth|Sandstorms]] reduce visibility in the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]]. Intensity increases with proximity to the heart of the storm. The Jinni in the Magic Bottle — Liloupar predicts when a sandstorm is approaching and significantly improves visibility in a sandstorm when equipped. If the magic bottle has been upgrade to at least level 5, the player can summon or dispel Sandstorms at the branch within any [[Jinn Shrine]].
* [[Tutorial/Suda's Flow|Suda's Flow]] manifests as glowing orbs surrounded by vines, only appearing inside the [[Ruin Golem (Valley of Dahri)|Ruin Golem]] in the [[Valley of Dahri]]. Any attack destroys them, and destroying all the ones associated with a seal removes the seal.
* [[Tumbleweed]]s can be found rolling across the [[Great Red Sand]]. Running into one will destroy it, sometimes releasing an item.
* [[Weathered Obelisk|Weathered Obelisks]] come in groups, with each Obelisk having a matching one nearby. With each pair of Obelisks, one has a symbol that can be changed with an attack, while the other does not change. Make all changeable Obelisks in a group match their pairs to solve the puzzle.
* [[Weathered Rock|Weathered Rocks]] can be damaged by [[Wenut]] attacks.

==Trivia==
*Sumeru may have been inspired by medieval Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures.
**Sumeru is one of the many names of {{Lang|{{w|Mount Meru}}|sa=मेरु}}, a sacred five-peaked mountain in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist cosmology.
***The Chinese name for Sumeru, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=须弥|zh_rm=Xūmí}}, is also the Chinese name for Mount Meru.
** Sumeru's name may also be derived from {{w|Sumer}}, the earliest known civilization located in lower {{w|Mesopotamia}}, which was known as Šumeru in the Akkadian language.
***{{w|Babylon}}, the capital city of the Mesopotamian {{w|Babylonia}}n empire, was known as the center of learning and scientific advancement during its prime, similar to Sumeru being known for its Akademiya.
**{{w|Zoroastrianism}} and the {{w|Avestan}} language are prominently featured in relation to [[Sumeru Akademiya]], particularly in its titles for students and researchers and the names of its six main schools, the Six Darshans, which are each named after one of the {{w|Amesha Spenta}}.
*** Lesser Lord Kusanali, the current Dendro Archon, is described as the provider of "Anahitian Blessing." In Zoroastrianism, {{w|Anahita}} (Anāhīd/Nahid) was a goddess of "the Waters" and subsequently associated with fertility, healing, and wisdom.<ref>Encyclopaedia Iranica: [https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/anahid Anahid]</ref>
**Ideology of {{W|Dharmic religion}}- {{W|Hinduism}} and {{W|Buddhism}} are prominently featured in Sumeru Quests, in the nomenclature of some areas and sub-areas, plants and items indigenous to Sumeru rainforest, and in the storyline where a lot of inspirations can be seen from these religions indigenous to Indian Subcontinent. The three gods of Sumeru- The Godess of Flowers, The Godess of Wisdom-Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and The God of Destruction-King Deshret is more likely to be inspired from the {{W|Trimurti}}-the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism-in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities. Some NPCs also have names of Vedic origin.
*** The names of Vedic deities are portrayed on Sumeru's history and storyline- for instance {{W|Varuna}} the Hindu God of Hydrosphere is eminent throughout the Sumeru world quest- [[Aranyaka]](for wiki, refer {{W|Aranyaka}}). The names of Dendro Archons- Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and Lesser Lord Kusanali are some names eminent in Dharmic religions.
**Sumeru music is a mix of both South Asian(esp. Indian {{W|Hindustani classical music}}) and Middle-Eastern music. In some areas, {{W|Yoga}} music is also played. The desert region is mostly based on ancient Egypt and so is the music.
**Some Vedic (Indian) inspiration can be seen in the name of Sumeru's featured Act in ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', which is titled {{Lang|''Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana''|zh=虚空劫灰往世书|zh_rm=|zh_tl=The Purana of the Void's Ashes From The Calamity.}}
***{{lang|{{w|Puranas}}|zh=往世书|sa=पुराण|sa_rm=purāṇa}} are a genre of Indian literature that covers a wide array of subjects, typically relating to legends and other traditional lore. It is also a Hindi word meaning "old" in a nostalgic or memorable context.
***The term {{Lang|mini=1|zh=劫|zh_rm=jié}} may be short for {{Lang|mini=1|zh=劫波}} {{Lang|zh=<wbr>|zh_rm=jiébō|och=<wbr>|och_rm=*kab *paːl}}, a Sanskrit loanword from {{Lang|"kalpa"|sa=कल्प}}. In Hindu and Buddhist cosmology, a {{w|Kalpa_(aeon)|kalpa}} is an immense period of time, generally between the creation and recreation of a world or universe. Therefore, an alternate translation for the phrase {{zh|劫灰|rm=jiéhuī}} can also be "kalpa ash," referring to the ashes left behind at the destruction of a world at the end of a kalpa.<ref>Chinese Wikisource: [[wikisource:zh:佛学大辞典/劫灰|{{zh|劫灰（佛学大辞典）}}]]</ref>
**Several NPCs, mentioned or historical characters, and clans have names inspired by prominent figures from the {{w|Islamic Golden Age}}, such as the [[House of Purbiruni#Trivia|House of Purbiruni]] ({{w|al-Biruni}}), the [[House of Pursina#Trivia|House of Pursina]] ({{w|Avicenna|Ibn Sina}}), [[Alhaitham#Trivia|Alhaitham]] ({{w|Ibn al-Haytham}}), and Firnas ({{w|Abbas ibn Firnas}}).
*Sumeru's local specialty wine is frigid snake wine.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moonfinger}}</ref>
*A bubble universe known as "Seed of Sumeru" also exists in ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', ''[[HoYoverse]]''{{'}}s previous game.
*In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "Sub floreis lumen sagacitatis," meaning "Under the flowery light of sagacity."
