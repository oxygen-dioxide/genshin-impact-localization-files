'''Sumeru''' is one of the seven regions in [[Teyvat]]. It is the region that worships the God of Wisdom, the [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]].<ref name="C2A3P9">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref><ref group="Note">In the Chinese version of [[Wishes (Quest)|Wishes]], Yae Miko says: {{Lang|"Oh, so it wasn't clear to you guys yet? 'Lesser Lord Kusanali' is precisely the god whom the people of Sumeru place their faith in; it's the Sumeru people's term of endearment for her."|zh=欸，原来你们还不清楚吗，「小吉祥草王」便是须弥所信仰的神明，是须弥人对她的爱称。}} In context, Yae Miko's first remark expresses her surprise that Paimon didn't make the connection between the God of Wisdom she mentioned a few lines earlier, and the title "Lesser Lord Kusanali" that she had just mentioned.</ref><ref group="Note">Shortly after the release of Version 2.1, which revealed Lesser Lord Kusanali uses female pronouns, all localizations that previously used male pronouns for the God of Wisdom (or God of Dendro) were revised to use female pronouns, with the following in-game update note:<br />''Fixes textual errors in German, English, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Portuguese, Russian, and Thai translations of some quests and dialogues that mention or relate to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Text-related fixes for English are as follows:<br />The original reference to the personal pronoun was: "He." It will now be corrected to "She." Original description: "Lesser Lord Kusanali (He/Him)." Revised description: "Lesser Lord Kusanali (She/Her)."''<br />This was the first time a change to a character's pronouns was both publicly announced and changed over a large number of localizations at once, which indicates that these localizations incorrectly assumed male pronouns for the God of Wisdom and were directed to switch to female pronouns. A similar situation has previously occurred in the English localization: [[Breeze Amidst the Forest]] originally used male pronouns for [[Gold]], then quietly changed to gender-neutral (they/them) pronouns with revelations in [[Version 1.2]] that suggested Albedo's master, the female alchemist [[Rhinedottir]], may be linked to Gold.</ref> As of now, an ominous aura lingers in it and is currently a dangerous place.<ref>Event [[Marvelous Merchandise/2022-05-06|Marvelous Merchandise 2022-05-06]] NPC Dialogue: [[Marvelous Merchandise/2022-05-06/Story#Dialogue|Liben]]</ref>

It is renowned as the center of learning and houses the [[Sumeru Akademiya]].

Characters that are currently known to be within Sumeru Akademiya are [[Cyno]] (Mentioned in the [[Manga|Webtoon]] and The Genshin Impact Teyvat Travail Trailer) and [[Collei]], who followed him to Sumeru in the last few chapters of the manga.

[[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter III]]: Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana takes place in this region.

{{Quote|The God of Wisdom's enemy is wisdom itself, and the oasis of knowledge is a mirage in the desert of ignorance. In the city of scholars there is a push for folly, yet the God of Wisdom makes no argument against it.|[[Dainsleif]]|Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail<ref name="tcsp">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]</ref>}}

==Description==
Sumeru's landscape features both deserts<ref>Furnishing: [[Parched Stone]]</ref> and forests.<ref name="colv2">{{Ref/Book|Customs of Liyue|2|Receiving God}}</ref><ref name="Lisa5">{{Ref/CS|Lisa|5}}</ref> In the Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview, Dainsleif likens it to a desert, and [[Liben]] mentions that ''"Sumeru is all rainforest and desert"''.

500 years ago, during the [[Timeline#500|cataclysm]], the previous Dendro Archon was slain<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Viridescent Venerer}}</ref> and the current God of Wisdom took their place.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> Under the aegis of the God of Wisdom, the sages of Sumeru drive themselves into hysterics and abandon all that is worldly in their pursuit of esoteric wisdom.<ref name="colv2"/>

[[Lisa]] went to study magic at the Sumeru Akademiya, where she was considered the best student they had seen in 200 years. Despite the prestige she enjoyed there, she ultimately returned to [[Mondstadt]] after growing disillusioned with the "raving-mad scholars" and the cost of "uninhibited erudition" she witnessed in Sumeru.

The [[Eremite]] are a faction of mercenaries from Sumeru who travel throughout Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}</ref> They see themselves as people who are not "afraid of dying so that they might truly live."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Valor's Afterglow (Quest)}}</ref> [[Nazafarin]], a scholar from Sumeru, claims that some of its members wield "bizarre yet formidable powers," and finds the subject of the Eremite unpleasant enough to swiftly drop the subject after briefly explaining them to the [[Traveler]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Visitor From Westward Realms}}</ref>

<!-- DO NOT SAY THIS IS LESSER LORD KUSANALI UNTIL WE HAVE CONFIRMATION OF WHO THE STATUE AND/OR LESSER LORD KUSANALI IS -->Sumeru's [[Statue of the Seven]] depicts a female figure who appears to be a child.<ref>Official reveal trailer for Sumeru from the Genshin Impact [[Version/2.8|Version 2.8]] Livestream.</ref> She is shown to be wearing a similar cloak and draping clothing similar to the other known Archon statues. Her small frame is also shown sitting on a huge leaf, an attribute owing to her mantle as the Dendro Archon.

==Trivia==
* Sumeru may have been inspired by medieval Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures.
** Sumeru is one of the many names of {{w|Mount Meru}}, a sacred five-peaked mountain in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist cosmology.
*** The Chinese name for the region Sumeru, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=须弥|zh_rm=Xūmí}}, is also the Chinese name for Mount Meru.
** Sumeru's name may also be derived from {{w|Sumer}}, the earliest known civilization located in lower {{w|Mesopotamia}}, which was known as Šumeru in the Akkadian language.
*** {{w|Babylon}}, the capital city of the Mesopotamian {{w|Babylonia}}n empire, was known as the center of learning and scientific advancement during its prime, similar to Sumeru being known for its Akademiya.
*** Links have been made between the Sumerian civilization and the {{w|Zhangzhung}} civilization in western Tibet that greatly influenced Tibetan Buddhism.<ref>China's Tibetannet: [http://m.tibet3.com/Culture/dxgj/2018-12-03/95020.html {{Lang|mini=1|zh=苏美尔文明与象雄文明比较中藏族历史源头新探}}]</ref>
** The act of the Archon Quests set in Sumeru featured in the Teyvat Storyline trailer is entitled {{Lang|"Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana"|zh=虚空劫灰往世书|zh_rm=|zh_tl=The Purana of the False Kalpa of Disintegration}}, referencing {{w|puranas}}, a genre of Indian literature that covers a wide array of subjects, typically relating to legends and other traditional lore. It is also a Hindi word meaning "old" in a nostalgic or memorable context.
*** The term {{Lang|mini=1|zh=空劫|zh_rm=}} refers to the Kalpa of Disintegration (also translated as the Kalpa of Nothingness), the fourth {{w|Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa}} in Buddhist cosmology that lasts between the destruction of the world at the previous kalpa to the creation of a new world.<ref>Nichiren Buddhism Library: [https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/K/18 空劫]</ref> {{Lang|mini=1|zh=劫|zh_rm=}} is short for {{Lang|mini=1|zh=劫波|zh_rm=}} {{Lang|zh=<wbr>|zh_rm=Jiébō|och=<wbr>|och_rm=*kab *paːl}}, a Sanskrit loanword {{Lang|sa=कल्प|sa_rm=Kalpa}} that means "kalpa."
*** The term {{Lang|mini=1|zh=往世书|zh_rm=}} is a Sanskrit loanword meaning "Purana"{{Lang|sa=पुराण|sa_rm=purāṇa}}
* Sumeru's local specialty wine is frigid snake wine.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moonfinger}}</ref>
* A bubble universe known as "Seed of Sumeru" also exists in ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', [[HoYoverse]]'s previous game.
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''Truth Amongst the Pages of Purana'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Sub floreis lumen sagacitatis''," meaning "Under the flowery light of sagacity."
** One of the Sumeru NPCs, [[Anisa]], in the "Solitary Sea-Beast" mentions that she is training to be a Dastur. A {{w|dastur}} is a high priest(ess) in Zoroastrianism.<ref>Encyclopaedia Iranica: [https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dastur Dastur]</ref>
** Similarly mentioned in the Windblume festival by the NPC Sahid, Lesser Lord Kusanali is the provider of the Anahitian Blessing, Anahita (Anāhīd) was a water goddess in Zoroastrianism.<ref>Encyclopaedia Iranica: [https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/anahid Anahid]</ref> The literal translation of Anahiti is "water goddess" in Persian, therefore Kusanali is a provider of the "water goddess' blessing."
