{{Stub|Add in-game mentions in Furnishings, quests, and descriptions, if they exist. Add video references, such as Teasers, Trailers, Collected Miscellany and also (potentially) all Web Event appearances, Comic/Shorts appearances. External media in which a character only briefly appears but doesn't actually have anything of substance in it (e.g., the majority of Character Shorts, cameos in other characters' Character Demos) should not be added.}}
