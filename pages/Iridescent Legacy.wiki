==Dialogue==
===Iridescent Legacy: Part I===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...These are the words of the sovereign ruler [[Aj Nimalaj Chuq'ab Hun]]...
:&nbsp;
:...[[Xbalanque]]'s forces have broken through the Skyfire Circlet...
:...No less than expected of the hero who leads humanity. Only a warrior of such prowess might earn the right to die at my feet...
:&nbsp;
:...Their grasp of [[Phlogiston]] is still no more refined than the [[vishap]]s, yet it is enough to counteract our power &mdash; given the right circumstances...
:&nbsp;
:...If [[Kukulkan|the traitor]] had not handed the knowledge of fire to another race... No, even without the power of Phlogiston...
:&nbsp;
:...He was right all along. The civilization we [[Dragon]]s created has stagnated for too long. The grasping hands of humanity have ascended the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|Sacred Mountain]] and infringed upon our domain, yet we did not sense their climb...
:&nbsp;
:...I too... How long has it been since I felt the thrill of combat with a warrior such as this...
:&nbsp;
:...Haha, such a glorious feeling, should unbridled joy! My esteemed king, I entreat you &mdash; bear witness...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Iridescent Legacy: Part II===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...These are the words of the sovereign ruler [[Aj Chojojik Kamikabal U'uk]]...
:&nbsp;
:...Ah, such a frightful foe these humans are. So weak as to be unable to withstand a single blow, and yet even as their skin sloughs off their corroding corpses, more of their kin rise up to take their places...
:&nbsp;
:...Do they feel no fear? Do they not tremble in the face of death? Does not pain afflict them? Nor despair consume their hearts?
:&nbsp;
:...Ah, my lungs are pierced, to breathe is agony... Hehe, these humans who would end me, did the bright light that fills their eyes once shine from ours?
:&nbsp;
:...Hah, indeed? [[Xiuhcoatl|My lord]], that was a time when we had yet to abandon our glory...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Iridescent Legacy: Part III===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...These are the words of the sovereign ruler [[Aj K'astajibal Cha'ama' Ho'o]]...
:&nbsp;
:...Thrice-damned wretched worms... I wish not to gaze upon such... crude misuse of [[Phlogiston]]... Such shameful barbarism!
:&nbsp;
:...Had my proposal not been rejected by the traitors... would you have...
:&nbsp;
:...Wretched... vile... ignorant worms, sing your songs of joy! Expend your final breaths wailing praise for this short-lived reprieve...
:&nbsp;
:...Soon, the Lord of Light and Heat will expunge you all in flame. While we... in the fire's embrace...
:&nbsp;
:...My king... Great and glorious [[Xiuhcoatl]], you alone must not...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Iridescent Legacy: Part IV===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...These are the words of the sovereign ruler [[Ix Roq'ratik'obala' Ka'alahun]]...
:&nbsp;
:...Fascinating... [[Xbalanque|This leader of humans]] is more interesting than I had expected...
:&nbsp;
:...He is not Dragonborn, yet he is no less powerful than the noblest among us... On the contrary, he is more powerful by far...
:&nbsp;
:...Who is advising him? Incomprehensible. If a mere mortal could truly possess the wisdom to see through my schemes, why then prostrate before another...
:&nbsp;
:...Have I exhausted the limits of my body and mind? Have my senses grown dull, blunted by the degradations imposed by rank and power... To have forgotten that humans, too...
:&nbsp;
:...[[Xiuhcoatl|My king]]... we &mdash; your kin &mdash; are enfeebled, decayed... Why has it taken me so long to see...
