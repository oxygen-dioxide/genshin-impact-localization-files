|description    = An iron rack on which the campfire is lit. Properly-dried [[Adhigama Wood]] is used to keep the fire burning brightly for a long time. "Only valor's flame shall never be extinguished."<br />Such is the proverb that circulates among mercenaries, and you can often find those with a romantic disposition reciting this line to others. Although frustration is inevitable in a warrior's journey, the sight of the flaming campfire can rekindle their will to fight.<br />Therefore, mercenary groups treat camping and fire-building as the top priority in campaigns.<br />Similarly, putting out hostile units' campfires is also an effective way to demoralize them, especially when it comes to particularly obdurate foes. Rumors have it that [[Dehya|a mercenary with long, black-and-golden hair]] once broken into her enemy's camp single-handedly and put out all their campfires. She thus vanquished her enemy, bringing the battle to an early end and avoiding unnecessary casualties.
