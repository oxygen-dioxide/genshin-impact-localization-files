'''''Kanra's Lovesickness''''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
#Give five [[Sakura Bloom]]s to [[Kanra]]

==Request Details==
Help Needed:<br>
I wonder why my love hasn't sent me a letter yet... He went to Kannazuka to join the army, and I haven't heard from him since.<br>
Is he still alive, or... No, I can't bear to think about that.<br>
Please, could someone collect {{Color|buzzword|5 Sakura Blooms}} for me?<br>
I hope that the Sacred Sakura can carry my wishes to the Great Narukami and that she will protect him.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Narukami Island's Kara {{sic}} would like to have 5 Sakura Blooms.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kanra:''' *sigh* He should be alright, right...?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Searching for Sakura Blooms?
::'''Kanra:''' You saw my commission? Have you managed to get 5 Sakura Blooms?
::{{DIcon|Quest}} Here they are.
:::'''Kanra:''' Thank you. You know, since the man I love left to join the war, I've not heard one shred of news...
:::'''Kanra:''' These days, I worry about him at every waking moment. Only the sight of the Sacred Sakura's blossoms can soothe my mind a little.
:::'''Kanra:''' The reason is that before he left, he swore on the Sacred Sakura that he would return safely to me.
::{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:::'''Kanra:''' Okay. Well, you know where to find me when you've got them.
:{{Dialogue End}}
