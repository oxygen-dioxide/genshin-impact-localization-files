==Request Details==
{{Quest Description|Clockwork meka are causing trouble...}}

===Request from Liath===
"Tales of Humanity":<br><!--
-->Generally speaking, the State Hall has its own set of rules for recovering faulty clockwork meka.<br><!--
-->However, clockwork meka are simply too prevalent, so it's extremely difficult to stop some from slipping through the net and causing trouble outside the city.<br><!--
-->To all citizens who may happen to encounter such malfunctioning {{color|buzzword|clockwork meka}} &mdash; provided that you are able to do so without putting yourselves in danger, please help us nullify the threat that they pose.

===Request from Arouet===
"Tales of Humanity":<br>
To the Gardes:<br>
Why are lone {{color|buzzword|clockwork meka}} allowed to roam freely outside the Court of Fontaine? Why haven't the Gardes done anything about this when it's clearly such a threat to public security?<br>
Is there a conspiracy behind this, some kind of sinister backstage dealings? Who are the ringleaders? And who are the ones responsible for letting negligent Meka workers off the hook?<br>
We need a true hero of the people to stand forward and guarantee the security of the Court of Fontaine!

===Request from Chatelet===
"Tales of Humanity":<br>
To the guy shooting accusations left, right, and center about the Gardes in the last issue:<br>
The Gardes are extremely short on manpower. They're run off their feet as it is, let alone if they had to organize some plot.<br>
If I were you, I'd worry about more pressing concerns — like the fact your shop's coffee is a bit weak. Did you switch to cheaper coffee beans?<br>
Anyway, is there anyone out there willing to give the Gardes a hand? Sort out the {{color|buzzword|clockwork meka}} that have deviated from their assigned patrol routes in the countryside, you would sure save our resident coffee shop-owning conspiracy theorist a lot of worry.

===Request from Augereau===
"Tales of Humanity":<br>
We have received reports that certain clockwork meka have departed from their regular patrol routes and been found outside the city.<br>
The Gardes would like to thank citizens for bringing this issue to our attention. We are currently redoubling efforts to divert resources into recovering these {{color|buzzword|clockwork meka}}.<br>
It has also been reported that certain conscientious citizens have been helping us deal with these faulty Meka behind the scenes. We are extremely grateful to such high-spirited individuals.<br>
Your contributions help us make Fontaine a better place for all.
