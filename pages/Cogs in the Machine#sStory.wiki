:'''[[Wriothesley]]:''' I have to hand over the Mechanical Component price List in a few days. Time to head over to the production zone for a quick checkup.

;(Approach Snack Seeker)
:'''Snack Seeker:''' Wonder what I'll be eating at the [[Coupon Cafeteria]] later...

;(Inspect a non-suspicious spot, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Nothing untoward here.

;(Inspect face, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Is that... food on his face?

;(Inspect cart)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Is this hunger, or greed?
:'''Snack Seeker:''' Y&mdash;Your Grace! I&mdash;I just get a bit hungry as soon as I start working...
:'''Snack Seeker:''' Today's quota will be ready right away! Uh... How much do we each need to do per day again?
:'''Wriothesley:''' If this happens even when you're full, perhaps there's some kind of deeper psychological issue here.
:'''File Record:''' I promise I'll stop keeping so many secret snack stashes!

;(Approach Theater Lover)
:'''Theater Lover:''' 198, 199... Awesome! Already saved up this much!

;(Inspect a non-suspicious spot, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Nothing untoward here.

;(Inspect face, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Those are some serious eye bags. What on earth has she been doing in her downtime?

;(Inspect books)
:'''Wriothesley:''' What's this? Looks like someone's been saving up.
:'''Theater Lover:''' Ah, Your Grace! I, uh... got these [[Credit Coupons]] while watching the Tri-Coupon Troupe, certainly not by any other kind of dodgy dealings!
:'''Wriothesley:''' What's got you so nervous, I hadn't even asked. Could I see a detailed breakdown of the production data?
:'''Theater Lover:''' P&mdash;Production... Uh, we produce about this much per day... But, erm, we don't have any specific data reports as such...
:'''Wriothesley:''' That's a shame, I was under the impression you were good with numbers. I was actually considering promoting you, but I guess we'll have to forget about that.
:'''Theater Lover:''' Huh!? ...I&mdash;I'm so sorry, major oversight on my part...
:'''File Record:''' Next time, I'll wait till I'm off the clock before I start counting my Credit Coupons!

;(Approach Boxing Enthusiast)
:'''Boxing Enthusiast:''' Hehe, gonna be one against ten again tonight!

;(Inspect a non-suspicious spot, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Nothing untoward here.

;(Inspect face, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' That scar looks pretty new.

;(Inspect toolbox)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Boxing gloves? Why are these in the toolbox?
:'''Boxing Enthusiast:''' I&mdash;I was just getting my stuff ready, seeing as it's almost time to knock off...
:'''Wriothesley:''' Do you have somewhere to be?
:'''Boxing Enthusiast:''' I'm off to the [[Pankration Ring]] tonight to show what I'm made of! That's why I was getting ready early... But please rest assured, Your Grace, I haven't been slacking off!
:'''Wriothesley:''' That's alright. Either way, the data doesn't lie.
:'''File Record:''' I&mdash;I'll get back to work right away! Darn it, now that His Grace has his eye on me, i can't possibly leave early...

;(Approach Workshop Leader)
:'''Workshop Leader:''' This year, I'm certain to be No. 1...

;(Inspect a non-suspicious spot, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Nothing untoward here.

;(Inspect face, optional)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Someone's in a good mood.

;(Inspect the paper)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Is this the Price List?
:'''Workshop Leader:''' Ah! Your Grace, what brings you here?
:'''Wriothesley:''' Just passing by. According to the figures you've submitted, your daily output seems to be much higher than everyone else's... I trust you're coping?
:'''Workshop Leader:''' Uh... Erm... Just a little personal target of mine! Your Grace can rest assured, I've been pushing everyone to their limits! And if you factor in our professional assembly line setup too, I think you'll find there's absolutely nothing to worry about.
:'''Wriothesley:''' Then good luck in meeting your little target! Oh, and remember to give the Management Regulations a quick read too &mdash; especially the section on falsifying data.
:'''File Record:''' It's over, it's all over for me now...

;(Approach [[Aeife]])
:'''Aeife:''' Your Grace, it's been a while! Monsieur [[Neuvillette]] is currently presiding over a trial. I'd imagine it'll be quite a while before he returns... Is there anything you can leave with me? I'll pass it on for you later.
:'''Wriothesley:''' I'm just here to drop off a file actually. Much obliged, I'll leave it to you then, Ms. Aeife.
:'''Question:''' The file Aeife needs to pass on is:
:{{DIcon}} A: Letter of Resignation
::'''Wriothesley:''' That's not right.
:;(Return to choices)
:{{DIcon}} B: Production Volume and Price List
::'''Wriothesley:''' If anything else requires confirmation, feel free to contact me anytime.
:{{DIcon}} C: Tri-Coupon Troupe Ticket
::'''Wriothesley:''' That's not right.
:;(Return to choices)

----
;(Select Wriothesley)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Some people are like components, you just have to keep tapping away...

;(Select Wriothesley again)
:'''Wriothesley:''' There's a time and place for fun and games, and it's not when you're on the job.

;(Select Wriothesley again)
:'''Wriothesley:''' You have to keep an eye on them.

;(Select Wriothesley again)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Dripping again... Shouldn't affect production though.

;(Select Wriothesley again)
:'''Wriothesley:''' Once I'm done here it'll be time for afternoon tea.
