{{Quest Description|[[Amber]] wishes to discuss the matter of how you've been using your [[Wind Glider]]...}}
{{dialogue start}}
;(Talking to Amber)
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Hey (Traveler)! I've been looking for you everywhere! How's that wind glider I gave you last time?
:{{DIcon}} Pretty good.
:{{DIcon}} I keep getting carried away and gliding too high.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Seems like it's really growing on you!
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' But then again, you don't have a gliding license, do you?
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A gliding license? Hmm... What's that?
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Isn't it obvious? You gotta have a gliding license to legally glide in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 paimon 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ablq001 1 paimon 02b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Oh... but (Traveler) and Paimon have been gliding for ages now. This is the first we've heard about it!
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yeah, you've been gliding all over the place... Everyone's noticed!
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh-he.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sooo... You came looking for us because you wanna give us a gliding license?
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' No way! The Knights of Favonius have strict rules.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You need to pass an exam, and only then will the Knights issue your license.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Today I'm here as an examiner, to oversee (Traveler)'s official gliding exam!
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 09.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I gave you your wind glider, so this is my responsibility &mdash; at least, that's what Acting Grand Master Jean would say.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An exam! What a pain in the butt. Then again, since Amber is the examiner...
:{{DIcon}} ...Maybe you can cut me some slack?
::{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 10.ogg}} '''Amber:''' No with a capital N-O! Do not challenge the authority of examiner Amber!
:{{DIcon}} It's fine. I can do this.
::{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 11.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I'm sure (Traveler) will glide through it!
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 12.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I mean... The whole city saw how well you flew the day that Stormterror attacked, so I'm sure you'll have no problems!
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 13.ogg}} '''Amber:''' But we do need to respect the rules and glide properly.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 14.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Here. Take this gliding manual. No need to memorize it, just be familiar with everything in there.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 15.ogg}} '''Amber:''' For example: only one person per wind glider, no carrying anything over the set weight limit, no taking off using an Anemo Slime, and so on and so forth.
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 16.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Anyway, be sure to read it, okay? I had to read a load of big, thick books too when Lisa was teaching me magic...
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's a big old book... Paimon thinks we best get started!
:{{A|vo ablq001 1 ambor 17.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Great. Come find me when you're done, I'll be at Windrise.
:{{A|vo ablq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* The Knights of Favonius gliding manual does NOT sound like a fun read...
:{{DIcon}} Well, guess I'd better get started.

:{{Color|menu|You open the instruction manual expecting it to be a tedious chore, but to your surprise, you are met with a charming tale about baby birds learning to fly...}}
:'''''After Amber leaves, you begin to read the Gliding Instruction Manual with Paimon:'''''
::When the first wisp of wind brushed across the land
::Birds that yearned for the sky had wings
::But no way to fly
::They asked the Anemo God:
::"How can we reach the heavens?"
::To which the Anemo God replied:
::"You have yet to find that which is most important"
::As the God spoke, the wind thrust the seeds of a dandelion
::High into the sky
::The birds thrust out their wings
::But the breeze was all too mild
::Leaving them to stumble across the earth
::So they went to the gorge
::Where the wind showed off its wild and incomparable strength
::They threw themselves off the cliff
::And flapped their wings amongst the howling winds
::Until they were able to fly freely in the sky
::To the Anemo God they went, to gleefully say:
::"We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly"
::In reply the Anemo God said:
::"What you lacked was not wind, but courage"
::"It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world"
:{{A|vo ablq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... That's a cool story... But is the Knights' gliding manual really written in that style?
:{{DIcon}} It reads like a fairytale...
:{{DIcon}} People in Mondstadt really understand the romance in learning to glide.
:{{A|vo ablq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Anyway, let's go find Amber.
