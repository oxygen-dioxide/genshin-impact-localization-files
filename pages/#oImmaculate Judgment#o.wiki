|description    = A magnificent and glorious fountain modeled the same style as the immense fountain in the square in front of the [[Opera Epiclese]]. It has a total of four tiers, and each level is adorned with beautiful metallic decorations.<br>It is said that the designer compared the dazzling water glistening beneath the sunlight to the kind and elegant citizens of [[Fontaine]], while each of the important institutions of Fontaine are embodied by the majestic beasts seated on the sides of the fountain. They remain ever-vigilant to pass judgment and expel both stains and sin from this immaculate and pure country.
