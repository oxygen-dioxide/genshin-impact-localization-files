{{Quest Description|After a period of investigation, the Adventurers' Guild has eliminated the possible threats that the Specter incident may have caused, and they have also collected a lot of related information. This information has already been handed over to professional researchers, and it seems likely that they will soon make some further progress.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Katheryne:''' Thanks for your efforts thus far, Adventurer. We have been able to gather sufficient data concerning these Specters.
:{{DIcon}} Glad I could help.
::'''Katheryne:''' Mm-hmm. The observational reports you gathered were very important indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Some extra rewards would make for a nice thank-you.
::'''Katheryne:''' Haha, no problem. In that case, be sure to take part in future commissions as well.
:'''Katheryne:''' I believe that you need not worry about Specters threatening the ordinary people going forward. I will organize the intelligence we've gathered and submit them to professional researchers for study.
:'''Katheryne:''' Ah, and yes, please don't forget to claim your rewards from the Guild!
