{{Quote|The gods goad us on with the promise of their seven treasures. Rewards for [[Allogenes|the worthy]]. The [[Celestia|doorway to divinity]].<ref group="Note">The [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1At4y1q7UQ original Chinese text] can be roughly translated as {{Lang|''The gods have plated the outlines of desire with seven types of radiance. Through this, they have given hope for reaching their authority.''|zh=众神为欲望的轮廓镀上七种光辉。以此昭示，他们的权柄可被企及。}} It is clearly referring to Visions, which correspond to the seven elements and are granted in response to powerful desires, rather than a literal set of seven items.</ref>|[[Dainsleif]]|Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail}}
A '''Vision''' is a gift bestowed upon those who dwell in [[Teyvat]] and are recognized by the [[gods]]. It grants the user [[element]]al abilities based on the element of their given Vision. It is said that those with Visions have a chance of ascending to [[Celestia]] and attaining godhood themselves. Wielders of Visions are called [[allogenes]], though this is not a widely known term.

Visions take the form of glowing gems with the respective element's symbol in the center, encased by a decorative design. Allogenes carry their Visions on their persons.

In the upper left corner of the character screen, there is an icon that represents a playable character's Vision, with their element denoted by the gem and their in-game nation denoted by the [[#Appearance|decorative design]] around the gem, even for the characters that do not use Visions and characters with non-standard Vision designs.

==Overview==
Very little is known about Visions, even to those who have been bestowed with one as well as those who research Visions.

The one thing that is known for certain is that Visions are conduits for their associated elements. However, the means by which Visions allow their wielders to harness elemental energy, as well as what is exchanged for this power, are a mystery.

The way their powers manifest also vary based on the user's skills and personality. For example, while many Vision wielders can create independent entities in the forms of animals or humans, [[Fischl]] is the only one currently known to have created an apparently independent familiar ([[Oz]]) through her Vision,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Fischl|More About Fischl: IV}}</ref> and she seems to have subconsciously manifested him based on the character in [[Flowers for Princess Fischl]], her favorite novel series.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Fischl|3}}</ref>

Visions can resonate under certain circumstances, such as when reacting to elemental energy in the vicinity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Unknown Star}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Bygones Times Like Dust Passing}}</ref> A resonating Vision will flash, with the color depending on why the Vision is resonating. However, what the flashing and the different colors mean is unknown.<ref group="Note">Jean notes that her Vision resonates during Chapter 5 of the [[manga]], and dandelion seeds appeared near her Vision. It's not clear why her Vision was resonating or what it was resonating with, but at the time, [[Collei]], who had the remains of a god inside her and had not yet undergone the sealing process, had fallen asleep near Jean.</ref>

The [[#Appearance|casing with decorative designs]] around Visions as well as the shape of Visions are both region-based. Visions appear with the gem already shaped and the casing already around the gem, as seen when [[Rana]] and the [[Wanderer]] received their Visions, although the player only sees Wanderer's Vision when it appears.<ref name="rana vision" /><ref name="scara vision">{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref> Visions can have [[#Customized_Visions|accessories attached]], but whether the original casing can be modified is unknown. The only character with clearly nonstandard casing is [[Kaeya]], whose Vision casing has two wings on each side at the bottom instead of the standard three.

A Vision mounted sideways may still have the orb upright. Visions project their elemental symbol when the [[Elemental Burst]] is ready vertically regardless of the actual orientation.

As far as people know, Visions cannot be destroyed.<ref name="Keqing">{{Ref/CS|Keqing|Vision}}</ref> After a Vision wielder's passing, their Vision will [[#Masterless Visions|deactivate]],<ref name="Ningguang">{{Ref/CS|Ningguang|Vision}}</ref> losing its color and rendering it unusable unless it is reactivated. There are no known cases of Vision wielders who have more than one Vision, although they may temporarily reactivate a Masterless Vision and use it alongside their own Vision under certain circumstances.<ref name="the omnipresent god quest">{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God}}</ref> It is unlikely that anyone has permanently activated two Visions, as people find the idea of someone wielding two elements at once bizarre; [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] was subjected to malicious rumors that he used a [[Delusion]] due to his use of the Masterless Vision that he briefly reawakened.<ref name="kazuha story quest 1" />

===About Vision Granters===
Visions are given as a form of acknowledgement by Celestia,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Vision}}</ref> but it is unclear how Visions are created or activated. This is by design, as there are restrictions on what the Archons can say about the distribution of Visions.<ref name="ei vision dialogue">{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About the Vision}}</ref> The Archons do not have direct control over the distribution of Visions; instead, "the key is people's desire" and another unknown aspect.<ref name="ei vision dialogue" />
<!-- the lists below are not intended to be exhaustive -->
As the people of Teyvat are not aware of how Visions are distributed, there are varying beliefs about where Visions come from. Some allogenes attribute their Visions specifically to their nation's Archon even if the elements do not match,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Keqing|About the Vision: Reflection}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Klee|About the Vision}}</ref> others attribute their Visions specifically to their element's Archon even if they are from a different nation,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Faruzan|About the Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Yaoyao|About the Vision}}</ref><ref group="Note">Based on Yaoyao's voice-over, it seems that Yaoyao concluded on her own that her Vision is from the Dendro Archon, as despite being told that the "gods" grant Visions, Yaoyao singles out one god and wants to ask what "she" thinks of Yaoyao. This god is clearly not [[Rex Lapis]], Liyue's Archon. The only other god whose perceived involvement would make sense is [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], the Dendro Archon.</ref> and still others refer to their Visions as something granted by the Archons<ref>{{Ref/VO|Amber|About the Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiangling|About the Vision}}</ref> or even the gods<ref>{{Ref/VO|Bennett|About the Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Xinyan|About the Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Yoimiya|Vision}}</ref> in general.

After the Raiden Shogun enacted the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] a year prior to the events of the game, new Electro Visions stopped appearing, leading scholars at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] to conduct research and eventually conclude that the [[Archon]]s' wills determine the distribution of new Visions.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> Similarly, when [[Kazuha]] discusses the Vision Hunt Decree with the Traveler, he postulates that "each of the Seven Archons had their criteria for granting Visions to living beings" and that in the context of the Vision Hunt Decree, this would imply that the Raiden Shogun doubts the aforementioned criteria or even the act of giving Visions.<ref name="crux clash quest" /> However when asked directly, Ei is surprised that Electro Visions stopped appearing and says the Archons have no control over them. Whether that means the Akademiya and Kazuha's hypotheses are wrong, or that the Archons are simply not informed of the role they play, is unknown. The true reason behind the apparent lack of new Electro Visions throughout Teyvat during the Vision Hunt Decree is also unknown. It is also not known how often new Visions generally appear.

===Receiving a Vision===
When a person becomes worthy of a Vision, there are two ways they can receive it: A new Vision appears before them<ref name="kaeyavision">{{Ref/CS|Kaeya|Vision}}</ref><ref name="lisavision">{{Ref/CS|Lisa|Vision}}</ref><ref name="rana vision">{{Ref/Quest|"Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye"}}</ref><ref name="scara vision" /> or somewhere where they can find it,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kamisato Ayato|Vision}}</ref><ref name="shinobu vision" /><ref>{{Ref/CS|Tighnari|Vision}}</ref> or a nearby [[#Masterless Vision|Masterless Vision]] reactivates.<ref name="Ningguang" /><ref name="Mona">{{Ref/CS|Mona|Vision}}</ref>

Visions have been received in many different situations, ranging from near-death experiences<ref>{{Ref/CS|Bennett|Vision}}</ref><ref name="shenhe vision story">{{Ref/CS|Shenhe|Vision}}</ref> to the mundane.<ref name="lisavision" /><ref>{{Ref/CS|Albedo|Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Sucrose|Vision}}</ref> There is no known concrete way to receive a Vision or to reawaken a [[#Masterless Visions|Masterless Vision]], and even those who fight for their lives may not receive a Vision.<ref name="follow the wind" />

There is a saying that "when a person's ambition reaches a certain strength, the gods look upon them with favor"<ref name="three wishes" /> or that "when one's fervent ambition burns brightly, the gods will cast their gaze upon you,"<ref name="the omnipresent god quest" /> upon which a Vision appears, making Visions representations of their bearers' ambitions. The Traveler learns of this when they hear voices upon touching the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]]<ref name="three wishes">{{Ref/Quest|Three Wishes}}</ref> and meet certain people who [[#Losing a Vision|lost their Visions]], and they later utilize this knowledge with Yae Miko's help to defeat the Electro Archon in the [[Plane of Euthymia]].<ref name="the omnipresent god quest" />

Visions are received at various ages.
* [[Shenhe]] received her Vision at age 6.<ref name="shenhe vision story" /><ref>{{Ref/CS|Shenhe|3}}</ref>
* [[Klee]], who is effectively still a child, received her Vision at "a very young age".<ref>{{Ref/CS|Klee|Vision}}</ref>
* [[Qiqi]] also received her Vision when extremely young, as she received it during her final moments when she was still a child, before being saved.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|Vision}}</ref>
* [[Yaoyao]] is still a young child in the process of learning, and she has a Vision.
* [[Diluc]] received his Vision at age 10,<ref name="CHAP2">{{Ref/Manga|2|2}}</ref> allegedly an exceptionally young age.
* [[Hu Tao]] received her Vision at age 13.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Hu Tao|Vision}}</ref>
* [[Fischl]] received hers after she turned 14.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Fischl|Vision}}</ref>
* [[Kaeya]], who is around Diluc's age,<ref group="Note">During [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] Act III, [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait#Diluc|Diluc has dialogue]] that indicates he knew Kaeya when Kaeya was a kid. Based on a combination of the manga and his in-game stories, Diluc lost his father on his 18th birthday 4 years ago, which makes him about 22 years old now, the age of a young adult. Kaeya is currently old enough to drink. Therefore, Kaeya is a young adult around Diluc's age; if Kaeya were significantly older, then Diluc would not have seen Kaeya as a kid, and if Kaeya were significantly younger, then he likely would not yet be of drinking age.</ref> received his Vision the night of Diluc's 18th birthday a few years before the events of the main story.<ref name="kaeyavision" /><ref group="Note">Manga, Chapter 7: Dusty Chest [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/553?mute=1 (Part 1)] and [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/562?mute=1 (Part 2)] cover the day of Crepus's death, which was on Diluc's coming-of-age birthday. An earlier chapter of the manga (Chapter 2?) specifies that Diluc was 18 when Crepus was killed.</ref>
* [[Ganyu]], a half-[[qilin]] [[adeptus]] who is currently at least 3000 years old, received her Vision when she was at least 1000 years old.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|Vision}}</ref>

While there are no confirmed official ages in present-day for any of the characters, some of the playable characters are children or the equivalent of children, and many playable characters appear to be teenagers or young adults. Therefore, the playable characters who are mortal humans received their Visions while they were relatively young. It seems likely that it is common for allogenes to have received their Visions as teenagers or young adults, as young kids hope for Visions once they "grow up"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Journey to Liyue}}</ref> and adults may eventually decide that they will never receive a Vision.<ref name="crux clash quest">{{Ref/Quest|The Crux Clash (Quest)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Madame Qin}}</ref>

It is unknown if any ordinary mortal human has received a Vision as an infant or as an older adult or if either situation is even possible.

===Losing a Vision===
{{Quote|... to be stripped of one's Vision is to be stripped of one's ambition.|[[Yae Miko]]|[[A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades]]}}
Some of those who no longer use their Vision, whether they willingly or unwillingly gave it up, quite literally lost the ambition or goal that previously drove them and, in some cases, even lost critical memories.<ref name="tejima quest">{{Ref/Quest|The Meaning of Meaningless Waiting}}</ref><ref name="kyounosuke quest">{{Ref/Quest|To Treat the Well-Meaning Well}}</ref><ref name="domon quest">{{Ref/Quest|A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades}}</ref><ref name="nobumori">{{Ref/NPC|Nobumori}}</ref><ref name="bantan sango case file">{{Ref/Quest|Bantan Sango Case File: The Right Identity}}</ref> Those who lost a Vision and then regained it later also regained their previous ambitions or drive in general,<ref name="itto vision reclaimed">{{Ref/BB|Ritou Harbor Bulletin Board|Arataki Itto vs. Kujou Tengu II}}</ref> although more muted than before in some cases.<ref name="tejima npc">{{Ref/NPC|Tejima|c=after completing Omnipresence Over Mortals|s=3}}</ref>
<ref name="kyounosuke npc">{{Ref/NPC|Kurosawa Kyounosuke|c=after completing Omnipresence Over Mortals|s=3}}</ref><ref name="domon npc">{{Ref/NPC|Domon|c=after completing A Swordmaster's Path Is Paved With Broken Blades|s=3}}</ref> It is possible that rather than being symbols of ambition, Visions literally '''are''' that ambition in physical form.

The effects of losing or giving up a Vision are not the same for everyone. It is possible that these effects depend on how prepared or willing someone is to give up their Vision, but even then, the effects vary. It is also unclear how closely linked the effects are to the apparent reasons that people received their Visions.

[[Tejima]], [[Kurosawa Kyounosuke]], and [[Domon]] all suffered from losing their Visions to the Vision Hunt Decree, but Tejima and Kurosawa Kyounosuke lost certain memories that defined their actions in the past while Domon instead hallucinated the people he defeated until he spoke with [[Anzai]].

[[Iwakura Mitsunari]] surrendered his Vision to the Shogun and seemed to be in very low spirits, and he forgot the key to the secret blade technique he once taught,<ref group="Note">Iwakura Mitsunari both stopped teaching and lost his Vision after the Vision Hunt Decree was declared. It is not known which happened first, so it is unclear if Iwakura Mitsunari underwent memory loss in a similar manner as Tejima and Kurosawa Kyounosuke or if he simply forgot naturally over time. However, the key to a secret blade technique is likely an important memory, especially to an instructor who was formerly a skilled student. It is therefore possible that the memory was unnaturally lost with the seizure of Iwakura Mitsunari's Vision rather than a naturally occurring loss in the year since the Vision Hunt Decree was declared.</ref> but he does not appear to be experiencing anything on the scale of what Tejima, Kurosawa Kyounosuke, or Domon experienced. In addition, he says that despite forgetting the key to his technique and losing his Vision, he is willing to fight the Traveler to avenge his former students and "still [has] some of that fire" in him.

In contrast to all of them, [[Arataki Itto]] appeared to be quite lively even after unhappily losing his Vision to Kujou Sara. It is also implied that [[Kuki Shinobu]] was unaffected by the loss of her [[Vision]].<ref name="shinobu vision" /> Additionally, many people who lost their Visions to the Vision Hunt Decree joined the [[Watatsumi Army]];<ref name="the omnipresent god quest" /><ref name="blooms in prison">{{Ref/Quest|A Flower Blooms in a Prison}}</ref> evidently, they still had the willpower to fight even after losing their Visions.

Meanwhile, [[Nobumori]] appears to enjoy his new peaceful life without his Vision and says he felt as if he let go of "a heavy burden" when he handed his Vision over to Kamisato Ayato. [[Jiangxue]], who has exacted the justice he sought,<ref group="Note">It is not confirmed if this justice is related to the reason Jiangxue received a Vision, but it is likely due to the other narratives around giving up or losing a Vision as well as the emphasis placed on how Jiangxue is now at peace and no longer feels the need to use his Vision.</ref> is similarly enjoying a peaceful life without using his Vision and said that he is now "free of desire."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Dish Beyond Mortal Ken}}</ref> [[Diluc]], whose "hopes and dreams" died while he had his Vision,<ref name="diluc vision story">{{Ref/CS|Diluc|Vision}}</ref> discarded his Vision for a few years, during which he ravaged many Fatui strongholds using a [[Delusion]] instead;<ref name="diluc story 4">{{Ref/CS|Diluc|4}}</ref> when he returned to Mondstadt with his ambition restored, he began to use his Vision once again.

It is unknown what the maximum physical distance between a Vision and its owner is before the Vision cannot be used anymore, and it is also not known if significant physical barriers can prevent usage of Visions. However, Visions may at least light up in response to their masters' resolve if they are close enough.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God|archive=1}}</ref>

===Masterless Visions===
[[File:Unresonated Inazuma Vision.png|thumb|200px|<center>An unresonated Masterless Vision from Inazuma. Such Visions lack any elemental status and are unable to give specific elemental talents.</center>]]
After an allogene dies, their Vision deactivates, losing its color and becomes an empty husk without a trace of elemental power.<ref name="Ningguang" /><ref name="Path">{{Ref/Quest|A Path Through the Storm}}</ref> Such Visions are known as '''Masterless Visions''' and have a low probability of resonating with another person. Due to the history behind Visions, Masterless Visions are seen as a commodity.

The [[#Appearance|decorative design]] around a Masterless Vision is retained.<ref name="Path" /> It is unknown if the decorative design changes or can be changed after a Masterless Vision is reawakened.

There may be a belief that it is easier, or at least possibly easier, to reawaken a Masterless Vision than to obtain a new one. After taking [[Kazuha's Friend|his dead friend]]'s Vision, [[Kazuha]] deliberately tried to have others reawaken it. When the Masterless Vision was in the hands of [[Fei the Flyer]] for a brief period of time, Kazuha threatened him with mutilation and near-death to try to get the unknowing Fei to reawaken the Vision, but to no avail. Kazuha also offers the Masterless Vision to the Traveler to see if the Traveler can reawaken it.<ref name="follow the wind">{{Ref/Quest|Follow the Wind}}</ref> While many people want to obtain a Masterless Vision, it is unknown if they share this belief.

Kazuha was successful in temporarily reawakening the Masterless Vision himself to counter the [[Musou no Hitotachi]] during a cutscene in the {{Quest|The Omnipresent God}}. The Masterless Vision lit up as an {{Electro}} Vision while players heard the disembodied voice of Kazuha's friend say, "There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow," which he previously said while alive.<ref name="follow the wind" /> While the Masterless Vision was active, Kazuha was able to use it along with his own Anemo Vision.<ref name="kazuha story quest 1">{{Ref/Quest|Upon the Plain, a Purple Shadow}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Upon the Plain, a Purple Shadow}}</ref><ref group="Note">During the cutscene in [[The Omnipresent God]], while the effects around Kazuha are primarily Electro, there are also Anemo-colored visible winds in Kazuha's initial dash as well as while countering the Musou no Hitotachi.</ref> After countering the Musou no Hitotachi and saving the Traveler, Kazuha was thrown back, and the still-crackling Electro Masterless Vision was dropped, losing its light only after both it and Kazuha landed on the ground. It is therefore suggested from the cutscene that the Masterless Vision was reactivated because Kazuha momentarily shared, resonated with, wished to realize, or was otherwise connected to his friend's ambition.

Characters who have reawakened a Masterless Vision include:
* [[Mona]]<ref name="Mona" />
* [[Ningguang]]<ref name="Ningguang" />
* [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] (temporarily, and in addition to his own {{Anemo}} Vision)<ref name="the omnipresent god quest" />
{{clr}}

===Counterfeit Visions===
"Counterfeit Visions" and other similar terms can refer to two different things:
* Items that look exactly like genuine Visions but cannot be used to wield the elements.<ref name="blooms in prison" /> These have been used by Vision bearers to deceive enforcers of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], and by [[Venti]] and [[Zhongli]] to disguise their ability to wield elemental powers without a Vision.
** Additionally, Venti has given his fake Vision the ability to transform into the "Der Frühling" lyre,<ref name="VentiVision">{{Ref/CS|Venti|Vision}}</ref> the only case of a fake Vision having additional utility other than deception.
* [[Delusions]],<ref name="diluc story 4" /> devices granted by the [[Tsaritsa]] to [[Fatui]] members that allow them to wield the elements without or in addition to a Vision.

===Wearing Visions===
Currently, with the exception of [[Diluc]] when wearing [[Red Dead of Night]],<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/OBzQlqcH4J8?t=1584 Version 2.8 Special Program]</ref> all known Vision users who do not use a generic NPC model as well as a few who do use generic NPC models openly display their Visions on their person, typically on their waist or their back, and sometimes attached to a personal belonging rather than an article of clothing.

Wearing a Vision openly is not required to channel its power, as Diluc can use his Pyro Vision in present day while wearing Red Dead of Night.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|All's Well That Ends Well (Quest)}}</ref> It is unknown if there are additional stipulations for using a Vision.

Notably, during ''[[A Flower Blooms in a Prison]]'', Yoimiya wore her Vision openly even after handing over a fake Vision when hers was previously to be seized under the [[Vision Hunt Decree]]; this was not simply a case of Yoimiya having an unchanged character model for the quest, as Paimon initially assumed Yoimiya didn't have a Vision but then immediately corrected herself upon noticing Yoimiya's Vision on her own. Yoimiya then told Paimon, "If you don't keep your voice down, I won't have one much longer!" In addition, when Yoimiya said she still has her own Vision thanks to Master Masakatsu, the camera zooms in on Yoimiya's Vision.

Yoimiya also wore her real Vision openly during the operation to rescue Master Masakatsu, as the camera view changed specifically to show her Vision flashing right before the fireworks went off in the Police Station. This means that Yoimiya was either openly wearing her real Vision from the start or initially wore another fake Vision but then swapped it out for her real Vision by the time she set off the fireworks in the Police Station.

It is unknown what the maximum physical distance between a Vision and its owner is before the Vision cannot be used anymore, and it is also not known if significant physical barriers can prevent usage of Visions.

==Known Vision Users==
Besides [[Traveler]], [[The Seven]], and possibly [[Dainsleif]],<ref group="Note">His character information card in Chinese says "Vision" in Chinese, followed by a bunch of undecipherable squiggles. In addition, Dainsleif has been seen wielding powers that do not readily match one of the seven [[elements]].</ref> all [[Playable Characters|playable]] and [[Upcoming Characters|upcoming]] characters use Visions or are most likely using Visions. Other known characters who have or had Visions include:

* [[Hanshirou]]
* [[Jiangxue]] (formerly, gave his Vision up)
* [[Nobumori]] (formerly, surrendered it to [[Kamisato Ayato]] after losing a duel)
* [[Rana]] ({{Dendro}})
* [[Fujiki]] ({{Cryo}}), [[Fukami]] ({{Electro}}), and (Unnamed) ({{Anemo}}) (500 years ago)<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell to the Past}}</ref>
* The [[Millelith]] soldier who set up [[The Millennial Mountains|a memorial with "treasure"]] in [[The Chasm]] (500 years ago)
* The disciple who set up the [[Mt. Aocang#Ruins Treasure|Mt. Aocang Ruins Treasure monuments]] (unknown time period)

===Lost to Vision Hunt Decree===
* [[Arataki Itto]] ({{Geo}})<ref name="CommercialStreet">{{Ref/BB|Inazuma Commercial Street Bulletin Board|Arataki "The Strongest" Itto}}</ref>
* [[Domon]]
* [[Iwakura Mitsunari]]
* [[Kazuha's friend]] ({{Electro}})
** While his Vision was stolen by Kazuha who then fled Inazuma and later placed the Vision upon his friend's grave, the Vision was supposed to be taken as a result of Kazuha's friend's loss against Kujou Sara in a duel before the throne under the Vision Hunt Decree.
* [[Kuki Shinobu]] ({{Electro}})<ref name="shinobu vision">{{Ref/CS|Kuki Shinobu|Vision}}</ref>
* [[Kurosawa Kyounosuke]]
* [[Tejima]]
* Various members of the [[Watatsumi Army]] (all elements)

Following the abolishment of the decree, the Visions were returned to or reclaimed by their rightful owners, provided that they were still alive and could be contacted.

===Possible Vision Users===
* [[Ingbert]]<ref group="Note">[[Ragged Records]] refers to someone as one of "the chosen"; this must be Ingbert, based on [[Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III]]. So far, those who are referred to as "chosen" are largely, if not exclusively, Vision bearers. In addition, elemental traces can be found with [[Elemental Sight]] between Ragged Records #1 and Ragged Records #2. Based on the content of those Ragged Records, the elemental traces must have been from the fight between Eberhart and Ingbert, so it is highly likely that at least one of them&mdash;probably Ingbert&mdash;could wield an element.</ref>
* [[Eberhart]]<ref group="Note">Eberhart is the author of the [[Ragged Records]]. The first Ragged Records indicates that Eberhart has [[Elemental Sight|elemental sensitivity]]. However, this is at odds with how Eberhart calls Ingbert one of "the chosen" as if Eberhart is not part of them. It is possible that Eberhart was only being poetic.</ref>

==Appearance==
{{See also|Vision/Gallery}}
Visions from the same region all share the same basic shape. As such, the main difference in appearance between Visions other than the elemental color and surrounding decorative design are usually personal touches added by the owner. For example, [[Venti]] has fluffy balls and feathers on strings hanging from his Vision, and he also has a large decorative wing affixed directly to the Vision gem on the left side of the Vision when facing the front of it.<!-- it really is attached directly to the green gem -->

Visions appear to vary in size; for example, [[Ganyu]]'s Cryo Vision appears very small, while [[Yanfei]]'s Pyro Vision appears very big, and [[Diluc]]'s Pyro Vision appears very small while [[Jean]]'s Anemo Vision and [[Kaeya]]'s Cryo Vision are much larger. Oddly, [[Lisa]]'s Electro Vision appears much bigger when she is wearing [[A Sobriquet Under Shade]] than when she is wearing [[Purple Rose]]; this may be an error, as other characters with multiple outfits do not have Visions of varying sizes.

The decorative designs around Visions as well as the shape of Visions are both region-based.

===Mondstadt===
[[File:Item Mondstadt Vision.png|200px|thumb|<center>Mondstadt's basic Vision shape<br /><small>'''Note''': Uses [[Venti]]'s Vision</small></center>]]
The typical [[Mondstadt]] Vision has an orb-shaped gem inlaid within a pair of tri-feathered wings, with a diamond-shaped tail on the bottom and five spikes at the top. On the back of the Vision, there may or may not be three wing-like decorations along the bottom on one side.

;Nonstandard Vision designs:<!-- do not add size differences -->
* [[Kaeya]]'s Vision has two feathers on each wing instead of the usual three.
* [[Venti]]'s "Vision" is an ordinary glass orb he uses to help hide his identity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref><ref name="VentiVision" /> It does not glow when in proximity to [[Starsplinter Iron]].
{{Clr}}

===Liyue===
[[File:Item_Liyue_Vision.png|200px|thumb|<center>Liyue's basic Vision shape<br /><small>'''Note''': Uses [[Zhongli]]'s Vision</small></center>]]
The typical [[Liyue]] Vision has a diamond-shaped Vision inlaid in an octagonal border. At the corners of the diamond are arrow accents. On the back of the Vision, the corners of the diamond have smaller diamonds instead of the arrows.

;Nonstandard Vision designs:<!-- do not add size differences -->
* [[Xiao]]'s Vision may not be a typical Vision, as Xiao is an adeptus and wears a Vision specifically because he takes on a human form.<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/180703 Developer Insight #4: Character Stories (I) - "Vigilant Yaksha" Xiao (Part I)]</ref>
* [[Xingqiu]]'s and [[Yaoyao]]'s Vision on their character models have the back side facing outward instead of inward. Xingqiu's card art is depicted with the front side of his Vision facing outward, as expected of a Liyue Vision in general.
* [[Zhongli]]'s "Vision" may not be a real Vision for reasons similar to why Venti's Vision is not a real Vision. It does not glow when in proximity to [[Starsplinter Iron]].
{{Clr}}

===Inazuma===
[[File:Item_Inazuma_Vision.png|200px|thumb|<center>Inazuma's basic Vision shape<br /><small>'''Note''': Uses [[Yae Miko]]'s Vision</small></center>]]
The typical [[Inazuma]] Vision has an orb-shaped gem inlaid within a thin border and additionally surrounded by a full-circle stylized bow with a stylized knot at the bottom and three solid circles along the top half of the circle, with the middle circle being the biggest of the three.

The design seems to be inspired by the real-life {{w|Raijin|Japanese thunder deity Raijin}}. The three solid circles spanning the top semicircle may symbolize the Taiko thunder drum scaffold surrounding Raijin, and the bow may be derived from the Celestial Cloth around his shoulders.
{{Clr}}

===Sumeru===
[[File:Item_Sumeru_Vision.png|200px|thumb|<center>Sumeru's basic Vision shape<br /><small>'''Note''': Uses [[Tighnari]]'s Vision</small></center>]]
[[Sumeru]] Visions are orbs with a border shaped mostly like a teardrop or a leaf with the point on top. At the bottom, the border has two points at the side pointing upwards and three points in the middle pointing downwards.
{{Clr}}

===Snezhnaya===
[[File:Item_Snezhnaya Fatui_Vision.png|200px|thumb|<center>Snezhnaya's Vision shape<br />(with Fatui insignia)<br /><small>'''Note''': Uses [[Tartaglia]]'s Vision but adapted to Cryo for demonstration purposes</small></center>]]
[[File:Item_Snezhnaya_Vision.png|200px|thumb|<center>Snezhnaya's Vision shape<br />(without Fatui insignia)<br /><small>'''Note''': Uses [[Tartaglia]]'s Vision but adapted to Cryo for demonstration purposes</small></center>]]
[[Snezhnaya]]n Visions take the form of an orb surrounded by angled protrusions jutting out the top, bottom, left, and right sides, roughly reminiscent of a military badge. [[Delusion]]s found in-game look the same as Snezhnayan Visions, with the exception of the elemental symbol on the orb being replaced by the Fatui emblem.

So far all Visions and Delusions from Snezhnaya have a gray decorative design (possibly aluminum or iron), in contrast to the golden or polished bronze color found on all known Visions from the other nations.

;Nonstandard Vision designs:<!-- do not add size differences -->
* [[Tartaglia]]'s Vision on his character model has the [[Hydro]] symbol rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from it's initial position so that it is displayed upright, due to wearing his Vision sideways.

===Other Vision Designs===
[[File:Item_Aloy_Vision.png|100px|thumb|<center>Aloy's Vision</center>]]
[[Aloy]], who does not belong to any of the seven nations, has a unique vision design. Her vision takes the form of a diamond star with round edges inlaid in a golden circular frame. In all gameplay, Aloy's Vision behaves normally. It is unknown if this Vision design canonically exists in the world of Teyvat, or if it is for collaboration purposes only.

==Abilities==
===Playable Characters===
[[File:VisionShine.png|thumb|Noelle's Vision giving off a Geo symbol-shaped glow]]
When switching to a character with a Vision object on their person, if their Elemental Burst is ready, their Vision will briefly give off an elemental symbol-shaped glow, and a specific sound effect corresponding to the character's element will play. Of the characters wearing outfits without Vision objects on their person, only the [[Raiden Shogun]] does not have the elemental symbol appear anywhere; the Traveler has it appear over their chest plate, [[Nahida]] has it appear on the leaf in her hair, and Diluc while wearing [[Red Dead of Night]] has it appear over the phoenix's eye on his chest.

While a character's Elemental Burst is ready, the gem's color also pulses; in the cases of characters without a Vision object, other objects on their person will pulse instead (Traveler's chest plate, Raiden Shogun's items with the Electro symbol, various parts of Nahida's outfit), with the exception of Diluc while wearing Red Dead of Night. Some characters, such as Keqing, Diluc, and Jean, also have additional gems on their person that seem ordinary but whose colors also pulse when their Elemental Bursts are ready. Out of these characters, only the gems found on Mona's and Rosaria's outfits do not match the color of their element.

When a character receives [[Energy]] from any source, their Vision object will light up. Energy particles and orbs in particular fly directly into the Vision or the object that gives off the elemental symbol.{{Verify|which of the three Electro symbol items for Raiden?}}

During the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event and the Archon Quest Interlude Chapter, Visions are used as indicators by glowing blue when near meteorites and yellow when near [[Starsplinter Iron]], regardless of element. Out of the characters who were playable during Unreconciled Stars, Venti was the only one with a Vision that did not glow. (Zhongli was released after Unreconciled Stars.) In the Archon Quest Interlude Chapter, neither Venti's nor Zhongli's false Vision glow in proximity to Starsplinter Iron.

====Talents====
{{hatnote|Further information: [[Talents]]}}
In-game, Visions grant their bearers 2-4 active abilities: an [[Elemental Skill]], a secondary Elemental Skill, and an [[Elemental Burst]]. Sometimes, a Vision will grant a character the ability to take on the form of their element while they sprint (see [[Mona]] and [[Ayaka]]). These vary by character, [[weapon]], [[Ascension|ascension phase]], and [[constellation]]. Some characters momentarily go invisible as part of their attacks, such as [[Keqing]], [[Lisa]], [[Hu Tao]], and [[Rosaria]]. These may be abilities that use their Visions, as these characters visually disappear and reappear with a flash of their element.

The Traveler and the Archons are the only characters that do not use Visions to resonate with an element. Venti and Zhongli have items on their person that look like Visions and behave like other characters' Visions in most gameplay. While the [[Raiden Shogun]] has three items bearing the Electro symbol on her clothing (one tied to her obi, one embedded on the pauldron on her left shoulder, and one affixed to a fan on her back), none of these appear in the shape of a standard Inazuman Vision. All three of her items glow faintly in a manner similar to a Vision or the Traveler's clothing when their Elemental Burst is available.

All fully charged [[Aimed Shot]]s from [[bow]] users (like [[Amber]]) and all attacks by [[catalyst]] users (like [[Lisa]]) are infused with their element. Some attacks that normally deal {{Color|Physical DMG}} can deal elemental damage instead if an [[Elemental Infusion]] or [[conversion]] occurs. All Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts that deal damage deal elemental damage. There are a few that deal significant amounts of {{Color|Physical DMG}}, but even they also deal elemental damage.

The Elemental Skill is activated by tapping the [[keybind]] for it (default on PC: E) or by tapping the skill on-screen. If the current character has a secondary Elemental Skill, or if the primary Elemental Skill has a duration, then the button can be held down.

The Elemental Burst is activated by tapping the keybind for it (default on PC: Q) or by tapping the colored skill on-screen. This will convert energy built up by the character to the element in question.

===Non-Playable Characters===
Some non-playable characters or non-playable versions of characters also have additional abilities beyond their talents as playable characters. For example, the [[Enter the Golden House|Golden House]] boss Childe has more abilities and attacks than the playable character. Diluc is seen with a wider range of Pyro abilities in [[Crash Course]], [[Legend of the Darknight Hero]], and [[Darknight Hero's Alibi (Quest)|Darknight Hero's Alibi]], including long-range Pyro attacks and blasting out of ice. Ningguang demonstrated the ability to teleport and activate a series of magical mechanisms of her [[Jade Chamber]] through the use of Geo seals in [[Turning Point]], as well as creating a multitude of magical portals around her entire floating palace from which numerous Geo elemental gems used to attack [[Beisht]] come out in [[Where the Heart Finds Rest]]. Shenhe has proven that she is capable of freezing an entire tsunami by drawing on all of her Cryo powers' energy during the same fight against Beisht. Zhongli is seen creating a far wider Jade Shield that lets him protect a number of characters from attacking miners in the [[No Mere Stone|Historia Antiqua Act II]] character quest. Mona is also shown to be capable of teleporting herself and people near her short to medium distances during her [[Astrolabos Chapter|Story Quest]] and the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event. In the [[manga]], Amber and Kaeya are shown with abilities that they do not have as playable characters, such as creating a Pyro shield and many Cryo constructs.

Yoimiya also remotely sets off fireworks with her Vision in the Police Station during [[A Flower Blooms in a Prison]]. [[Yanfei]] was seen creating a protective Pyro barrier around [[Kuki Shinobu]] and an exhausted Arataki Itto during [[End of the Line (Quest)]]. [[Yelan]] is also seen using her Vision to hide in her official [https://youtu.be/nEX4Umn5Bx8 character teaser].

==Trivia==
* The Traveler has witnessed two people receive a Vision: [[Rana]], during the {{Quest|"Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye"}}; and the [[Wanderer]], during the {{Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}.
* Visions are connected to constellations:
** Astrologers believe that the destinies of Vision-bearers can be found in [[Constellation|constellations]].<ref>{{Ref/VO|Mona|Something to Share}}</ref>
** Because Vision-bearers are matched to constellations, they are said to each have the power of a tiny cosmos in themselves. Liyue's thaumaturges call this "The Microcosmic Orbit" or the "Microcosmos."<ref>Event [[Hyakunin Ikki/2022-03-18|Hyakunin Ikki]] Challenge: [[Hyakunin Ikki/2022-03-18#Burn, My Microcosmos!|Burn, My Microcosmos!]]</ref>
*** This theory appears to be supported by the appearance of Ningguang's constellation, [[Opus Aequilibrium]], behind her when she invoked all her {{Geo}} power in the joint attack against Beisht.
* Vision bearers can use [[Portable Waypoint]]s.
* [[Monroe]] mentions a "God's Eye" in one of his voiced idle lines, which is the direct translation of the Chinese term for Visions.
* A nation's Vision shape can be seen on Character Cards, as the topmost icon containing the character's element.
* A "helix-shaped divine ladder" can allegedly be seen inside Visions, which are also witnessed by those who ascend to Celestia.<ref>[[Map]], Interactible: [[Spiral Abyss]]</ref> Such a phenomenon has not yet been shown in-game.
* In the [[Manga]], when [[Collei]] breaks out of the shield Amber surrounded her in as proof of her resolve to protect those she cares about, the Pyro symbol in Amber's Vision is replaced by a star-shaped symbol intertwined with a triangle. The symbol returns to normal shortly afterwards.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|15|note=Chinese}}</ref>
* It is still not yet understood how [[Hilichurls]], particularly the Samachurls, are able to manipulate the elements without a Vision.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Hilichurl Cultural Customs|1|Hilichurlian Social Structure}}</ref> Despite holding some degree of elemental manipulation, hilichurls are also stated to be unable to reside in places with high concentrations of elemental energy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hurdle}}</ref>
* From [[Version 1.1]] to [[Version 1.4|1.4]], the elemental symbol on Zhongli's Vision was rotated. However, this was a mistake and was fixed in [[Version 1.5]], dispelling the then-common theory that he had unintentionally created his fake Vision with its elemental symbol in an incorrect configuration.
* As Archons who are known to the public as such, the [[Raiden Shogun]] and [[Nahida]] do not have Visions, decoy or otherwise, as they have no need to hide the origins of their elemental powers.

===Etymology===
* The Chinese term for Vision, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=神之眼|zh_rm=Shén zhī Yǎn|zh_tl=Eye of God}}, is similar to the term for {{Lang|Gnosis|zh=神之心|zh_rm=Shén zhī Xīn|zh_tl=Heart of God}}. Both of them are called {{Lang|mini=1|zh=魔力器官|zh_tl=magical organs}}, which was translated as "magical foci" in English.
