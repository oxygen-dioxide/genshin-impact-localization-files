===An Ordinary Day for the Knights of Favonius===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to the voice behind the door of Klee's confinement room, optional)
:;(Klee's voice is, as usual, muffled behind the sturdy door.)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909504 klee 01.ogg}} '''Voice Behind the Door:''' When is Kaeya coming back? He still hasn't read me the 10th and 11th stories from The Fox in the Dandelion Sea...

;(Talk to Jean)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey, you two busy?
:{{DIcon}} Long time no see, everyone.
:{{DIcon}} I'm back, Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' You must have had a tough journey, Kaeya. Oh, it's been a while, cutie.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Yes, welcome back, Kaeya. Why is the Honorary Knight accompanying you?
:{{Black Screen|You explain your chance encounter with Kaeya in Sumeru to Jean and Lisa.}}
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Hmm, I understand. Back to matters at hand, Kaeya, I have already received your report. You did well this time, thank you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' A few days ago, we received a letter from the representative of the wine merchants' association in Sumeru. It was thanks to your on-the-spot decisions that further losses due to continued delays were avoided.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Just doing my duty &mdash; anything to reduce the Acting Grand Master's workload. Oh, I nearly forgot. I have some unused travel funds. I'll return the surplus now.
:{{DIcon}} (He's talking like he wasn't planning on spending it.)
:{{DIcon}} (I have a sudden urge to expose him...)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Given the suddenness of the situation, and the difficulty in resolving it, I authorized a greater than normal disbursement in case of unforeseen circumstances.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' But I didn't think there would be this much left over. Thank you, Kaeya.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Just doing the right thing. But I'm not actually here for a post-trip debrief. I brought some souvenirs back for everyone.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Souvenirs from Sumeru?
:[[File:Souvenirs from Sumeru.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Here... The letter opener is for Jean, the jeweled brooch is for Lisa, and the items in the box are for everyone else.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' This artistry of this is exquisite, look at the ornamentation on the sheath... This must be one of those crafts unique to Sumeru. It's my first time seeing one in person. Thank you, Kaeya.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I love the color of the gem in this brooch, and the setting is so elegant. You have excellent taste, Kaeya. This can't have come cheap?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It wasn't too bad. I didn't spend too much...
:;(A muffled voice comes through the office door.)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Might I intrude a moment?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Albedo, is that you? Come in.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I've finished the latest quarterly expenses report for the workshop. It's ready for your review. {{Traveler}}, greetings. And Kaeya, welcome back from Sumeru. Haven't seen you in a while.
:{{DIcon}} Hello, Albedo.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You two look like you're in good spirits.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' As a matter of fact, the Honorary Knight and I traveled back from Sumeru together. Ah yes, and I brought some souvenirs for you and Klee, they form a set... Hold on, let me dig them out...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You're too kind. Klee has been constantly inquiring as to the timing of your return lately.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Since you weren't around, she thought you had also been grounded, and that it would be a long time before you could come out.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Children always have the most peculiar way of looking at things, hehe.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ..."Also" been grounded? Sounds like things haven't been too dull for you all in my absence.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' It's Klee's third time this month.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Evidently, you're not the least bit surprised.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' No... On the contrary, what would be a surprise is if Klee ever managed to stay out of trouble for a substantial length of time.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Heh. Anyway, since my souvenir is part of a set with Klee's, there's no rush to give it to me.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' When Klee's next... well, released, I'll bring her to see you sometime. We'll collect our souvenirs together.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Sure, makes sense. Leave the surprise for the person who'll enjoy it the most.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I'll leave these documents here. I'll take my leave now, everyone.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Kaeya, I've approved your vacation request, use this time to relax and unwind. Don't worry about the report and other work, I'll take care of it.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 qin 11.ogg}} '''Jean:''' You too, Honorary Knight. There isn't any work the Knights of Favonius require your assistance with at this time, so please take it easy.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Thank you, then we'll be going now.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Enjoy your vacation. But don't forget to return [[The Fox in the Dandelion Sea]] series before it's due.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909502 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Don't worry, I'm nearly done with those. I'll be able to return them in a few days.

;(Talk to Jean, optional)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909504 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Though there's always something to do, with everyone lending a hand, I always feel at ease.

;(Talk to Lisa, optional)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909504 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Kaeya is just as thoughtful as always.

===Homecoming===
;(Outside the headquarters, it is sunset.)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I'm surprised Klee still hasn't escaped... I taught her a few tricks just before I left.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you smirking?
:{{DIcon}} This is just the norm to you?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Kids will always have their moments of mischief, but to be able to grow up without a worry or care in the world is something truly precious.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, now that all the gifts for the Knights of Favonius are with Jean, next up is...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh... how about we visit the [[Dawn Winery]] under the pretext of delivering souvenirs and try to score some free wine? It's been a long time since I last saw everyone there. Plus it'll be the perfect time to treat you to some of their newest brews.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' [[Diluc]] should be there tomorrow, since he has business to deal with. But then there's nothing scheduled for the day after tomorrow, so perhaps it'll be easier to get free wine then...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' What do you think? When should we go?
:{{Hangout Branch|Tomorrow.|Fragrance of Wine}}
::{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' That works, then I guess we'll see Diluc. Let's meet at the front entrance of the Dawn Winery tomorrow.
:{{Hangout Branch|The day after tomorrow.|Taste of Home}}
::{{A|vo kycop001 1909503 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Great, then it's settled. Let's meet the day after tomorrow at the front entrance of the Dawn Winery.
