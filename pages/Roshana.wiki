==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Roshana:''' Want a drink? Let the [[Eymen|bartender]] know.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Roshana:''' As you see, just a staff member.
::'''Roshana:''' Though I don't make cocktails or wait on customers.
::'''Roshana:''' After all, we have a bartender and [[Nesmil]] here. Nesmil could handle most of the work alone.
::'''Roshana:''' The bartender actually owns the place.
::'''Roshana:''' He doesn't want to offend customers, so he'll try to meet any of your demands.
::{{DIcon}} You dislike working here?
::'''Roshana:''' I don't actually like it, but I don't hate it either.
::'''Roshana:''' Overall, it's better than when I was with [[the Eremites]], because I don't have to deal with those stiff researchers anymore.
::'''Roshana:''' Ha, it's funny that even the power of alcohol is greater than knowledge.
::'''Roshana:''' Wait and see &mdash; a glass of something stronger is enough for those researchers to abandon rules.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Roshana:''' Yeah.
