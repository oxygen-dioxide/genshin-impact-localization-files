The Inazuma archipelago is sub-divided into three main factions: the islands ruled by the [[Raiden Shogun]] ([[Narukami Island]], [[Kannazuka]], [[Yashiori Island]], and [[Seirai Island]]), [[Watatsumi Island]] which worships [[Orobashi]], and [[Tsurumi Island]] which was destroyed by [[Kanna Kapatcir]] in the distant past and has largely been uninhabited since.

While these islands are all considered part of Inazuma, the geographical and cultural makeup of these areas are vastly different.

==Life in Inazuma==
Life in Inazuma prior to the [[Ei]]'s [[Vision Hunt Decree|Vision Hunt]] and [[Sakoku Decree]] is unknown, but [[Paimon]] states that Inazuma did not have any problems the year before she began accompanying the Traveler.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> After Ei issued her decrees, life in the country took a drastic turn for the worse for all, as available resources in the nation dropped and very few goods were imported in, forcing many businesses to look for alternate methods. Crime is particularly rampant in Inazuma's wilderness, with large numbers of [[Treasure Hoarders]] and ronin like [[Nobushi]] and [[Kairagi]].

[[Atsuko]], a native of Inazuma, stated that Inazuma has a very tense and dangerous atmosphere.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Atsuko}}</ref> [[Bibo]] likewise considers it to be very dangerous, claiming that while he can get anything at the right price, he refuses to get any Inazuman products.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Bibo}}</ref>

Following the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree and expulsion of corrupt officials, life began to slowly improve for the better, although the Sakoku Decree meant that the economy was still struggling. After Ei abolished the Sakoku Decree, life took a turn for the better as the nation is finally able to conduct general trade and an outpouring of foreign visitors.

[[Bake-Danuki]]s are known to live in Inazuma, who enjoy pranking passersby by pretending to offer food and shelter, disguising it as leaves and mud.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaedehara Kazuha|3}}</ref> While humans are still the most predominant inhabitants of Inazuma, youkai such as [[tengu]], [[oni]] and [[kitsune]] also reside in Inazuma; however, like the [[adepti]] of [[Liyue]], few remain and most live in seclusion.

Inazuman samurai society often revolves around an honor system of sorts; samurai families, being relatively common in Inazuma, have an immense amount of pride and honor, often sending their children to serve in the Shogun's armies to glory and fame. Samurai are known to engage in duels from time to time. They are particularly prideful of their own skills; being bested in battle or duel by another or being helped by an outsider is typically considered to be shameful.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dreams of Sword Art}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
Watatsumi Island has historically had very poor soil for growing crops, which was a primary motivating factor for the Narukami-Watatsumi War at the end of the [[Archon War]]. According to legend, [[Enkanomiya]] is constantly trying to pull the spirit of Watatsumi Island into the depths, causing soil erosion and bleaching that turns it into "Holy Soil." The [[Watatsumi Mitama Omatsuri]] is a ritual performed to stave off the spread of Holy Soil. [[Tsuyuko]], a shrine maiden who studied at Sumeru Akademiya, believes that "Holy Soil" is actually caused by the salinity and alkalinity of the seawater encroaching on the island, which leaches nutrients from the soil.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)}}</ref>

Other islands appear to be having a similar issue, as [[Konda Village]] of [[Narukami Island]] has difficulty in trying to grow crops.

Many [[Lavender Melon]] trees can be found across Inazuma's islands. While [[Sunsettia]] and [[Apple]] trees cannot be found in Inazuma's overworld, this seems to be a purely gameplay phenomenon: the [[Expedition]] reward for [[Byakko Plain]] includes Sunsettias, which indicates that Sunsettias can be found in Inazuma's wilds.

===Architecture===
Inazuman buildings and furnishings typically make use of [[Aralia Wood|Aralia]], [[Maple Wood|Maple]], [[Otogi Wood|Otogi]] or [[Yumemiru Wood]]. Yumemiru wood is typically used for creating shrines.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Category:Inazuma Dishes}}
According to [[Chongyun]], authentic Inazuman cuisine is ice-cold fresh and can take the exhaustion away from a day of hard training.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Chongyun|Favorite Food}}</ref> Seafood plays an important role in Inazuman cuisine, such as sushi and tempura. Other foods include poultry like [[Imported Poultry]], ramen, dango, and egg rolls.

===Technology===
The [[Maguu Kenki]] originate from Inazuma. They are magical autonomous puppets that use the powers of {{Cryo}} and {{Anemo}}, having been created by unknown people to mimic the [[Iwakura Clan]] sword arts.

Onmyoudou was also developed in Inazuma by [[Kamuna Harunosuke]]. While mostly forgotten, traces of it still exist in legends and by the [[Kairagi]], who utilise shikifuda to elementally infuse their swords despite not having a [[Vision]].

===Duels===
A Duel Before the Throne is a traditional Inazuman duel between two combatants that is fought in [[Tenshukaku]] and witnessed by the Shogun.

If someone has a disagreement with another party or feels that they have been slighted in some way, they can challenge the offender to a duel before the throne. The two parties will travel to Tenshukaku and present their case to the Raiden Shogun. If the Shogun gives them the clearance to engage in combat, then they will begin fighting until someone is unable to duel any further. These duels always end in the death of one of the combatants. The loser is either killed by a lethal blow, or if they survive the duel, executed by the [[Musou no Hitotachi]].

Two notable duels have been referenced so far. [[Kazuha's Friend]] challenged the Raiden Shogun to a duel for instituting the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], and [[Kujou Sara]] accepted on her behalf. He ultimately lost the duel and was executed. Later, during [[Duel Before the Throne]] in the [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]] Archon Quest, the [[Traveler]] challenged [[Signora]] to a duel in an attempt to stop the [[Fatui]] from taking over Inazuma and also as an act of revenge for her stealing [[Venti]]'s [[Gnosis]]. A hard battle was fought, and ultimately, Signora was defeated and executed by the Musou no Hitotachi.

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
{{See also|Symbols in Teyvat}}
The following designs, motifs, and symbols are typically seen within Inazuma or on Inazuma-related parties.

===Character Cards===
Inazuma's Character Cards are similar to [[Mondstadt/Culture#Character Cards|Mondstadt's]]: it features one large circle with a smaller circle inside, aligned towards the bottom of the larger circle. Inazuma's Vision shape takes up the top center of the space between the two circles, with five smaller circles on each side.

The bottom three circles' icons are largely the same: the bottommost depicts a sakura or cherry blossom, while the one above it depicts two different {{w|kumadori}} makeup styles used in {{w|Kabuki}} theater. Above that are two opposing animal envoys wearing their corresponding masks: A {{w|kitsune}} wearing a fox mask on the right side and an inugami wearing a dog mask on the left.

Of the remaining four circles, the bottom left one depicts coral and crashing waves, which is possible a reference to [[Orobashi]]. Above it is a {{w|Shinto shrine}} with a cherry blossom symbol above it. To the right of the Vision is an icon depicting the [[Tenshukaku]], and below it is an icon of a {{w|Tomoe|mitsudomoe}} with a katana.

==Economy==
Book printing appears to be one of the main trades in Inazuma, in part due to the [[Yae Publishing House]], who are known throughout Teyvat as the giant in the printing industry. They occasionally host the "This Novel is Amazing!" contest.

Prior to the Sakoku Decree, Inazuma frequently exported toys, fireworks and kimonos. After the Shogun issued the decree, only ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission could bring items in and out, resulting in less trade domestically and internationally. Even then, the fierce storms generated by the Shogun meant that few ships dared to brave them and many goods were lost in the process. Fishing also saw a decline as the Tenryou Commission saw boats of all sizes as escape vessels. After the Sakoku Decree was abolished, all of these are slowly returning to pre-decree levels.

Like Liyue, Inazuma also possesses a mining and smithing industry. [[Jakotsu Mine]] and the [[Mikage Furnace]] are well known in Inazuma, but the former closed after a "[[Tatarigami|sickness]]" spread throughout the island, while the latter closed after the core went critical, threatening to leak Tatarigami energy until it was fixed, but even then, many are still hesitant to return. Inazuman swords are particularly well known due to the use of Jade Steel, a special material from [[Tatarasuna]], although production has since halted following the peace treaty between Watatsumi and the Shogunate.

Women in Inazuma tend to have bangs. Younger women tend to have their hair cut in a short bob, whereas older women tend to have their hair tied up in a bun.

Elderly women's attire in Watatsumi Island have the same coloring as the attire in Narukami Island, except inverted. This is a possible parallel between Watatsumi Island's worship of [[Orobashi]] and Narukami Island's worship of the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]].

===Fisher's Attire===
<gallery hideaddbutton="true" captionalign="center">
NPC Kujirai Momiji.png|Fisherwoman ([[Kujirai Momiji]])

Fishers in Inazuma do not have special clothing compared to other NPCs, but they can typically be distinguished by the {{w|Kasa (hat)|''kasa'' hats}} they wear.

===Samurai's Attire===

The Nobushi can be primarily distinguished by their color palettes and their differences in ''kasa''. Jintouban wear a {{Lang|Nirayama-kasa|ja=韮山笠}}.

===Shogun's Army Uniform===
<gallery hideaddbutton="true" captionalign="center">
NPC Watanabe.png|Standard [[Shogun's Army]] Doushin attire ([[Watanabe]])
NPC Kobayashi.png|Standard Officer attire ([[Kobayashi]])
NPC Okawara Goemon.png|Standard Yoriki Samurai attire ([[Okawara Goemon]]) <!--note that yoriki seem to come in all shapes and sizes, from the npcs we have; enemy yoriki looked like this though-->
</gallery>

The attire of the standard rank-and-file of the Shogun's Army uniforms are modeled after the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} foot soldiers of feudal Japan. Their clothing cosists of a ''shitagi'' (shirt), ''kobakama'' (pants), whose colors varied, white socks and ''waraji'' sandals. Their eggplant-colored armor consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''kote'' (armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). Infantry only wear ''han-kote'' (half-kote), while officers' sleeves were fully armored. Sometimes personnel, usually officiers, may be seen wearing a {{Lang|''jingasa''|ja=陣笠}} with the crest of the Inazuma Shogunate. They are equipped with a ''juumonji yari'' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead. Higher-ranking officials, like the yoriki samurai, can be seen equipped with  ''sode'' (shoulder armor) on the left arm, wearing a ''kabuto'' (helmet), and are barefoot in their ''waraji''. Instead of using ''yari'', these samurai carried ''katanas'' at their hips on the left side with the blade facing down.

The coloration of the clothing and armor accents indicates the ranking of the individual within the Shogun's Army. Low-ranking infantry personnel could be identified by their purple-gray ''shitagi'', gray ''kobakama'', and gray accents on their armor. Officers also wore purple-gray ''shitagi'', but their lavender ''kobakama'' pale gold accents on the armor indicated their higher ranking. The yoriki samurai and higher officials (e.g. Hatamoto) were distinguished with their lavender ''shitagi'', indigo ''kobakama'', and dark gold accented armor.

===Watatsumi Army Uniform===
<gallery hideaddbutton="true" captionalign="center">
NPC Teppei.png|Standard [[Watatsumi Army]] samurai attire ([[Teppei]])
</gallery>

Compared to the Shogun's Army (which consist of 3 attires), the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform is available in one design, so rankings were more intuitive within the army. Watatsumi Army's clothings consists of light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. The [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'', ''han-kote'', ''haidate'', and ''sune-ate'' armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. The common weapon used among the ranks is the ''juumonji yari'', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

===Shrine Maiden's Attire===

NPC Maki.png|[[Grand Narukami Shrine]]'s shrine maiden attire ([[Maki]])

The standard shrine maiden uniform consists of a ''kosode'' and ''hakama'', white socks, and ''okobo'' sandals. Shrine maidens at the Grand Narukami Shrine of [[Narukami Island]] wear a red ''hakama'' and red accents on their outfit, while shrine maidens at the Sangonomiya Shrine and Mouun Shrine of [[Watatsumi Island]] wear a deep blue ''hakama'' and deep blue accents on their outfit.

==Festivals and Holidays==
===Summer Festival===
{{main|Summer Festival}}

==Languages==
{{Main|Inazuma Language}}

==Politics==
The Shogun is assisted by a group known as the [[Tri-Commission]] by its people; they act similarly to the collective of the [[Liyue Qixing]] and the [[Eight Trades]], with each commission handling different responsibilities.<ref name="A Path Through the Storm ">{{Ref/Quest|A Path Through the Storm}}</ref><ref group="Note">While the English text of [[Atsuko]] during ''[[A Path Through the Storm]]'' says it is roughly equivalent to "the Eight Trades '''under''' the Liyue Qixing" (emphasis added), both the Chinese and Japanese equivalents of the line simply say {{Lang|"Seven Stars (Qixing) and Eight Gates (Eight Trades)"|zh=七星八门|zh_rm=Qīxīng Bāmén}}. In Imperial China, "[number] + [upper office] + [number] + [lower office]" was a common expression to refer to a national administrative system as a whole (rather than specific offices), as in {{Lang|"{{w|Three Lords and Nine Ministers}}"|zh=三公九卿|zh_rm=Sāngōng Jiǔqīng}} and {{Lang|"{{w|Three Departments and Six Ministries}}"|zh=三省六部|zh_rm=Sānshěng Liùbù}}.</ref>

The Tri-Commission consists of three commissions; the [[Kanjou Commission|Kanjou]], [[Tenryou Commission|Tenryou]] and [[Yashiro Commission]]. Each one tends to their own duties and are led by a prestigious clan the [[Hiiragi Clan|Hiiragi]], [[Kujou Clan|Kujou]] and [[Kamisato Clan]] respectively.

The Kanjou Commission handles the nation's borders, checking documents of both foreigners and returning citizens. They were originally led by [[Hiiragi Shinsuke]], who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot.

The Tenryou Commission handles the nation's security from all internal and external threats. They were originally led by [[Kujou Takayuki]], who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot. Similarly to Shinsuke, an official successor has not been declared, although [[Kujou Sara]] currently fills the role.

The Yashiro Commission handles the management of shrines, festivals and cultural events, being the most connected to the people. They are currently led by [[Kamisato Ayato]]. Outside of this, Ayato is also responsible for handling corrupt officials and the [[Shuumatsuban]], a ninja organization that directly answers to him. The Shuumatsuban handle clandestine operations such as intelligence gathering and counter-ops.

Watatsumi Island is a unique outlier in that the island is mostly governed by the Divine Priestess of the [[Sangonomiya Clan]] due to the islanders' worship of [[Orobashi]] instead of Ei. The current Divine Priestess is [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]].

Prior to the Traveler's arrival in Inazuma, Ei had enacted both the Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree as she felt that they aligned with her ideals of eternity at the time. In reality, this was a Fatui plot intended to cause instability in the nation and market their [[Delusion]]s, convincing both Shinsuke and Takayuki to collude with them. Takayuki would feed the Shogun false information about the war while Shinsuke would provide the Fatui with [[Crystal Marrow]]. While the Kamisato siblings were suspicious of the unusual circumstances, their lack of influence and the potential consequences did not result in much activity. The resulting Vision Hunt Decree caused a civil war between the [[Watatsumi Army]] and the Shogunate.

When the Traveler arrived, they were able to discover the whole truth of the plot and with the assistance of [[Yae Miko]], convinced Ei to start listening to her people's wishes. After learning the full extent of the Fatui plot, she stripped both Shinsuke and Takayuki of their positions and roles, placing them under house arrest. The civil war subsequently concluded and talks were held between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Island. While spending more time with the Traveler,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Reflections of Mortality}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Transient Dreams}}</ref> Ei came to realize that her beliefs had been wrong from the start and decided to take a more active role in giving her people the happiness they deserved, abolishing the Sakoku Decree.

===Military===
Inazuma has three military forces - the [[Shogun's Army]], the [[Watatsumi Army]] and the Shuumatsuban. The Shogun's Army is the primary army of Inazuma; the Watatsumi Army simply upholds order on their lands while the Shuumatsuban is a clandestine force.

There are some ranks in the Shogun's Army - recruits, captains and samurai. Polearms are the common weapon of choice for non-samurai, while samurai exclusively use swords and bows, given that the art of the sword is highly regarded in the nation.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaedehara Kazuha|Something to Share: Bamboo Blades}}</ref>

===Motto===
One of the national mottos of Inazuma (especially one during military campaigns) is "Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!"<ref>Inazuma, Interactible: [[Statue of The Seven]]</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|Character Details}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Kujou Sara|Elemental Burst|note=First Voice-Over}}</ref>

The corresponding motto in the Japanese localization and the Chinese original can be translated as "The one who hath spread the unchanging way is the eternal Narukami!", where the "unchanging way" means the unconditional truth of life and the universe, while Narukami ("Thundering God" or lit. "Roaring God") is a title of the Raiden Shogun {{lang|ja=常道を恢弘せしは、永遠なる鳴神なり！|ja_rm=Joudou wo kaikou seshi wa, eien naru Narukami nari!|zh=常道恢弘，鸣神永恒！|zh_rm=Chángdào huīhóng, Míngshén yǒnghéng!|zh_lit=The unchanging way [is] immense, Narukami [is] eternal!|sort=ja,zh}}.<ref group="Note">Etymologically, the archaic and literary phrase {{lang|''joudou wo kaikou seshi [mono]''|ja=常道を恢弘せし[者]|ja_tl=[The one who] hath spread the unchanging way}} probably comes from {{lang|zh=恢弘至道|zh_tl=spread the supreme way|mini=1}} in ''Preface to the {{w|Book of Documents}}'', an ancient Confucianist commentary text attributed to the Chinese philosopher {{w|Kong Anguo}} (156 BC? - 74 BC?). It was chosen here perhaps because Confucianism was the state philosophy of Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan. The "supreme way" is replaced here with the "unchanging way," a philosophical term from the first sentence of ''{{w|Tao Te Ching}}'' by {{w|Laozi}}, the most important classic of Taoism.</ref>

==Religion==
Compared to Mondstadt and Liyue, Inazuma's religious devotion is much more visible in their culture, as Shogunate-held islands worship the Shogun. The people of Watatsumi Island worship Orobashi instead.

A long time ago, a group of islanders on [[Tsurumi Island]] worshipped [[Kanna Kapatcir]], calling her the Thunderbird. Due to unusual circumstances surrounding the island, they did not have any contact with the rest of Inazuma, as they believed that certain death awaited those who traversed the foggy ocean. This tribe was wiped out after [[Ruu]] sacrificed himself to appease the Thunderbird when he felt that the situation on the island was becoming worse.

==Travel Highlights==

===Inazuma Travelogue===
As a sailor, my dream has always been to explore all the regions of Teyvat. I haven't been on the fleet for long when I wrote this note. I was on the deck of the Black Ignis, headed towards Inazuma at the time. I'm a little embarrassed to say this, but this is my first time at sea. I felt overwhelmed facing the raging storm. The Chief Mate, Tongsheng, didn't seem particularly talkative, but he taught me a lot about sailing. The old sailor that lived with me told me many tales about Inazuma in his spare time. I wrote all these stories down to pass the time during the long voyage.

Inazuma, the land of eternity. It is said that the sea surrounding Inazuma is engulfed by storm and tempest. To break through the thunderstorms, one must rely on a fleet of experienced sailors and the strongest ships. But once you pass through the thunderstorms, Inazuma is surely a sight to behold. The first time I heard about it, I thought the sailors were exaggerating the storms to brag about their experiences. But yesterday, I experienced the impact of the violent thunderstorms and I must say, it is not easy to make a living on the vast ocean. This made me more fascinated with Inazuma. I must say, after being on the water for so long, I miss life on land and the feeling of my feet on soil. I miss the musky scent of the earth. But if I had to choose again, I would not hesitate to step back on deck. After all, life at sea is so much more interesting than the day-to-day life, and there are so many unknown areas to explore and stories to be heard.

It is said that the customs in Inazuma are very different from those of other countries. Unlike Mondstadt or Liyue, Inazuma is located in the distant sea and consists of many islands. There are several small islands scattered around the large islands, and the people on those islands rely heavily on ships to communicate with each other.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - Inazuma Travelogue 1.png|300px]]

We are currently sailing towards Ritou, that is part of Narukami Island. Inazuma City is located on Narukami Island. Cherry blossoms are planted all over this island. In the season when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, the petals are like clouds. When walking underneath them, they will fall like rain and you will soon notice you are covered in cherry blossom petals... The old sailor proudly showed me a painting of a Shrine in Inazuma. It showed that it was his meticulous work. The blooming cherry blossoms are indeed unforgettable.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - Inazuma Travelogue 2.png|300px]]

Ritou is the only way to enter Inazuma for outlanders. Before stepping onto Inazuma, you must go through the administrative formalities with the Kanjou Commission, or you might run into trouble. The old sailor said in a serious tone that made me think he must have had experienced it before. But once you enter Ritou, you can take a breather and enjoy the atmosphere and customs of Inazuma.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - Inazuma Travelogue 3.png|300px]]

After being on the sea for so long, I long for food on land. Looks like there are many specialty cuisine in Inazuma? The old sailor described to me an Inazuman dish called Sakura Tempura: golden and crisp on the outside, but with a faint fragrance of cherry blossoms. When you bite into it, the shell is fragrant and crispy, with a delicious filling. Having said that, the old sailor swallowed and I felt a little hungry myself. I looked forward to Inazuma that much more.

[[File:Teyvat Travel Highlights - Inazuma Travelogue 4.png|300px]]

It's time for me to get back to work on deck, my note today shall end here. There is a faint rumble of a thunderstorm in the distance. I've heard that the Raiden Shogun is responsible for this. I guess there must be a reason behind it. If you have free time, talk about the old tales of Inazuma with the old sailor. I think the stories are very interesting. I still have a small bottle of treasured wine in my bag, which would be perfect for a time like this...
