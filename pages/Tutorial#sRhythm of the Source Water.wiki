|text1    = [[Arapandu]] taught you this song. It has the power to control the [[Varuna Contraption]].<br>According to Arapandu, the Varuna Contraption once turned the black rain into sweet rain, bringing life to the forest.<br>Performing this tune will cause the Varunastra to activate or deactivate. However, you should probably be more conscientious in its use.<br><br>After all, Aranakula do not like too much rain, as it will impede the growth of plants. Arakunti also said before that "too much rain makes the mushrooms difficult to cook."
