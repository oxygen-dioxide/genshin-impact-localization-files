===Reunion Blessing===
Double Drops: Returning Travelers may use three opportunities each day to gain double drops, with a maximum of 21 opportunities for the duration of the event. These can be used to obtain double the rewards from Petrified Trees in [[Domains]], [[Ley Line Outcrops|Blossoms of Wealth]], and [[Ley Line Outcrops|Blossoms of Revelation]] using [[Original Resin]] ([[Condensed Resin]] is not eligible). The amount of double drop opportunities refreshes every day at 4:00 AM. Remember to use the opportunities in time!

Stellar Reunion's double drops do not stack with other double drops bonuses, such as [[Ley Line Overflow]]. Stellar Reunion charges are prioritized over other double drop events.
