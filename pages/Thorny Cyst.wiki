{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy          = Thorny Cyst

|name_1         = HP Drain
|desc_1         = The active character's HP will continuously be drained by '''1.5% Max HP + 225''' every second until the Thorny Cyst is defeated. Upon entering the area, the player will receive the notification ''"This water has been affected by dangerous creatures, and will deal damage to characters within it"''
|strat_1        = Frequently swap characters and use the many [[Recovery Orb]]s in the vicinity. Bringing [[Lynette]] may be helpful as her talent can show the location of the Recovery Orbs on the minimap.

|name_2         = Vein Extension
|desc_2         = The Thorny Cyst will extend multiple veins from itself towards the walls and will become invulnerable until veins are destroyed.
* Vulnerable veins will glow blue and can be destroyed with the [[Xenochromatic Creature|Xenochromatic Jellyfish's ability]].
* Until a certain number of veins are destroyed, the Thorny Cyst will be invulnerable.
* When the Thorny Cyst is vulnerable, the player may attack it directly. After it loses a certain amount of HP, it will become invulernable again and the player will have to repeat the process of destroying the veins.
|strat_2        = When the Thorny Cyst reaches below 50% HP, it can retract its veins. Rather than swimming towards the vulnerable veins, holding down the Xenochromatic Jellyfish's ability to aim and shoot out the Bing-Bang Hat Bomb can save time.

|name_3         = Enemy Summon
|desc_3         = When the Thorny Cyst is first encountered as well as when it becomes vulernable, it will summon several [[Fontemer Aberrant]]s to attack the player.
|strat_3        = Avoid fighting the Fontemer Aberrants as it is not necessary and it may cause the fight to take longer, which is undesirable due to the continuous HP drain.
