* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.2, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows：
** Phase 1: Vanguard Moon
*** After the challenge begins, when a character's Elemental Energy is greater than or equal to 50%, they will gain a 6.5% ATK Bonus every second. Max 10 stacks. When a character's Elemental Energy is less than 30%, the ATK Bonus gained this way will be cleared.
** Phase 2: Chiliastic Moon
*** After the challenge begins, when a character's Elemental Energy is 100%, they will gain 1 stack of Auspice every second. Max 10 stacks. When this character unleashes their Elemental Burst, all Auspice stacks will be cleared, and the DMG dealt by this character will be increased by 5% for each stack cleared for the next 10s. While the character is enjoying the DMG Bonus gained via this method, they cannot gain any more stacks.
** Phase 3: Splendiferous Moon
*** After the challenge begins, when the active character's Elemental Energy is greater than or equal to 50%, they will continuously release shockwaves that deal DMG to opponents. When their Elemental Energy reaches 100%, these shockwaves will deal even greater DMG.

Travelers who experience this issue can exit the game via the Paimon Menu, then log back in to obtain the treasure chest normally.
# Fixes an issue under certain circumstances whereby two [[Remarkable Chests]] near [[Chirai Shrine]] in Inazuma do not refresh normally (these two treasure chests produce the Furnishing Blueprint "[[Official Residence Corridor: Power's Reach]]" and Furnishing Blueprint "[[Inazuman Official Residence: Strict Adherence]]" respectively). If Travelers defeat the enemies in the area on October 21 after 4:00 (Server Time) and before the time of the fix, the Remarkable Chests will respawn the following day at 4:00 (Server Time) after the fix.
# Fixes an issue under some circumstances whereby the trial character "Protector From Afar" [[Thoma]] (Pyro) is able to leave the quest area during the Hangout Event "[[A Housekeeper's Daily Chores]]."

# Fixes an issue whereby there is a small chance that some enemies might not refresh normally when playing games with iOS devices.
# Fixes an issue with the character's homing function whereby there is a chance that it would always target the [[Ruin Hunter]] first, when the character is fighting a Ruin Hunter and multiple enemies at the same time.
#* Note: A similar issue may occur when a character is fighting a [[Ruin Grader]], a [[Ruin Guard]], and multiple enemies at the same time. We are paying close attention to the possible impact of other operations that can produce the same effect. If we have plans to change them in the future, we will announce that as soon as possible.
