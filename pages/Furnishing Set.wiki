'''Furnishing Sets''' are sets of [[Furnishings]] that can be placed together in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. [[Furnishing Blueprint]]s are required to place a set. All furnishings in the set must be in the [[Inventory]] before it can be placed.

==Customizing Sets==
If the player attempts to move a furnishing that is part of a set, the player has the option to either move the entire set or the individual item itself. Choosing the latter and then attempting to move the item more than halfway out of the set's circular boundary will cause a confirmation prompt to appear, as confirming to move the item more than halfway out of the set will no longer make the entire furnishing a set unless replaced once more.

Furnishings in sets can be freely rotated and moved within the circular boundary without causing the set to no longer be considered a set.

Other furnishings can be placed in the set area, but they will not move along with the set unless they are placed on top of a furnishing that carries any furnishings on top of it when moved, such as [[Large Furnishing/Table|tables]].

==Gift Sets==
[[Companions]] each have two favorite furnishing sets. They can manually be invited to their favorite furnishing sets by clicking the prompt that shows up when standing in the center of the set, and they will also automatically invite themselves the first time they are present in the same realm as a favorite furnishing set.

If the companion is already at the Gift Set location and is awaiting dialogue, the Invite Companion screen status will display "Please collect the gifts you currently have." If the companion has been settled in the Serenitea Pot but has not invited themselves to the Gift Set yet because another companion already occupies it, the status will display "Gift event has yet to be completed." If the companion has not yet settled inside the Serenitea Pot, the status will display "Not yet settled." When the gift event is completed, the status will display "Already settled in."

When invited, the [[characters]] will have some special dialogue and give rewards at the end of the dialogue if it is the first time they interact with that set. The rewards consist of {{Item|Primogem|24|x=20}}, {{Item|Mora|30|x=20,000}} and either {{Item|Agnidus Agate Fragment|30|x=1|text=Fragment of Ascension Gem|link=Character_Ascension_Materials#Ascension Gems}} according to the character's element or {{Item|Guide to Freedom|30|x=2|text=Talent Level-Up Guides|link=Talent_Level-Up_Materials/Character_Usage}}, depending on which of their two favorite sets they are interacting with. For reward details, see characters' Housing pages.

Each furnishing set can have at most one invited character ready to initiate their special dialogue. Invited characters will be found at one of a small pool of possible locations within each set.

Receiving 5, 10, and 20 rewards from characters grants the achievements [[Gifts All Around]].
