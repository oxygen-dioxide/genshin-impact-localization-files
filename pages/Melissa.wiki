{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Melissa:''' Let's rest for a moment more. No hurry to head back out to sea.
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Melissa:''' Hello. Here to buy fish?
::'''Melissa:''' Sorry about that, but I'm currently enjoying a no-fishing season &mdash; that is to say, I'm on vacation.
::'''Melissa:''' When not out at sea, one can take a stroll in the breeze, listen to the flowing water, and think about the countless souls that live alongside the fish... Interesting, no?
::'''Melissa:''' It really brings to mind that one phrase, "one who sleeps with dead fishes lives still, but one who sleeps with living fish..."
::{{DIcon}} They...
::'''Melissa:''' Haha, don't take that so seriously. It's just a bit of a vulgar joke amongst us fisherpeople.
::'''Melissa:''' I mean, the line trails off, doesn't it? Why, we could just tack on something silly like "is a [[Blubberbeast]]" or "is a [[Bubbly Seahorse]]," or something like that, eh?
::'''Melissa:''' The underwater world must be a lovely place. Alas, I can't dive, so all I can do is listen to [[Archenoul]] talk about it.
:{{DIcon}} Please excuse me, then.
::'''Melissa:''' It's fine. You're more than welcome to chat with me.
