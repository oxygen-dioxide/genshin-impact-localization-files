==Trivia==
*The first section of "Embrace of Sea Waves" was first heard at the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] in Version 1.6. It plays when the player uses the Waverider during the quest [[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown]] (while lighting up the devices) and at the [[Broken Isle]] (prior to completing the quest [[Who Wields the Wild Wind?]]).
* The second section features a motif from the Inazuma main theme that is also heard in "[[Fall of Maples]]" (based on the ending notes of "[[Inazuma (Soundtrack)|Inazuma]]" from 01:09 to 01:12).
