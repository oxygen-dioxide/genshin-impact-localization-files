==Trivia==
*The first section of "Embrace of Sea Waves" was first heard at the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]] in Version 1.6. It plays when the player uses the Waverider during the quest ''[[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown]]'' (while lighting up the devices) and at the [[Broken Isle/1.6|Broken Isle]] (prior to completing the quest ''[[Who Wields the Wild Wind?]]'').
* The second section features a motif from the Inazuma main theme that is also heard in "[[Fall of Maples]]" (based on the ending notes of "[[Inazuma (Soundtrack)|Inazuma]]" from 01:09 to 01:12).
