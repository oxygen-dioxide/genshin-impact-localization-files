==Profile==
Wayna is the current chief of the Scions of the Canopy.

When [[Kachina]] failed to return from the [[Night Warden Wars]], a group consisting of the [[Traveler]], [[Chasca]] and [[Mualani]] went to Wayna to ask for a [[Spiritspeaker Stone]] that he had borrowed from [[Citlali]]. He asked them why they needed it, and upon doing so, tried to dissuade them from following with their mission. The group was resolved to save Kachina, and Wayna proceeded to give them the stone and directed them to another tribesman, [[Vichama]], to maximize the chance of success. Vichama was able to find Kachina's [[Ancient Name]], but nearly killed himself trying to search for his [[Mallko|friend]], prompting Chasca to destroy the stone. While they went to perform the ritual, Wayna was visited by [[Chuychu]].

Wayna was upset that the stone was destroyed, as it would prompt a harsh scolding from Citlali, though knew that saving a life was much more important and wished for their success.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Reclaim an Ancient Name}}</ref>

Wayna also oversaw the [[Turnfire]] Ritual to help keep [[Kongamato]] in check, though to their dismay, Kinich did not appear to be interested in participating in it. Thus, another tribe elder, [[Trinidad]], sought outside help which was answered by the Traveler. However, none of the group knew that Kinich had an alternative plan, and when the day of the ritual came, revealed that he planned to put Kongamato in a [[Beastly Rift]] provided to him by [[Enjou]]. Wayna was shocked but ultimately agreed to his plan, but before anything could be done, Trinidad smashed the device powering the Beastly Rift and woke Kongamato, prompting Wayna and the others to leave. After Kongamato was calmed down, Wayna and the others came back and took a badly burned Trinidad back for treatment while also noticing a strange shell had appeared around Kongamato. Further examination revealed that the shell protected Kongamato from absorbing and expelling Abyssal energy, which meant that the tribe would no longer have to perform annual ceremonies to purify Kongamato.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Last Turnfire Night}}</ref>

During their travels across Natlan, the Traveler and Paimon came across a [[Strange Yumkasaurus]] at [[Teticpac Peak]] that was guarding a treasure chest. They managed to acquire the chest and found a note inside regarding the Yumkasaur's presence and called Wayna over. Wayna revealed to them that the Saurian's human companion was a deceitful courier who left the tribe after fearing punishment and did not reveal the offender's name. Taking pity on the Saurian, he decided that he would send people to feed it on a daily basis.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lies and Promises}}</ref>

When the Abyss invaded Natlan, Wayna sent out many tribesmen to serve as messengers to bring real-time intelligence across the nation for others to benefit from. Eventually, he was forced to evacuate the village after the Abyss overwhelmed it, but returned once [[Mavuika]] stopped the invasion.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wayna:''' Greetings, friend. I hope you've been holding up well.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself...
::'''Wayna:''' I am the chief of the Scions of the Canopy. You may call me Wayna.
::'''Wayna:''' Some people like to call me "Uncle Wayna," but please don't follow their example. Seriously, I'm not that old.
::'''Wayna:''' To me, "maturity" is more like a fashion style.
::'''Wayna:''' All it means is that I have the most adventuring experience out of everyone in the tribe. It's got nothing to do with my real age. Understand?
:{{DIcon}} I trust you've been well?
:;(Available after completing ''[[Into Eternal Night]]''){{Verify}}
::'''Wayna:''' Of course, of course. Everything here has been going fine.
::'''Wayna:''' What about you? Thinking about taking some risks again?
::'''Wayna:''' I'd consider everything you've done to be quite risky, you know. Going to the Night Kingdom, and breaking Citlali's Spiritspeaker Stone... In my opinion, both of those are extremely important yet risky endeavors.
::'''Wayna:''' It's good to have the spirit of adventure, but it can also be a double-edged sword. I know you won't like to hear this, but it doesn't hurt to be a bit more careful.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Don't worry about me. I'm pretty amazing.
::'''Wayna:''' Haha, confidence. I like it!
::'''Wayna:''' I've heard about you &mdash; the outlander who can use [[phlogiston]]. That's more than just pretty amazing, if I do say so myself.
::'''Wayna:''' In that case, these should be useful to you, right? Take 'em &mdash; and no need to be polite about it.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Embercore Flower|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} About fighting the [[Abyss]]...
:;(Available after completing ''[[No One Fights Alone]]''){{Verify}}
::'''Wayna:''' Ah, well... I suppose it's not going too badly.
::'''Wayna:''' If war with the Abyss was seen as just another type of extreme sport, then there'd be nothing about it that we Scions of the Canopy couldn't handle.
::'''Wayna:''' Just like jumping off a cliff &mdash; some would jump straight back, others land safely, while others might fly off to even farther places.
::'''Wayna:''' Every outcome has a value of its own, and thus, deserves to be remembered.
:{{DIcon}} You too, see you later.
::'''Wayna:''' Farewell for now, my friend.
