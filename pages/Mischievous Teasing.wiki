'''Mischievous Teasing''' is [[Yae Miko]]'s [[Level 5 Constellation]].

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*Considering the Chinese and Japanese names, Yae Miko is probably mocking and teasing the evil deeds of mortals, with the connotation that she also has a compassionate and wise side.
** The Japanese name ''Bouaku Shishou Men'' ("Face That Exposes Evil and Laughs to Scorn") is likely a reference to {{lang|''Bouaku Daishou Men''|ja=暴悪大笑面}}, meaning "Face That Exposes Evil and Laughs out Loud."
** It is one of the eleven faces of Eleven-Faced Avalokiteśvara, a popular manifestation of the boddhisattva {{w|Avalokiteśvara#Manifestations|Avalokiteśvara}}. As Avalokiteśvara is usually associated with compassion, wisdom, and calmness, this manifestation has a serene face at the front side; however, the mocking face ''Bouaku Daishou Men'' is placed at the exact opposite side of the front face, and under this aspect, they are said to expose the evil deeds of mortals and laugh off the absurdity of those who commit evil acts.<ref>Heiankaku: [https://www.e-gojokai.com/staff/bzan4uym06qlw8qb1mlc/ 暴悪大笑面] (Bouaku Daishou Men)</ref>
** While the Shinto deity {{w|Inari Ōkami|Inari}} (known for divine fox messengers) is most commonly identified with the Buddhist goddess {{w|Dakini}}, both Inari and Dakini are sometimes associated with Eleven-Faced Avalokiteśvara.
