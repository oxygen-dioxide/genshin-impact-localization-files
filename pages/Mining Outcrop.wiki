'''Mining Outcrops''', also known as '''Rich Ore Reserves''', appear in the open world as clusters of 2–3 [[Magical Crystal Chunk]]s and one of the following:
* 2-3 [[Crystal Chunk]]s in [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]] and [[Sumeru]]
* 3-5 [[Amethyst Lump]]s in [[Inazuma]]
* 3-5 [[Condessence Crystal]]s in [[Fontaine]]

{{TOC Limit|2}}
==Unlocking==
Before [[Adventure Rank]] 30, Magical Crystal Chunks do not appear in Mining Outcrops.

==Respawning==
Mining Outcrops appear near certain regular Crystal Chunks but respawn independently from them.
A number of these outcrops spawn daily: 6 outcrops in Mondstadt, 10 in Liyue, and 8 in Inazuma; the locations are chosen randomly based on the locations of the [[Ley Line Outcrops]] for the day.

Mining Outcrops respawn at 6am which is 2 hours after each daily reset, at which point all un-mined outcrops from the previous day despawn, along with any markers from the Mining Outcrop Search feature.

The outcrop south of the artifact domain is underground--start at the Statue and approach from the south. The Gandha Hill outcrop is also underground, start from the northeast Statue and approach from the north. Both of these require progress in the Agnihotra Sutra questline.

The northeast Devantaka Mountain outcrop is underground, near the Ruin Drake boss. The two outcrops near the robot are also underground, one is just inside the cave leading to the robot, the other is under the robot's hand and requires completing most of the Vimana Agama questline.

The two outcrops in the Hypostyle Desert are deep underground and requires significant progress in the Golden Slumber questline in order to access it.

==Mining Outcrop Search==
Upon reaching [[Reputation]] Level 2 in any nation, players can speak to certain NPCs in that region to mark nearby mining outcrops on the map.
The main blacksmith NPC for the nation will mark half of the outcrop locations in their nation.
Each of the other NPCs can mark up to 1 outcrop location nearby whenever the player asks them about nearby mining outcrops.

Markers will disappear after the player mines all the Crystal Chunk and Magical Crystal Chunk in the outcrop or when the outcrop despawns at the end of the day.<!--
We need a map of all Mining Outcrop locations so we can mark the exact range of each NPC.
-->
===Notes===
*The main blacksmith NPCs choose locations to mark when the Mining Outcrops spawn. 
**The blacksmiths will mark fewer locations if the player first mines a location the NPC chose to mark.
** The blacksmiths can only mark a subset of all possible locations for each possible Mining Outcrop spawning configuration, but seem to choose the exact locations somewhat randomly within that subset.
*Other NPCs will mark an unmarked and unmined mining outcrop location nearby, if any exist when they are spoken to.
**Mining the ores spawned by the outcrop at the location marked will allow these NPCs to mark another location that satisfies the same criteria when spoken to again afterwards.
**Speaking to these NPCs before speaking to the main blacksmith of the nation will '''not''' allow these NPCs to mark the locations chosen by the main blacksmith.
**These NPCs will mark ores in a fixed order; each time they are spoken to, they will mark the first location in an ordered list of locations that that can mark that is unmined and not marked by the main blacksmith.

==Spawning Logic==
Mining Outcrop spawn locations in each nation are based on the initial locations for the Ley Line Outcrops in that nation for the day.

===Mondstadt===
{| class="article-table"
!Blossom of Revelation location!!Blossom of Wealth location!!Mining Outcrop Locations
|-
|Windwail Highland<br>(North of [[Cecilia Garden]])||Southwest of Springvale
| rowspan="2" |
The 2 locations immediately west and southwest of [[Springvale]] always spawn.

The other 4 locations are chosen randomly from the other 4 possible [[Windwail Highland]] locations, the one on [[Brightcrown Canyon]] and the southern canyon in [[Brightcrown Mountains]]. 2 in [[Wolvendom]].
Wagner marks 3 of these.
|-
|Windwail Highland<br>(East of the Statue of The Seven)||Dadaupa Gorge
|-
|West of the Thousand Winds Temple||North of Windrise
| rowspan="3" |
Like above, but only 3 locations are chosen from Windwail Highland; the remaining location is east of the [[Thousand Winds Temple]].
|-
|North of Windrise|| West of the Thousand Winds Temple
|-
|Windrise||Stormbearer Point
|-
| Dadaupa Gorge||Windrise
| rowspan="2" |
The 2 locations west and south of [[Springvale]] always spawn, along with 1 chosen randomly from Windwail Highland. Wagner will mark all of these.

The remaining locations are the 2 in Stormbearer Mountains and Stormbearer Point and the 1 east of Thousand Winds Temple.
|-
| West of the Thousand Winds Temple||Stormbearer Mountains
|-
|Stormterror's Lair||Windwail Highland (North of Cecilia Garden)
|
All 6 outcrops are located in [[Brightcrown Canyon]], the southern canyon in [[Brightcrown Mountains]] and [[Windwail Highland]], barring the 2 locations west and south of [[Springvale]].
|-
|Stormbearer Point||Stormterror's Lair
|
All 6 locations spawn randomly from the 8 possible in Stormterror's Lair.
|}

===Liyue===
{| class="article-table"
!Blossom of Revelation location!!Blossom of Wealth location !!Mining Outcrop Locations
|-
|Southern Lisha||Sea of Clouds mainland
| rowspan="2" |
The two locations on Mt. Tianheng are guaranteed to spawn.

The remaining 8 locations will be chosen randomly from the 8 possible in Lisha and the 1 near Luhua Pool.

Master Zhang will randomly choose 5 of these locations to mark, <u>excluding</u> the 2 locations on Mt. Tianheng and the 1 near Luhua Pool.
|-
|Northern Lisha||Sea of Clouds mainland
|-
|Northern Lisha|| Southern Lisha
| rowspan="2" |
Approximately half of the time, the mining outcrop spawns and locations marked by Master Zhang will be the same as above.

The other half of the time, the outcrop near Nantianmen and/or the one near Tianqiu Valley will be added to the pool of available outcrop locations, <u>replacing</u> the two locations on Mt. Tianheng, which will not spawn (in the case that only 1 of the Nantianmen/Tianqiu Valley spots spawns, the remaining spot will be in Lisha). In this case, Master Zhang will always mark the mining outcrop near Nantianmen or Tianqiu Valley, in addition to 4 random others, excluding the 1 near Luhua Pool.
|-
|Southern Lisha ||Northern Lisha
|-
|Sea of Clouds mainland ||Guyun Stone Forest
| rowspan="5" |
The 4 outcrops in Guyun Stone Forest, the 2 outcrops on Mt. Tianheng, and the outcrop near Luhua Pool are all guaranteed to spawn.

The remaining 3 locations are chosen randomly from the 8 possible locations in Lisha. Master Zhang will mark The Lisha and Luhua Pool locations and seems to randomly choose one of the two Mt. Tianheng outcrops to mark as well.
|-
|Guyun Stone Forest||Yaoguang Shoal
|-
| Yaoguang Shoal||Sal Terrae
|-
|Sal Terrae||Stone Gate
|-
|Stone Gate||Qingce Village
|-
|Jueyun Karst|| Bishui Plain northwestern islands
| rowspan="2" |
Same as above, but only 2 locations in Lisha will spawn; the last location will instead be the eastern-most Minlin location.

Master Zhang will mark all 4 locations in Lisha (including both the ones on Mt. Tianheng) and the one in Luhua Pool.
|-
|Bishui Plain northwestern islands ||Jueyun Karst
|-
|Bishui Plain northwestern islands||South of Qingyun Peak
| rowspan="2" |
All 10 locations are chosen randomly from the Qingyun Peak and Mt. Aocang areas and the location at the northernmost Minlin Teleport Waypoint and the one east of it. Master Zhang seems to randomly mark any 5 locations.

(It appears that the version including the Jueyun Karst Ley Line Outcrop is more likely to include the Mining Outcrop east of the northern Minlin Teleport Waypoint.)
|-
|Jueyun Karst|| South of Qingyun Peak 
|-
|South of Qingyun Peak||Nantianmen
|
All 10 locations are chosen randomly from the locations in Minlin, <u>excluding</u> the eastern-most one. Master Zhang seems to randomly mark any 5 locations, excluding the ones near Tianqiu Valley and Nantianmen.

(It seems that no more than 8 outcrops can come from Qingyun Peak.)
|}

===Inazuma ===
The Mining Outcrop spawn logic for Inazuma has not been determined yet.

Usually, two islands are chosen to spawn Mining Outcrops each day.
The first island, where the first Blossom of Wealth is located, will have all of its locations spawn; the remaining location(s) will randomly spawn on the second island.
The two islands are the ones that initially have the Ley Line Outcrops for the day. Hajime will always randomly mark 4 of the locations on the island that had all locations spawn.
All of the islands (except Watatsumi Island) have 6 mining outcrops so all 6 will spawn on the island marked by Hajime. The remaining 2 mining outcrops will be on the other island with a Ley Line Outcrop for the day.

The only exception to this spawn logic is if Hajime marks out mining outcrop locations on Watatsumi Island. All 7 mining outcrops on Watatsumi Island will spawn and one additional random spawn will be found on Seirai Island, regardless of the location of the Leyline Outcrops.

However, there seems to be a very rare chance of this spawn logic to not be applied and the Mining Outcrops spawning in different islands. These rare cases still follow the "6 spawns in one island and 2 in the other" pattern, the island with 2 spawns will be the one with the Blossom of Wealth and Hajime will still mark 4 outcrops of the island with 6.

===Sumeru===
{| class="article-table"
! Blossom of Revelation location
!Mining Outcrop Locations
|-
|Lokapala Jungle
| rowspan="4" | 8 of these 10 locations will spawn:

*The spot east of [[Pardis Dhyai]]
*7 locations in the Northeast of the Sumeru Rainforest
*The 2 underground spots in the [[Hypostyle Desert]]. These spots almost always both spawn, or don't spawn at all.
|-
|Desert of Hadramaveth (both locations) 
|-
|Realm of Farakhkert
|-
|Hypostyle Desert
|-
|Ardravi Valley
|This location has two spawn patterns. Having [[Ahangar]] mark some locations will help in determining the pattern for that day.
'''Spawn Pattern 1:'''

*1-2 of the easternmost spots in [[Apam Woods]]
*3-4 of the [[Devantaka Mountain]] spots
*2-3 of the western Apam Woods spots, including the Desert spawn by [[Caravan Ribat]], and the spot far west of Pardis Dhyai

'''Spawn Pattern 2:'''

*2 of any of the spots in easternmost Apam Woods or Devantaka Mountain
*The 5 spots located in the Northeast of the Sumeru Rainforest, excluding the one under the [[Spire of Solitary Enlightenment]] Domain and the northernmost spot.
*The spot east of Pardis Dhyai
|-
|Land of Upper Setekh
| rowspan="2" |
*5 of the 6 aboveground Desert locations are guaranteed; the northeasternmost spot (by Caravan Ribat) will not spawn.
*Both of the underground Desert locations are also guaranteed.
*The final spot is either the northernmost one in the rainforest or the one under the Spire of Solitary Enlightenment domain.
|-
|Land of Lower Setekh 
|-
|North of Pardis Dhyai
|
* 4 of the 5 aboveground Desert locations mentioned above.
* The 4 spots grouped around the northwest of Pardis Dhyai
|-
|North of Apam Woods 
|
* 1 of the 4 spots in the northwest of Pardis Dhyai
*The 7 spots around the west of Apam Woods, including the Desert spawn by Caravan Ribat, and the one far West of Pardis Dhyai.

There is a rare chance that this location only spawns 7 of the 8 daily Mining Outcrops. The missing spot will not be the random spot in the northwest of Pardis Dhyai.
|}

===Fontaine===
As of Version 4.2, the possible Mining Outcrop locations are as follows:

Beryl Region (5): Behind the Northwest Waypoint (where the Breachers are), the north beach (due north of where the label "Elynas" is on the map), south of the Northeast Waypoint (Look for Romaritime Flowers and Hydro Phantasms), Statue of the Seven, and across the bridge near the southernmost Waypoint

Belleau Region (3): South of Poisson, near the southernmost Waypoint, and outside the Denouement of Sin (Artefact Domain).

Court of Fontaine Region (2): Below the balcony behind the Palais, southern side of the plateau that Earnshaw's Farm is on.

Research Institute (6): North bay,  New Research Institute, near the Northeastern ruins, the easternmost Waypoint, North of the Southeastern waypoint (the remarkable chest spot), and West of the Experimental Field Generator.

Erinnyes Forest (2): North of the Rusty Rudder Waypoint and North of the Easternmost Waipoint.

Morte Region (2): Both outcrops are located near the hill on the small islet connected to the Ford Chaybdis Ruins island.

<u>Spawning Logic.</u>

Estelle will mark four outcrops in the 4.0 Areas (Beryl, Belleau, Court of Fontaine), in the 4.1 Area (Research Institute) or in the 4.2 Areas (Erinnyes Forest, Morte Region)

If she marks the 4.0 Area, all outcrops will be found there. If she marks the 4.1 or 4.2 areas, all possible mining outcrops located in either area will spawn with the remaining 2 (in case the 4.1 Region is marked) or 4 (if the 4.2 region is marked) will be distributed in a random manner across the 4.0 areas.

There does not seem to be any pattern regarding how the outcrops are distributed across the 4.0 Area in either spawn pattern.

== Search Strategies==
For all nations, talking to the main blacksmith first will always provide the most information.

;Mondstadt:
*After talking to Wagner, if the Ley Line Outcrops indicate that there are exactly 4 spawns in Windwail Highland, it may be worth talking to the other NPCs:
*#First mine the locations marked by Wagner except the location in Brightcrown Canyon. If the location north of the northern Windwail Highland Teleport Waypoint is marked, make sure to check the location near the Teleport Waypoint as well.
*#If the final location in Windwail Highland has not been found yet, check the location in Brightcrown Canyon.
*#If the final location still has not been found and the location north of the northern Windwail Highland Teleport Waypoint has not been checked yet, talk to Davy.
*#If the final location still has not been found, it must either be the one near the [[Wolf of the North Challenge]] or the one in the pass leading to [[Stormterror's Lair]]. Mine the two locations west and south of Springvale Village, then talk to Draff; he will mark the location at the [[Wolf of the North Challenge]] if it has spawned, or will mark nothing if the other location spawned. (Note that this will only work if the two Springvale locations are completely mined out; otherwise, he will mark those first.)

;Fontaine:
*As mentioned before, there are three observed spawn patterns so far (as of Version 4.2).
*Bring a combat-ready team for the 4.0 outcrops, as they are near aggressive mobs.
*Most Fontainian Mining Outcrops are very close to Waypoints or other teleport locations.
*Research Institute outcrops will spawn together.
*NPCs
** It's likely easier to simply check Earnshaw's Farm or dive off the balcony behind the Palais instead of using Remande to search for outcrops.
** Hinterman and Cava are very close together, so players may find it convenient to use both these NPCs to search. Simply take the Waypoint to Poisson, climb up the ladder to the fish stall for Hinterman, then glide down to the bottom floor of Poisson to speak with Cava (he moves back and forth across the bridge, so it's easy to spot him.)
*** Cava only checks the two outcrops on the West Slopes.
***Hinterman checks the North Beryl Region. It is unknown if he can check the Northwest Waypoint.
**Cheriez is at Romaritime Harbor, next to your teleport destination. He appears to only check Denouement of Sin and the southernmost Beryl outcrop.
