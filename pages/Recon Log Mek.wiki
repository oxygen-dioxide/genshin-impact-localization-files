==Descriptions==
{{Description|One of the earliest new-type clockwork meka to be made.<br>It is said that during his time at the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]], the [[Alain Guillotin|Lord-Artificer Guillotin]] created machines that could simulate genuine intelligence.<br>Though he never openly admitted it, this rumor nonetheless spurred on subsequent generations of ambitious engineers. Decades ago, [[Mosso Lombroso|one of them]] announced that they had created [["Curve"|a machine]] that not only possessed basic thinking abilities but could also read human emotions, but in the end the results went unacknowledged.|[[Archive]]}}
