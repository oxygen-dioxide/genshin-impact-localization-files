'''Jiu''' {{Lang|zh=阿鸠|zh_rm=Ā Jiū}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the [[Historia Antiqua Chapter]], Act II: [[No Mere Stone]].

Before No Mere Stone was released in [[Version 1.5]], Jiu was a regular NPC located by the [[Dragon-Queller]], a massive tree with blue veins found between [[Mt. Hulao]] and [[Nantianmen]]. Her dialogue made it apparent that she held [[Morax]] in contempt and instead worshiped [[Azhdaha]], an ancient dragon sealed underneath the Dragon-Queller. After being removed from the overworld in Version 1.5, her dialogue is no longer accessible.

No Mere Stone revealed the truth behind Jiu as a coalesced part of Azhdaha's spirit. She is not a possessed human like [[Kun Jun]], but is fully Azhdaha, the embodiment of his rage. She was originally sent out to see if the people of Liyue remembered Azhdaha. Enraged after finding out they did not, Azhdaha started his plan to escape from his seal.

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Despite taking the form of a young girl, Jiu seems to be much older than she appears &mdash; she speaks about humans as if she isn't one of them and mentions events that happened thousands of years in the past. She also describes Morax as an usurper, yearning for the resurrection of the ancient being trapped underneath the Dragon-Queller.

In her dialogue, Jiu talks about an ancient being that has been trapped under the tree by the [[adepti]] thousands of years ago and tells the player that its resurrection is coming soon. A nearby stone tablet indicates that the being is the "evil dragon" [[Azhdaha]], who was suppressed and trapped in the tree by the adepti to preserve lives in the world. However, this being is slowly consuming the tree and becoming one with it, giving a section of the tree blue veins and ghostly blue branches. When the dragon emerges, it will entirely consume the tree and absorb the energy of all the ley lines of the world.

During the events of No Mere Stone, Jiu lures away a [[Missing Miners|mining team]] to excavate the area underneath the Dragon-Queller. [[Zhongli]], the [[Traveler]], and a man named [[Kun Jun]] catch her trail while investigating the team's disappearance and follow her into the [[Beneath the Dragon-Queller|domain underneath the Dragon-Queller]], where it is revealed that she is in fact a mortal vessel representing Azhdaha's wrath and desire for revenge towards Morax and humanity.<ref name="ZLA2Q4">{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref>

To hasten the destruction of the seals binding him, Azhdaha created Jiu so that she could work on breaking the seals from outside while his main body broke them from within. Doing this, however, also allowed a fragment of his conscience that still retained his memories and goodwill towards humanity to escape in order to warn Morax of the danger. This fragment went on to possess Kun Jun's body, but because of a lack of power, he was unable to remember his purpose &mdash; only that he had to seek out a legendary ore called [[Dragonfall]]. The fragment of Azhdaha possessing Kun Jun remembered everything during the battle against the dragon's main body and assists the party in the event that a character is knocked out.<ref name="ZLA2Q4" />

After Azhdaha's main body is subdued for a second time, Kun Jun confronts Jiu and reveals the truth about themselves: how Morax had granted Azhdaha the ability to see and live aboveground, and the two became close friends before "erosion" wore away at Azhdaha's memories and sanity, forcing Morax and the adepti to seal him away. In his last act of clarity, Azhdaha realized what was happening and allowed himself to be sealed away, but erosion made him forget that part as well, causing him to believe Morax betrayed him. As the energy used to sustain Jiu wore out, she faded away with Morax's name on her lips.<ref name="ZLA2Q4" />

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jiu:''' You're a little early... Are you here to witness the resurrection of the most ancient, most awe-inspiring individual in Liyue's history?
:{{DIcon}} Do you mean Rex Lapis?
::'''Jiu:''' Hah... That usurper?
::'''Jiu:''' Humans... They care only about history since the dawn of the age of mankind...
::'''Jiu:''' Are people really happy to just draw a line under the litany of atrocities humanity's ancestors are responsible for, call it "ye olde worlde," and just get on with their merry little lives?
::'''Jiu:''' Well, I hope that anyone who willfully indulges in this fantasy world of false prosperity will be consumed by it, and thus get what they deserve.
:{{DIcon}} Resurrection?
::'''Jiu:''' The adepti thought to suppress it with trees. Hah! Fools! Little did they know that after thousands of years... the trees that hold the beast shall surely become one with the beast...
::'''Jiu:''' And lo, it shall stretch wide its arms, and unfurl its body, and reach out with its roots... And the ley lines of the world shall heed its call.
::'''Jiu:''' Then, once the beast has quenched its great thirst for that energy which only the ley lines can provide...
::'''Jiu:''' I imagine any significance we presume to have in this world will vanish for good. Wouldn't you agree?
:{{DIcon}} I didn't quite follow...
::'''Jiu:''' Oh don't worry... You will see.

==Trivia==
*Jiu is the first NPC whose role was retroactively changed to accommodate a Story Quest. While some NPCs had updated dialogue after completing a certain quest, or a quest's dialogue changes depending on the completion of another quest, Jiu was removed from both the overworld and another World Quest she was featured in, [[The Secret of Nantianmen]], regardless of the completion of No Mere Stone.
