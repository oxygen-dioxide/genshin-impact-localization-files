When the current active character is [[sprinting]], [[climbing]], [[swimming]], in movement modes caused by certain [[Talent]]s, or at a certain height in the air, switching to Mavuika will trigger the following: Mavuika enters the [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state and obtains 50% of her maximum [[Nightsoul point]]s. Nightsoul Transmission can be triggered once every 10s by your own [[party]].

'''Exhaust Mode''' is [[Mavuika]]'s [[Night Realm's Gift Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The Phlogiston consumption only occurs when Mavuika is riding Flamestrider.
* Mavuika is able to interact with [[Saurian]]-related exploration mechanics in limited ways:
** She '''can''' enter [[Molten Fissure]] like the [[Tepetlisaurus]].
** She '''can''' enter [[Spiritway]] like the [[Koholasaurus]].
** She '''cannot''' use [[Coilgrass Sigil]] and other grappling hook abilities like the [[Yumkasaurus]].
** She '''can''' withstand [[Gaseous Phlogiston]] and consume [[Gaseous Phlogiston|Scorchwind Conflux]] like the [[Qucusaurus]], but she '''cannot''' enter [[Gaseous Phlogiston|Phlogiston Wind Tunnel]].
** She '''cannot''' leap and scan [[Nightspirit Graffiti]]/[[Nightspirit Sigil]] like the [[Iktomisaurus]].
** She '''cannot''' shatter [[Pulverite]] and utilize dashing movements like the [[Tatankasaurus]], although she has a similar movement outburst like its Second Sprint.
