|text      = It's become common knowledge that I'm never around on my birthday? I have no idea how that happened. I see no basis for it at all.

Just a week ago, I was passing through [[Treasures Street]] when this [[Cyno|big-eared hat guy]] shoved a [[Genius Invokation TCG|stack of cards]] into my hands, saying he had "high hopes" for me. That [[Sethos|green-eyed desert guy]] backed him up too, somehow encouraging me to make friends through card games.

Ridiculous. As if you could form life-or-death bonds over a card table. Even [[Mini Durin|Durin]] wouldn't buy that.

I imagine you won't agree with them either. Between playing card games with strangers and teaming up with you, I'd rather go with the latter.

By the way, I gave those cards to Durin. One day, you might stumble upon him in [[Mondstadt]], sitting by the roadside playing cards. Don't act too surprised.

On another note, do you think "Big-Eared Hat" or "Hat Ears" works better as a nickname?

|character = Wanderer
|note_type = sender
|note      = The displayed sender name is always the Wanderer's current name as chosen by the player during {{Quest|Inversion of Genesis}} or by using the item [[An Appellative Stroke]]. If the player has not renamed the Wanderer, the sender name is [[Wanderer]] in their chosen [[Settings#Language|game language]]. If the player renames the Wanderer after receiving this mail, the sender name changes accordingly.
