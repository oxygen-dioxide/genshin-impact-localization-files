{{Description|Tea grown in warm, moist areas in Chenyu Vale. After millennia of careful cultivation, the tea today emits a rich fragrance that can be savored from several streets away.<br>"Adeptea" is the collective term for the various teas produced in Chenyu Vale: Sunglo Tea, Yunlai White Tea, Bishui Green Tea, Single-Origin Yauwan Tea... Each offers subtle yet wonderful flavor distinctions and requires different tea-making techniques, which may only be appreciated by tea connoisseurs.<br>There are many legends about the tea in Chenyu Vale. The most well-known suggests that an [[adeptus]] planted the first tea tree in ancient days, bestowing its branches to the early residents of the Vale, and the aroma of tea has filled the misty fields ever since. However, these tales now become part of storytellers' repertoires and are told in teahouses, blending with the fragrant steam of brewing tea.|[[Archive]]}}
