|desc_delicious  = The fish fillets are so tender and juicy that they almost seem to come alive in your mouth. The sense of loss is so unbearable when you swallowed a piece down that you just had to treat yourself to another piece.

==Trivia==
* According to [[Zhongli]] in the [[Stone Harbor Treasure Journal]] event, using Violetgrass in Black-Back Perch Stew is the Wanmin Restaurant's secret touch. Based on [[Chef Mao]]'s baffled reaction in the background, Xiangling was the one who came up with the idea.
* This dish is likely based on {{Lang|''shuǐzhǔ-yú''|zh=水煮鱼|zh_lit=water-boiled fish}}, a variant of the {{w|Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan}} dish {{Lang|''{{w|Shuizhu|shuǐzhǔ-ròupiàn}}''|zh=水煮肉片|zh_lit=water-boiled pork slices}}.
* It is one of [[Yun Jin]]'s favorite foods.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yun Jin|Favorite Food}}</ref>
