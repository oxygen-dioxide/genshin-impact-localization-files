==Trivia==
* In the [[Gliding Instruction Manual]], Rudolf has violations in Gliding after jumping into a two-story house in hopes of pleasing his daughter. This has led to his left leg getting fractured and part of his buttocks got bruised and his violation has caused his gliding license to become suspended for a year.
