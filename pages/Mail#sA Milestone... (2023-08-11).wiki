Today is my birthday, and in the words of the surveyor corps, I've reached another milestone in life.

The officers often say, "As the years of service pass, knights must surpass their selves of years past." I've received a lot of positive feedback from my superiors recently, so I believe I've fulfilled that requirement. Though thinking back carefully, the reason I've been receiving so much recognition is entirely due to your guidance and encouragement. Thank you for all the help you've given me lately!

It's a pity that I can't invite you to celebrate together as I'm on field duty lately. So, I've prepared two of my signature dishes. I would be really glad if they're to your liking.

When I'm back in Mondstadt, I'd be sure to thank you in person!
