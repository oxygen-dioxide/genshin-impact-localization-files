==Overview==
The Thirteen Lords were regional rulers under the Pyro Dragon Sovereign [[Xiuhcoatl]], each of whom governed over an individual territory in Natlantea. On occasion, they would gather together in a council called the [[Chamber of Deliberation]], presided over by the First Lord as Speaker, to deliberate and vote on certain matters. They and Xiuhcoatl survived the invasion of [[Teyvat]] by the [[Heavenly Principles]] through hiding inside the underground city of [[Ancient Sacred Mountain|Tollan]].<ref name=Record2 /> 

It is unconfirmed, but likely, that the "CL" abbreviation in the Lords' titles refers to their title of Ch'ule-L, meaning they would all share [[Ixlel]]'s title of Type-L Self-Regulating Overseer Array Integrated Processing Unit.<ref name=OYHtM>{{Ref/Quest|Open Your Heart to Me}}</ref>

==History==
During the [[Great War of Vengeance]], the Dragonlords slew countless [[angels]] in their territory, leaving only [[Yohualtecuhtin]] alive.<ref>{{Ref/Item|page=Blazing Sacrificial Heart's Hesitance|quote=... those envoys from the skies above, under whose guidance the earthly civilizations had thrived, were devoured by the awakened dragons ...}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=Revelations from the Past|quote=The pitch-black flames scorch the land, and even the white tree nearly withered, and the final envoy's glow shattered and smashed, only able to subsist on the last leaves of the severed roots.}}</ref> They oppressed the humans of Natlantea upon their return; only the Eighth Lord, Ix Ajkotz'i'q Iq'ismal, is known to have had cordial relations with humanity, raising a human daughter ([[Lianca]]) as a dragon princess.<ref name=Record3 /><ref name=ChainBreaker>{{Ref/Weapon|Chain Breaker}}</ref> Lianca later founded the tribe of [[Tlalocan]], and fought against the other dragonlords with Xbalanque.

Due to the Regent [[Kukulkan]]'s experiments on humans, the Sovereign Lords eventually voted to impeach him from office; he later assisted the humans in their rebellion, teaching them how to use [[phlogiston]]. Some time after this, Lianca shot down the Sixth Lord using her longbow,<ref name=FoAT /> and [[Ixquieh]] & [[Ahpub]] tricked the Tenth Lord into being buried under a mountain.<ref name=Yaxche /><ref name=Record2 />  Ten of the Lords died when [[Xbalanque]] invaded the [[Ancient Sacred Mountain|Sacred City of Tollan]] with his army, leaving at most three lords alive at that point.<ref name=OtSSoJ /> It is implied that the Eighth Lord was not slain in combat, but was instead executed by the consensus of her fellow Lords during the siege.<ref name=Record3 />

The Ninth Lord was left alone in the depths of [[Chichen Uctokah]] without any means of escape. Following the death of [[Xbalanque]], the Ninth Lord's [[Perfect Heart of the Sacred Dragon|Core]] was uncovered by an excavation team led by [[Manqu]].<ref name=Priest>Interactable, Vucub Caquix Tower: [[Vucub_Caquix_Tower#Nameless_Priest's_Notes|Nameless Priest's Notes]]</ref> Kukulkan's half-human son [[Och-Kan]] imprisoned her within a statue and attempted to coerce her to do his bidding, but failed; as a result, he decided to separate his human consciousness from his draconic body to make a new [[Core of Chu'ulel]].<ref>Interactable, Ochkanatlan: [[Holy Sovereign's Notes]]</ref> He would remain trapped inside until a couple of decades after the [[Cataclysm]], when the adventurer [[Bona]] freed him.<ref name=MoA>{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref> During Och-Kan's reign, the surviving Sixth Lord was finally killed by Lianca's second daughter.<ref name=FoAT />

In the modern day, both Och-Kan and the Ninth Lord finally perished at the hands of the [[Traveler]], during the quests ''[[Moment of Awakening]]'' and ''[[Open Your Heart to Me]]'', respectively. Ajaw was freed from his mountain prison by [[Kinich]] during an excavation; the two formed a contract, such that Kinich will receive Ajaw's power, but Ajaw will eventually take over Kinich's body at the moment of his death.<ref name=Kinich>{{Ref/CS|Kinich|Character Story 5}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Each Lord's name takes the form "[Gender] [Title] [Number] Ch'ule-L." 
*Due to transferring his consciousness to a Core of Chu'ule-L as [[Cocouik]], it is possible that [[Och-Kan]] would himself qualify as a Dragonlord.
===Etymology===
*The Lords' names are all derived from {{w|Mayan Languages}}, and share some common features:
** ''Ch'ule-L'' ({{w|Tzeltal_language|Mayan Tzeltal}}: ''Chʼulel'') means "essence" or "soul." It is the inner, individual soul which has thirteen parts and is centered in the heart.
** ''Aj'' (Mayan: ''{{wt|aj#Epigraphic_Mayan|aj}}'') means "man." It is the "male prefix" used to form male titles. It is related to the title Ajaw (Mayan: ''{{wt|ajaw}}'').
