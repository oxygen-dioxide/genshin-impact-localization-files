The '''Arsenal''' is a cave located underneath [[Tatarasuna]], near the [[Mikage Furnace]].

To be able to access the area around the Arsenal, part of [[Tatara Tales (Quest)|Tatara Tales]] must be completed so that the Mikage Furnace area can be unlocked; before then, the Containment Field will prevent players from entering. The Arsenal itself can be entered after obtaining 3 [[Key to Some Place|Keys to Some Place]] that are found around Tatarasuna in [[Common Chest]]s. Upon first entering the Arsenal, three [[Ruin Sentinels]] will spawn.

In the Arsenal, there is a [[Luxurious Chest]] that contains 30 [[Primogem]]s, 30,000 [[Mora]], 3 [[Hero's Wit]] and [[Diagram: Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]], which is used to unlock the forging recipe for the [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]]. Obtaining the diagram grants a {{Achievement|Blade of Tatara}}.

Additionally, there is 1 [[Electroculus]] and an [[Toki Alley Tales|Enigmatic Page]].

==Location==
The Arsenal is located south of the [[Mikage Furnace]] in [[Tatarasuna]]. The gate to the Arsenal is located near the water on the east side of the cave.

==Lore==
Several years after the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]] became an Inspector for the [[Inazuma Shogunate]] and spent his time at [[Tatarasuna]]. He developed an interest in bladesmithing there and eventually forged the Daitatara Nagamasa with the help of Armory Officer [[Miyazaki]]. After it was forged, his group celebrated the accomplishment; [[Nozomu]] made a painting of it, while [[Katsuragi]] and the "nameless eccentric," now known as [[Scaramouche]], performed a sword dance.

However, a certain incident shortly afterwards broke up the group. Mikoshi Nagamasa had flown into a rage after Katsuragi committed some "malefesance." He slashed Katsuragi with the Daitatara Nagamasa &mdash; thereby earning it the name "Katsuragikiri Nagamasa" (Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa) &mdash; and then threw the blade into the furnace. Nozomu salvaged the blade, but in doing so suffered fatal burn wounds. Miyazaki and Kinjiro both believed that Nagamasa could no longer be reasoned with, and so Kinjiro hid the remains of the blade and Nozomu's painting of it in the Arsenal.<ref name="aged">Interactable: [[Rather Aged Notes]]</ref>
