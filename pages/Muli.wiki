:'''Muli:''' Hello there, tall guest. Do you know how to fish?
:{{DIcon}} Haven't fished much...
::'''Muli:''' Then let's go fishing together! Fishing is one of the most interesting things in the world!
:{{DIcon}} I'm an ace angler!
::'''Muli:''' Really? In that case, do you... think it's possible to fish up jadeware?
::{{DIcon}} Why would you even think that...
::'''Muli:''' I love fishing, especially when it's with [[Qiongjiu]]!
::'''Muli:''' But father says that someone must take over our family's jade business...
::'''Muli:''' So it would be perfect if I could fish up some jadeware! Don't you think so too!?
::'''Muli:''' Or maybe I'll ask Little Mao to learn how to make jadeware while I go fishing with Qiongjiu! That would be great too!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Muli:''' Bye! I'm going to continue thinking about fishing!
