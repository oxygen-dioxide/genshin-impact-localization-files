==Descriptions==
{{Description|A café that enjoys a fairly long history. It is not only a place that serves authentic Sumeru-style coffee, but also a rare social gathering space in the city that people from all walks of life like to frequent. Its acting manager is good at reading customers' fortunes from the coffee grounds. Word has it that her reading is even more accurate than those done by professional diviners at the bazaar.|[[Map]] description}}
