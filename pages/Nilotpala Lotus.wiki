==Descriptions==
{{Description|Growing in the forest wetlands, these plants only bloom at night with flowers as bright as the moon.<br />In the oldest folk tales of this land, the great chariot of the moon goddess once shone with a light that matched the sun. At this time, all things in the world were at peace. But the arrows that tore the skies apart would shatter the gems that adorned the most ethereal of vehicles, and the people would behold the visage of the sovereign of the moonlit nights no longer. The many flowers would turn and serve a new master, but the Nilotpala Lotuses would bathe in the cool moonlight and continue to remember the glad songs of that afore-time.|[[Archive]]}}
