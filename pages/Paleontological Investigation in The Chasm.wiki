==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You notice some rocks with peculiar markings on them. It's better to take a few pictures. Perhaps someone might know what these are...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approaching the first strange rock the player finds)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, look, these rocks here have some weird patterns on them... is that a picture? But what does it mean?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's take a picture of it first. Maybe we'll meet someone who can understand that picture.
----
;(Talk to Khedive)
:'''Khedive:''' What a curious geological environment we're in now! I'm sure I can outdo the research goals set by the Akademiya this year.
:'''Khedive:''' Oh, Traveler, what's up?
;(Talk to Khedive)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About the strange rock we found...
:'''Khedive:''' So, you took a picture or two of some strange rocks?
:'''Khedive:''' Do show me, please!
:{{DIcon}} Here you are...
:'''Khedive:''' Ah! Look at the picture! It's so clear &mdash; seems the new Kamera models from Fontaine are as good as they say.
:'''Khedive:''' I once bought some prototype ones, but the images captured weren't clear enough. Besides, they were too clumsy to be handled by one person alone. So they ended up rotting away in some corner in the Akademiya.
:{{DIcon}} Rotting away...
:{{DIcon}} That's a bit of a waste...
:'''Khedive:''' Yep, it cost me a meal's worth of Mora. Um... Looks like it's time that I bought some new Kameras.
:'''Khedive:''' But anyway, I've digressed. Let me have a look. This rock...
:'''Khedive:''' Yes, it's a fossil!
:{{DIcon}} A fossil?
:'''Khedive:''' Yes, and you can see many fossilized marine creatures in it... How curious! In Liyue, there's a saying for this &mdash; I don't know the exact wording, but it goes something like "forests and fields are eventually engulfed by the vast ocean."
:'''Khedive:''' The fact that the fossil appears in The Chasm proves that these creatures were buried underground in an instant. Otherwise, their skeletons wouldn't be so perfectly preserved.
:'''Khedive:''' By the way, I heard that this place has frequent earthquakes. It makes sense, as one of the prerequisites for fossil formation is active geological movements.
:'''Khedive:''' This finding will certainly shed new light on our understanding of the ancient creatures that once inhabited this place...
:'''Khedive:''' But I think I could use a few more pictures.
:'''Khedive:''' If you come across other such fossils, please take pictures for me.
:{{DIcon}} How many do you need?
:'''Khedive:''' Let me see. I need four or five for my report... You know what? Let's make it five. Bring me five pictures of similar rocks.
:'''Khedive:''' I'll offer a reasonable price for this, of course. It is a big discovery, and that is no understatement.

;(Take pictures of more fossils &mdash; if the player doesn't have them all already)
----
;(Give the fossil pictures to Khedive)
:'''Khedive:''' What a curious geological environment we're in now! I'm sure I can outdo the research goals set by the Akademiya this year.
:'''Khedive:''' Oh, Traveler, what's up?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Here's the pictures of the fossils you asked for...
:'''Khedive:''' Great, these are some nice pictures!
:'''Khedive:''' Certainly worth the resources of the exploration team.
:'''Khedive:''' Look, these are all bones of ancient marine creatures. You can see their structure very clearly.
:'''Khedive:''' This means that this place used to be beneath the ocean's surface before it became The Chasm.
:'''Khedive:''' What a pity we aren't in Sumeru. Otherwise, I would have them brought back to the Akademiya to begin research right away.
:'''Khedive:''' We can't afford to have miners accidentally tampering with these fossils. We need to hire people to take some precautions. Yes, I'll bring this up next time I meet up with the people of the Ministry.
:'''Khedive:''' But...
:{{DIcon}} But?
:{{DIcon}} You're not gonna tell me you need more pictures, are you?
:'''Khedive:''' I'll... settle for these ones.
:'''Khedive:''' But as I said, these fossils are perfectly preserved, their structure intact. And this means one thing.
:'''Khedive:''' That they were buried underground in an instant.
:'''Khedive:''' Nearly all fossils you found at The Chasm are located at a fixed altitude.
:{{DIcon}} A fixed altitude?
:{{DIcon}} It's not that fixed, is it?
:'''Khedive:''' Well, geologically speaking, the difference in height is minuscule.
:'''Khedive:''' This means it was a quick process &mdash; and nearly all fossils here formed at almost the same time. Basically, something must've radically altered the ecosystem here in a split-second.
:'''Khedive:''' I'd say something like a huge shock wave, of sorts.
:'''Khedive:''' Hmm, what could've happened in The Chasm?
