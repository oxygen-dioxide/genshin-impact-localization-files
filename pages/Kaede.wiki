===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Radiant Sakura]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kaede:''' Hmm? You're talking to me... Are you a customer?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Kaede/Raiding the Statue Shop (Again)|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Kaede:''' Ah, why don't you buy a doll? Maybe it'll give you better luck...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Kaede:''' Ack... How? I can't believe I lost because of this...
:{{DIcon}} So, what's this shop all about?
::'''Kaede:''' We mainly sell souvenirs, like Inazuman novels, tanuki dolls, and stuff like that.
::'''Kaede:''' Back then... we might also have sold statues of the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]] and other related goods as well.
::'''Kaede:''' Sadly, we haven't really seen that many customers since the lockdown came into effect except for those [[Snezhnaya]]n merchants who want to entertain their families.
::{{DIcon}} What kinds of dolls?
:::'''Kaede:''' Our featured products are statues <!--dolls--> of fox spirits and porcelain tanuki dolls. Uh... tanuki dolls sell a bit better.
:::'''Kaede:''' They represent good fortune in Inazuma. Many business owners buy one to place in their stores, hoping for financial success.
:::'''Kaede:''' They look really cute as well! It's not a bad idea to gift them to your favorite girl or the children in your family.
::{{DIcon}} Statues of the Shogun?
:::'''Kaede:''' Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
:::'''Kaede:''' *sigh* It used to be our best-selling product...
:::'''Kaede:''' Sadly, we've lost our customer base ever since the lockdown happened. And such a delicate item is not cheap to craft, so we've had no choice but to take them off the shelves.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kaede:''' *sigh* So you're not here to buy anything after all, are you...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Radiant Sakura]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kaede:''' Again, seriously&mdash; uh, I mean, hello, how may I help you?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} So what do you sell here?
::'''Kaede:''' We mainly sell souvenirs, like Inazuman novels, tanuki dolls, and stuff like that.
::'''Kaede:''' Back then... we might also have sold statues of the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]] and other related goods as well.
::{{DIcon}} What kinds of dolls?
::;(Same as before)
::{{DIcon}} Statues of the Shogun?
:::'''Kaede:''' Yeah, our Almighty Shogun is a merciful and forgiving person who doesn't really mind people buying the statues for any reason whatsoever.
:::'''Kaede:''' Before the [[Sakoku Decree]] was instated, it used to be our best-selling product... But the old edition long ceased production.
:::'''Kaede:''' I've heard that a new model is being developed, though...
:::'''Kaede:''' I should keep an eye on developments on that front. This is a business after all... But it's such a bother...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:;(Same as before)

===After ???===
<!-- check requisite conditions -->
<!-- Got this alternative dialogue after completing Transient Dreams and also completing Buyer's Guide to the Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder during Hues of the Violet Garden event. The content of the dialogue seems relevant to the event quest. Maybe this replaces the original dialogue after the event ends, even without completing the quest. -->

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After looking for [[Yae Miko]] in [[Festive Elegance]])
:'''Kaede:''' Wow. The Irodori Festival hasn't started yet, and there are already so many people on Ritou...
:'''Kaede:''' Well, dear customer, you'll have to wait till the festival starts to get one of our Statues of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder!
:'''Kaede:''' ...Ah, you're not here about the Shogun Statues? Sorry, we've just gotten so many queries concerning those recently.
;(Continue non-event dialogue)

;(After completing [[The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture]])
:'''Kaede:''' I never thought that Ritou would play host to a festival by the Yae Publishing House, nor that this many people would show up.
:'''Kaede:''' Thanks to the Irodori Festival, our Inazuman products and toys have been very popular indeed, even those that aren't necessarily part of our event-specific promotions.
;(Continue non-event dialogue)
