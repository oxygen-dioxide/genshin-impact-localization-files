'''Test Run - Character Trial Event''' is a Recurring [[Event]] that allow players to try out the promoted characters' gameplay in special [[Domains]] for a [[Character Trial]]. The character's combat specs are fixed, and food items cannot be used. By completing each challenge for the first time, players can gain various rewards such as [[Primogem]]s, [[Adventurer's Experience]], [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]], [[Mora]], [[Local Specialties]], [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s.

There are Test Runs for each of the characters featured on the current [[Character Event Wish]]. Exceptions to this are the characters who are obtained for free (i.e. [[Noelle]] and [[Xiangling]]), although they can still appear in other character's test runs as secondary trial characters. [[Barbara]], [[Collei]], [[Lynette]] and [[Kachina]] had character trials upon their releases, and are now used as secondary trial characters.

To start a Test Run, open the [[Paimon Menu]] and choose the Events button, which will list the current Test Run, permanent events not yet completed, and other limited time events currently running.
