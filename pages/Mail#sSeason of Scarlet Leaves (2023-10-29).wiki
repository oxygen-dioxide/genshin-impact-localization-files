|text      = The weather is cooling, and the season for the mountainsides to be covered in a sea of red is here. Captain [[Beidou]] recently led the crew to [[Yilong Wharf]], where we've been staying. Just to the west, across the vast sea, is Fontaine's [[Lumidouce Harbor]]. I remember you mentioned before that you were going to travel to Fontaine, and I know not if you have already left your footprints upon their lands. If it is as I guess, then why don't you raise your gaze and look to the east? I am looking at you too, from across the sea.

We are both moving onward on our own journeys and in the long days since our last meeting, the stories and experiences of our travels have become stacked high in our hearts like the great mountains themselves.

Should you have any free time, it would be wonderful if you could recount your tales to me.
