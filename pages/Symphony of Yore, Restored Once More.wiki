{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon obtaining a musical score)
:'''Paimon:''' It looks like a new movement! Quick, put it in the music box so we can give it a listen!
:;(Open Autoharmonic Music Box interface)
----
;(Talk to the Nameless Stone Statue in Portus Anticus, optional)
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' O golden-haired outlander, valiant hero... Do you truly exist, or are you another shade in my dreams?
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' No, that isn't important. Come, friend, join my dream. A sweet dream can drive away the anxieties that consume us. Come, slave, fetch us some wine, that we may partake in hearty enjoyment.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' I am Quentus Venusianus, once an honored musician.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' But a name is a transient glory, bereft of meaning. It is sweeter than a song, but is as ethereal as the clouds.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Noble, lowly, all names drift within [[Phobos]]. Take me, for example. I, the scion of freed slaves, gained everything in the song, and lost it all there too.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' [[Remuria|Our empire]] is long gone, its hope, long fallen. Just like this once-great thriving harbor, my name was ruined in antiquity amidst ill omen, tossed as if into a sea of glass.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Life is brief. Distant yearnings prove unwise. Only the dream of the present is worth longing for. All other labors only heap dreams upon dreams.
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about this place?
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' This was once Portus Anticus, outlander, the interstice of reality and dreamscape. The glorious [[Fortuna]] once docked here, displaying the supreme authority of the empire to all.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' As you can see, the mast has long snapped, and the divine statues are nowhere to be found. Our living pursuits were in vain, and no sheen of golden cosmetics could console the wailing dead.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Yet all this matters not. The ocean wind has stolen our final days, so why not continue wandering in dreams? Why not order slaves to bring forth the fine wine, the perfumes, and roses that wither all too soon?
::{{DIcon}} You don't seem very upset about all this.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' And why should I be? The pale-white god of death knocks on the hovel hatch of the indignant and the pearl gates of the opulent alike. All goes as Phobos wills.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Enjoy the days fate has allotted you. Scorn not sweet love, and demur not joyous dance.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Since the frosted gloom has not encroached upon your shining golden hair, then I say unto you &mdash; embrace gentle slumber at the appointed hour.
::{{DIcon}} Farewell.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Fare ye well also, friend! May you, too, witness a dream of equal beauty!
:{{DIcon}} Farewell.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Fare ye well also, friend! May you, too, witness a dream of equal beauty!

;(Talk to the Nameless Stone Statue near the bell, optional)
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' I must solve these structural issues posthaste...
----
;(Talk to the Nameless Stone Statue in Caesareum Palace)
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Good champion, please, rest your wandering feet here for a spell...
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here...
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' It is just as you see, valiant warrior. I and my brothers-in-arms defend this place, just as we have every day for millennia.
::{{DIcon}} A legion? You've got help, then?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Caesareum Palace was what we named it once, but today, naught is left but wrack and ruin.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' I and fellow legionnaires of Legion Athanatoi defend it still, as we have for thousands of years.
::{{DIcon}} A legion? You've got help, then?
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' In the past, yes, but they have departed.
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Or perhaps they laid down their obsessions and hatreds over the winding years. Perhaps, they were even consumed by said passions, casting duty aside and embracing senseless slaughter.
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Only I still stand guard here.
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Noble warrior, come you from the capital? Could you bring word to the citizens there that Legio VI has done their duty &mdash; that not a single vishap has passed our leaguer?
:{{DIcon}} Are there still vishaps in here?
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Nay, not for many years now... But the history of our battle has been recorded in the "Symphony" somehow, playing over and over like an opera...
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' I, too, cannot discern truth from illusion. Do you wish to enter and see? A champion from the capital will see no danger there, so please, inscribe our history using your hands and eyes.
:{{DIcon}} Take me there.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Of course. Remember to return here once you come out.
:;(Begin combat challenge)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do at the moment...
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' It is fine. Once you are free of other concerns, do not neglect to come see me.

;(Talk to the Nameless Stone Statue again, if "I've got other things to do at the moment..." was chosen)
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Good champion, please, rest your wandering feet here for a spell. Tell the citizens of the capital that we have done our duty.
:{{DIcon}} Take me there.
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' Of course. Remember to return here once you come out.
:;(Begin combat challenge)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do at the moment...
::'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' It is fine. Once you are free of other concerns, do not neglect to come see me.

;(Talk to the Nameless Stone Statue after completing the challenge, optional)
:'''Nameless Stone Statue:''' (The statue has lost its luster. The soul within seems to have departed...)
:{{DIcon}} Investigate
:{{Black Screen|At the foot of the statue, you discover an inscription that wasn't visible before...}}

;(Read the Mysterious Inscription, optional)
:'''Mysterious Inscription:''' "Good champion, please, rest your wandering feet here for a spell. Tell the citizens of the capital that we have done our duty, here we defeated ... cruel vishaps, obedient to their command..."
