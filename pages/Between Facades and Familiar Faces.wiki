{{Dialogue start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), hurry! It's almost time for us to join Hu Tao for dinner!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh, and we'll be meeting at... Xinyue Kiosk! It's the place with a reaaaally long waitlist!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As expected of the parlor director &mdash; always so generous! C'mon, let's go!

;(Enter Xinyue Kiosk)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' ...Ohh, so that's how it is! Thanks for the suggestions, Mr. Zhongli! I have them all noted down.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I've long heard that your knowledge encompasses all things old and new, Mr. Zhongli, but I never knew that you were well-versed in the art of cooking, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It is truly an honor to make your acquaintance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' No need for formalities. I, too, feel humbled to be in the company of such talented young people. There are many things I could learn from you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh, y&mdash;you flatter us!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Um, if it's possible... May I trouble you to provide a few words of guidance for my practices in exorcism...
:{{Introductory Note|Chongyun}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Exorcism? I can't say I'm an expert in the field, but if you don't mind, we could start by discussing...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! There's so many people here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All we knew was that Hu Tao invited Zhongli over. Paimon never thought we'd be meeting so many old friends, hehe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Happy Lantern Rite, everyone!
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Likewise. Please, take a seat.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Happy Lantern Rite! Are you having fun?
:{{DIcon}} I'm learning a lot.
:{{DIcon}} I've become musically cultured.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Me too. I've seen Xinyan perform before, but this is the first time I've watched something like this.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I heard that the audience loved it too, and she's been receiving quite a lot of performance invitations lately. She's more busy than ever, and Yun Jin's gonna help her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yep, and they asked us to pass on their season's greetings to everyone. They hope we'll have a wonderful gathering.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' The performance was spectacular indeed. However... it gave Xiangling a huge burst of inspiration, which in turn gave us a bit of a headache...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' "Us"? Did Xiangling ask you to try out her dishes too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Ahaha! That, my friend, is beside the point. Watching you eat was enough for me, haha.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' (Come to think of it, I probably shouldn't have burdened Chongyun with eating my share too...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, Xiangling came up with a new recipe? *gasp* Let Paimon try!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' See? Someone here knows how to encourage people! Thanks, Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, and I have to thank Mr. Zhongli too. He gave me lots of useful pointers that really drove it home for me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's what you were talking about before we arrived!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes. Since we'll be dining together, the topic of our conversation naturally revolved around cooking.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Xiangling's ideas are truly unconventional. Her choices in both ingredients and spices are comparable to a melody dancing on the tongue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' My suggestions were nothing more than the icing on the cake.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh! The two of you always deliver!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hehe... Now I'm getting embarrassed...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Anyway, I'll get everyone to have a taste after I've adjusted the recipe based on Mr. Zhongli's advice!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm... That sounds like it might become a little safer to eat.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' How about I sample the dishes next time?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of eating... Paimon feels like we're missing someone...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hu Tao was the one who invited us, but she's not here! And, oh, where's Guoba?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, Guoba volunteered to help dad at the restaurant!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You know, lots of people come over to eat during Lantern Rite. Without Guoba helping out, I probably wouldn't have had the time to accept Hu Tao's invitation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' As for Hu Tao...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The director went to collect a guest. She asked me to stay here and host you for the time being.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Seems like it's almost time...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Hu Tao went to fetch someone in person? Oh, that must mean they are super important!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could it be... Keqing? Ningguang? Or... Captain Beidou?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' She didn't clarify. And, as her subordinate, I couldn't just pry into the details, could I?

:'''Suddenly, the door to the restaurant bursts open as if struck by a hurricane...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ta-da! We're~here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' We're not late to the party, right? Right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Good thing the Conqueror of Demons and I are both as swift as the wind. And whoosh! We made it just in time!
:<!-- no audio -->'''Paimon:''' !
:<!-- no audio -->'''Xiao:''' !
:{{DIcon}} !
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I see... so the important guest is the Conqueror of Demons. I've been looking forward to meeting you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The director didn't mention anything when she invited us. What a pleasant surprise... Gathered here with us tonight are not only young and accomplished individuals, but also the protector of Liyue's peace, Adeptus [[Alatus]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' To convene here with all of you is indeed a great honor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Uhhh...

:'''A few days ago, at Wangshu Inn...'''

;(Flashback begins)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...It's almost Lantern Rite, yet you took all the trouble coming here...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' *sigh* The director has a way of making it difficult to decline...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Rex Lapis... May I ask what troubles you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The director asked me to buy sesame oil in preparation for the celebrations.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Then why would you... come all the way to Wangshu Inn...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I had a pleasant chat with Chef Yanxiao and received some spices from him. And... see? Here's some matsutake and a portion of ham.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' What about the sesame oil...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Mm... It's a shame. I couldn't find the kind the director was looking for.
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I'm sure you're exaggerating, Zhong&mdash; Ahem, Sir.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ugh, there he goes again! Enough with the pleasantries. Go let our guest take a seat.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Everyone here today is well-known in their own field and has probably heard about one another to some extent. Some of us are even old acquaintances, so there's no need to be this formal.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I heard that the Conqueror of Demons and (Traveler) are pretty close, no?
:{{DIcon}} We're old friends.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Great! You two sit together!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You should take a seat too, Director.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh? Finally remembered me?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' When we arrived just now, the hosts at Xinyue Kiosk told me our dishes are almost ready. Perfect timing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Let's not wait any longer and ask them to bring out the food.

:'''The delicious-looking food arrives, and a pleasant scent fills the air. You all cautiously begin eating while conversing quietly...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon would've never guessed the person Hu Tao went to fetch was Xiao...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' That's also the first I've heard of (Traveler) and Paimon being friends with the Conqueror of Demons.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know Xiao too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' "Knowing" is a bit of an overstatement. I've always looked up to him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' You might not know this, Paimon, but we exorcists have worked in close collaboration with the Conqueror of Demons for many generations, dispelling evil together, both in the open and from the shadows.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hard to imagine that thanks to Hu Tao, I've finally gotten the chance to meet him... Conqueror of Demons, I am honored to make your acquaintance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Likewise.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It is a great honor indeed to have a chance to meet the legendary Conqueror of Demons. Chongyun has brought that name up quite a few times in the past.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I remember you mentioning wanting him to understand the importance of exorcists...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Ahem!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Uh, we know each other too!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 13.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' He helped try my dishes during the [[Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go|Masterful Chefs cook-off]]!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 14.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hehe, I didn't think we'd have the chance to meet again. Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' No anecdote, however, compares to meeting you in person. I'm Xingqiu, Xiangling and Chongyun's friend. The pleasure is all mine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, everyone's getting all formal and polite all of a sudden... Paimon doesn't know what she should say anymore...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Adeptus Xiao... Mighty Conqueror of Demons! Please accept Paimon's greetings, too! Belated Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{DIcon}} "Belated" isn't the right word to use here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon tried very hard to look for a fancy word, okay? Don't be too harsh on Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' There's no need to be so polite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' ...Tch!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You're right. This was meant to be a nice little get-together between friends, after all. Too much formality kills the atmosphere.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 13.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I didn't plan this gathering only for everyone to walk on eggshells, ai ya!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's your true intention, then...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 14.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' A little get-together between friends, sipping the finest tea, and watching lanterns float into the sky. Bidding farewell to the past, and embracing the present with joy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 15.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' And that is something our consultant would say. I think it deserves a standing ovation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. Exceptional acting skills, Director.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 16.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' As for me, I'm just here to have fun and treat everyone to something good!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 17.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' We all worked really hard this year. Whether traveling or guiding...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 18.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Cooking, helping with the family business, exorcising evil spirits, or conquering demons...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 19.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' And of course, our consultant, who's been helping out at the parlor every now and then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 20.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Everyone has done some pretty amazing things.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 21.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' As the one who brought everyone together, it goes without saying that I'm the one most deserving of praise!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Sounds kinda self-important, but Paimon thinks it's pretty amazing that she managed to talk Xiao into coming... He rarely ever enters Liyue Harbor, after all.
:{{DIcon}} I'm curious about how she did it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It wasn't as complicated as you think.

:'''Not long ago, at Wangshu Inn, again...'''

;(Flashback begins)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 22.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' ...Okay gotcha, thanks, boss lady!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk verrgoldet 01.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' It's not boss lady, just boss!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk verrgoldet 02.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' And there she goes... What a lively girl.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 23.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Conqueror of Demons! Adeptus Xiaaaaao!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 24.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Guardian of Wangshu Inn! Hero of Dihua Marsh!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 25.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I know you're thereeee!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Tch...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 12.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Quiet! Do not disturb the peace.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 26.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Sorry! But you wouldn't show up if I didn't yell your name, would you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...I know you. You're the 77th Director of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 14.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Is there something you need?
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Haha, that does sound like one of Hu Tao's antics.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Did the Conqueror of Demons agree to come so that Hu Tao would stop pestering him...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' There might be other reasons.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 27.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, smart guess.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Huh? There's more to it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 28.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It gets pretty boring from here on. I talked about the funeral parlor's past relationships with the Guardian Yakshas &mdash; you know, just to be sociable.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 21.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In the time of the [[Archon War]], disputes were frequent, and disaster overtook the land. Humans couldn't escape from the torment of the plague, nor could they escape death.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 22.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The adepti vanquished the demons, the Millelith fought valiantly, and Wangsheng Funeral Parlor was responsible for purifying the diseased and sending off the spirits of the dead.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 23.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That is how the border between life and death was maintained during the war, and it effectively prevented further incidents from happening.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 29.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' That's right! One point for the consultant!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 30.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' But despite our deep-rooted connection, it still took me quite a while to actually convince him.
:{{DIcon}} Was he worried about his karma?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 31.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You know him pretty well, huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 15.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' This matter is out of my control, so I need to be cautious.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 32.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' True, but I've kept that in mind too! That's why everyone here today is in one way or another acquainted with elemental power.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 33.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Besides, it'll only be for a short while as we dine together. There won't be any lasting consequences.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 16.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' But I didn't... expect there to be so many people.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' There's no need to worry, Conqueror of Demons. We're not feeling anything unusual so far.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Our young exorcist over here is protected by his pure-yang energy, so he's probably the most resilient.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Th&mdash;That's not the same!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' And did you just toss your carrots into my bowl? Hey, don't look away!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 13.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh? What?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 16.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I'm siding with Chongyun. I saw that too!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 17.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You're lucky Guoba isn't here today. He hates seeing people being picky with their food &mdash; if he'd seen that, he'd definitely make you eat all your carrots!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 14.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh!? Guoba would do that? Is he that uncompromising?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 15.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' But now that I think of it, Xiangling told me that Guoba used to be the Stove God...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 24.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hahaha, it sounds like you've heard the rumors.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 17.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} You seem pretty quiet today. Is everything okay?
:{{DIcon}} Not used to being around so many people?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 18.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I'm doing fine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 19.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Not long ago... before Lantern Rite, I met an old friend.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 20.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Thanks to his help, things have been a lot more stable than before.
:{{DIcon}} That's good to hear. Give everything you don't eat to Paimon.
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! ...Wait, what?
:{{DIcon}} An old friend?
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 21b 1.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You should know him. He's...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Whoosh... whoosh...
:{{DIcon}} (Huh? The wind?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 02.ogg}} '''???:''' "Seeds of story, brought by the wind..."
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "...and cultivated by time"!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Did Paimon just unconsciously complete that saying?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That voice... Could it be...
:{{DIcon}} (It must be...!)
:<!-- no audio -->'''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 34.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hm? If I'm not mistaken, there's someone knocking at the door.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 35.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Don't just sit there, Zhongli! Go welcome our guest in!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 03.ogg}} '''???:''' No such need! I'm coming in!

:'''The door to the restaurant gets blown open by a gust of wind again...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, you finally let me in!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hello, hello! No matter if we've met before or not, this moment marks a brand-new encounter! Old friends and new, happy Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! It's the Tone-Deaf Bard!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 22.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' !?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 36.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ooohh! He seems to carry a valiant breeze wherever he goes... It looks like we're gonna be friends!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 37.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Fate has brought us together, so c'mon, take a seat and be my guest! Help yourself, I'll ask them for another set of cutlery.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Mhm, this young lady here is as bright as a fresh bouquet of flowers and the morning's rising sun. She no doubt is the one with the most authority here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Whoa, these dishes look amazing... Is it really okay for me to join in? Hehe, alright, I'm digging in!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 16.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Ah, it's you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh! Isn't this Zhenyu...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 38.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Mm? Zhenyu?
:{{DIcon}} (Oh no, he's gonna give Xingqiu's pen name away...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Yep, now that I've taken a closer look... You're a fan of Zhenyu's works, aren't you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I met Xingqiu at a [[What the Blue Flowers Left Behind|light novel convention]]. Ah, how I wish we'd met sooner!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I never expected that there'd be another person in this world who could interpret Zhenyu's new novel as thoroughly as I could!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 17.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Venti, you're being too humble. Considering your poetic talent, your fundamentals are way more impressive.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 25.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ahem... Could this new guest be Master Xingqiu's friend?
:{{DIcon}} He's my old pal too.
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 12a 1.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Yeah! Xiao, you remember me too, right? We had a chat not long ago.
:{{DIcon}} Looks like Xiao knows him, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 23.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Yes, yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 24.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Monsters become more active than usual as we get closer to Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 25.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I was patrolling Dihua Marsh a few days ago when I happened to run into this... this...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 13.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hm? You've already forgotten? I'm a bard, remember?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 14.ogg}} '''Venti:''' And bards go around singing wherever they like!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 26.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Oh, right, and this bard was performing in Dihua Marsh.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 27.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It was a... moving melody, and it made me feel relaxed and at ease. I... couldn't help but stay and listen.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 15.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, thank you for your patronage!
:{{DIcon}} So that's how it was. I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 26.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I understand now, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 27.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I'm Zhongli, currently working at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. It's a pleasure to meet you, new friend.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 39.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Mm-hmm, and I'm his boss. Oh, and if there's anything unsatisfactory, let me know anytime!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 28.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That's very considerate of you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 16.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh? Hmm, no wonder. Only a boss as savvy and reliable as you would be able to hire such an impressive consultant!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 40.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, you're too nice, Venti.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 41.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Not to brag, but our consultant truly is impressive. His knowledge extends across the stars and the land, and there's nothing throughout history that he doesn't know.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 42.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' From the sophisticated way he speaks, it's hard not to suspect that he could very well be an adeptus in disguise! Hehe.
:<!-- no audio -->'''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 43.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Xiao, you're an adeptus! Do you think it might be possible?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 28.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 29.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Sorry, I'm only good at conquering demons. I'm afraid I don't have much knowledge in that matter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, really?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon thinks you're super knowledgeable...
:{{DIcon}} (Paimon, play along!)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 29.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, ohhhh! Riiiight...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 30.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Xiao's a warrior. He doesn't come to the city very often, so it's, uh, pretty normal for him to not know anything... Yeah...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 17.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ehhh? Really?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 18.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I've actually heard a few things about Mr. Zhongli before.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 19.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The guests in the tavern talked about this refined and courteous man who, instead of having wine at Mondstadt's finest tavern, ordered a cup of hot tea with the most complex name.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 29.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...Now that you mention it, I seem to recall that there indeed is a musician like yourself in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 30.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I've heard that he's elegant and amiable, his works witty and vibrant. It's no overstatement to regard him as the best bard in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 20.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Now you're making me embarrassed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 21.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I would say that Mondstadt's poetry is a little run-of-the-mill sometimes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 22.ogg}} '''Venti:''' There's one I heard a while back that went: "The old house is renewed, welcoming the spring breeze, awakening old memories."
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 23.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The meaning's there, but the word choices are unimaginative, and there's a distinct lack of literary flair.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 44.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I think so too. The composition needs a little jazzing up.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 45.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' If I were to give it a go, I'd make it...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 46.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' "An old melon on a vine, a new flower that grows fine."
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 24.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ohh, good one! It feels unique, and has a nice ring to it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 47.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You have great taste, Venti, I was right about you! Let's shake hands.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 25.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Of course, of course!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 31.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 31.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 18.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' ...Hey, Xingqiu.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 18.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 19.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Mind lending me a few books when we get back? Pick out some well-written ones.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiangling 20.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I don't know if it's my own lack of literary knowledge, but I couldn't tell the difference between those two...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk chongyun 14.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I don't think it's your fault...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xingqiu 19.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Chongyun's right. It's not our fault.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, watch and learn from Hu Tao and Venti. This will come in handy for your ugly nicknames.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 31.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, you have a point!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 32.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But speaking of, why is the Tone-Deaf Bard here? Are you here to take part in the Lantern Rite too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 26.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I heard that Liyue will be hosting a Lantern Rite music festival this year. As a musician myself, how could I possibly resist the temptation to come take a look? ...Or a listen?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 27.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Getting to know other musical styles is essential to sparking inspiration, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} (Huh, but the music festival wasn't planned beforehand...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 28.ogg}} '''Venti:''' As for the [[Dvorak|Fontaine friend]] who hosted the festival, I saw him near Stone Gate the other day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 29.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The [[Iridescence Tour]] has finally been held successfully for once, so I had to congratulate him.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you. He must feel very grateful.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 30.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Don't think anything of it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 31.ogg}} '''Venti:''' By the way... I was watching as you entered Xinyue Kiosk, but no one seemed to notice me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 32.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Should I say that it's because I'm an expert in hiding, or that a certain someone deliberately ignored the sound of the wind...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 32.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha... Whenever Lantern Rite comes around, Liyue Harbor becomes bustling with activity.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 33.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' People are all busy watching the lanterns and strolling around the shops, and they might just go travel somewhere on a whim. It is rather difficult to predict another's whereabouts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 34.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The festival is in full swing and proceeding smoothly, and we're all gathered here with friends new and old. This is no doubt a wonderful occasion worth celebrating.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 35.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' To come together with all of you at the beginning of the year, one can't help but be filled with joy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk zhongli 36.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In a moment like this, I propose we raise a glass together. In my case, tea in lieu of wine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 32.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 33.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Very well said, Mr. Zhongli! That was exactly what I wanted to say!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 34.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, now I'm getting a little self-conscious. I didn't cause you too much trouble barging in like that, did I?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk venti 35.ogg}} '''Venti:''' We usually drink wine during occasions like this over in Mondstadt, but since Mr. Zhongli insists on drinking tea, I'll give a toast with tea too! Everyone, thanks for the treat!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 48.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You're welcome! As the host of this gathering, I hope everyone enjoys the food and drinks. May this year be better than the last!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 49.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Considering that everyone may have other matters to attend to later, sticking to tea seems like a good idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 33.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Uhhh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 33.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, all of a sudden, they started proposing toasts! Should... should we...
:{{DIcon}} Xiao!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 34.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' What's with the urgency!?
:{{DIcon}} Are you done eating? Wanna head out for a walk?
:{{DIcon}} I ate too much. Could you come take a walk with me?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk xiao 35.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Sure.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 50.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Have you two finished eating?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk hutao 51.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's always nice to have a breath of fresh air after a meal. Helps with digestion.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 34.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, uh, Paimon will come, too...
:{{DIcon}} You're still hungry, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 35.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... yeah...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, we'll be back soon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 1 talk paimon 36.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay then... Don't forget to come back!

;(Talk to Venti or Zhongli, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It seems like our new friend is an expert in wine.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I deserve no such praise. I only drink for fun &mdash; it's nothing compared to your expertise.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I'm glad we're only having tea today. What if I got drunk and said something nonsensical? I'd surely become an object of ridicule to someone I've just met.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' No such thing. I wouldn't dare disrespect the director's guest.

;(Talk to Hu Tao or Xiangling, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Did you talk about anything interesting before we started the meal? Anything fun I missed out on?
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, we were talking about cooking.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Mr. Zhongli told us that he went on a trip to [[Qiaoying Village]] the other day and got a hold of some uncommon ingredients &mdash; tea seed oil and sesame oil. He suggested I try using those in my new dishes.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ohhh... No wonder he left his post for so long that day.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Those ingredients would be difficult for anyone else to find.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I guess I'll need his help next time as well.

;(Talk to Paimon, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're not allowed to leave Paimon here alone!
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' To be honest... Paimon's worried about saying the wrong thing.

;(Talk to Xingqiu and Chongyun, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' About you and Venti...
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Um, haha...
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Could he be... a partner in your family business?
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' You know how my family is. A lot of business secrets can't just be divulged at the dinner table.
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Ahh, just as I thought.

;(Talk to Xiao, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog talk eqhdj201 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Let's depart. You go ahead.
----
;(Leave Xinyue Kiosk)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Are you alright?
:{{DIcon}} I should be the one asking you that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I... it's hard to describe.
:{{DIcon}} Unfamiliar with gatherings like this?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It's not that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' There were those among the adepti who loved gatherings and idle chit chat. Sometimes, they would call up a few others for a drink. Even I got dragged along to their gatherings, many times.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The adepti all have their specialties, making most of them proud and arrogant. Everything they say is straight from the heart... It never gets too complicated.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' But this time...
:{{DIcon}} I understand. It's all Zhongli's fault.
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 08a 1.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' That's not what I meant!
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 08a 2.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Or perhaps I should say Zhong... Rex Lapis is really good at adapting to human life. You could say that he actually enjoys doing so.
:{{DIcon}} I understand. It's all Venti's fault.
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 08b 1.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' N&mdash;No, I didn't mean that...
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 08b 2.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' So you know his true identity. I'll get straight to the point then.
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 08b 3.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The Anemo Archon is a free spirit, and his temperament is as carefree as the music he plays on the flute. It's easy for a god like him to live in harmony with humans...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' And that's something I might never be able to do.
:{{DIcon}} You don't have to be like them.
:{{DIcon}} You do you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Hmm... That does sound like something you would say.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' No matter. I know my circumstances.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 12.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Whenever I think of the ordinary conversations I've had with you, it feels... strangely novel.
:{{DIcon}} Strange in a good way?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 14.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The parlor director went out of her way with the invitation, so it was difficult to turn her down. I had made mental preparations before agreeing to come.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 15.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' She told me that all the guests today would be "acquainted with elemental power," and I knew that you would be here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 16.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' But I didn't expect the other guests to be...
:{{DIcon}} No one would've guessed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 17.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' General [[Kapisas]] always said that we should live in the present and enjoy every pleasant surprise. Perhaps that's what I should do with what I'm feeling now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 18.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...But I think he meant designing clothes for those around him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 19.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The clothes were intricately designed, but inconvenient to wear. Brother [[Bosacius]] never tried to hide his distaste in front of him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 20.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Rex Lapis did like his designs and even collected quite a few. The [[Hermit of Mortal Life|outfit he wears now]] was also designed by General Kapisas himself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 21.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I never saw him wear this during the war. I didn't expect him to start wearing it later.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, here you are!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Um, I'm not intruding, right...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 22.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You're not. What is it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hu Tao saw that everyone's done eating and asked the staff to bring out the desserts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Paimon got so anxious that you weren't back yet that she scarfed down her dessert without the usual slurping and munching.
:{{DIcon}} But not so anxious that she can't eat. Sounds like she'll be okay.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' To be honest, I was kinda worried too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You looked a little restless just now, and I thought you weren't used to the food here and was planning to head back to Wangshu Inn for something Yanxiao made.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 23.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You're worrying too much.
:{{DIcon}} Xiao, don't pull any [[Lemniscatic Wind Cycling]]s on us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 24.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Why would I.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 25.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Anyway, let's head back.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Please wait!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' There's another reason why I came looking for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Here, take these. I brought them for you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 26.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...[[Almond Tofu]]?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Yup!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Since the Masterful Chefs competition, you could say that Yanxiao and I are not only competitors, but good friends as well! I visit him at Wangshu Inn sometimes to discuss our cooking.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I heard him say that the esteemed guest on the roof loves nothing more than a good plate of Almond Tofu, so I learned a thing or two about the dish from him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 13.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I'll be honest... Before Hu Tao invited everyone, she secretly came looking for me, told me about the guests she planned to invite, and asked me for some suggestions on what she should order.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 14.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' So I made a few servings of Almond Tofu for you guys in advance! Take them as a token of gratitude for your support.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' When I told Guoba that I was making these for you, he started eagerly running around the kitchen and helping a lot too!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Xiangling and Guoba!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 27.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Thank you for the trouble, there was no need to...
:{{DIcon}} Ahem...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 28.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...I'll take them. Thank you... and Guoba too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 16.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' You're welcome!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 17.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, the Almond Tofu I made probably tastes and feels a little different from the type Yanxiao cooks. Please let me know if there's any improvements I should make!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiao 29.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 18.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hehe, that's all!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 2 talk xiangling 19.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Alrighty, we should head back now. We can't keep Paimon waiting!

:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your dessert is all Paimon's!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Sorry to keep everyone waiting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' No worries, we're all just chatting here. There's no serious business to take care of.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Whether we're chatting outside or inside, it's all the same.
:{{DIcon}} Strive to be more like Hu Tao, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, Paimon's too busy eating to talk to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' But even though we're all well-acquainted by now, I think this festive gathering deserves something ceremonious.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh? Is this some local custom?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Nope.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' This is something I made up so that good luck will be on our side, that's all!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Spontaneity is the best choice to make here! Um, let's use this incense burner on the table.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's been lit for so long now that the incense is running out. I'll leave refilling and lighting the incense to the most distinguished guest among us all.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Lighting the incense will signify continuous growth and prosperity in all our endeavors in the new year!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I see. Perfect symbolism, as expected of Hu Tao!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' And speaking of the most distinguished guest here today... I'm sure we all agree that it's Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I'm not very familiar with the details of his past deeds, but chatting with him has been a real eye-opener, even for a bard who has traveled all across the world.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' If knowledge were a form of power, one could even say that you're a wielder of unlimited strength!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But when it comes to having a way with words, the notable bard is certainly one cut above the rest.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I just happen to have a good memory. It is such an unexceptional skill, yet you made it sound like an unparalleled talent. I am truly impressed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Since we all get to nominate someone...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Mm-hmm.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I think it's only fair that we let the parlor director light the incense.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Huh, that won't do! Don't flatter me just because I'm your boss!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' We are looking for the most distinguished guest here. As the host, I shouldn't be involved in this discussion at all!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Now that we've enjoyed this tableful of delicacies, how about we let our one and only chef here do the honors?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Um, is this really the way this works? I didn't cook any of these dishes!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's not a big deal!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 13.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Just look at her! Xiangling, the disciple of an adeptus, the Stove God's best companion, the winner of the Masterful Chefs competition.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 14.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' The only heir of the famous Wanmin Restaurant, a good old friend of mine. There's no better choice!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, why does Paimon feel like we're back at square one again?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' P&mdash;Please, stop! You're making me embarrassed!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' If we're looking for a distinguished guest... surely the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild counts? It's one of the largest commerce guilds in Liyue Harbor!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Eh, don't get me involved in this!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 15.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oooh, not a bad choice. With the commerce guild's young master lighting the incense, we're all sure to make a huge sum of Mora in the new year.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' That's not how it works!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Making a fortune is indeed a fine wish, but it's of lesser importance than good health and happiness.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Which means we should choose Chongyun, the skilled exorcist who keeps everyone's home safe from evil spirits.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Huh? Now you're nominating me?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I can't be the one when we have the Conqueror of Demons right here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Adeptus Xiao has the most seniority among everyone here today. We should...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I refuse.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I am most certainly not the most distinguished guest here.
:{{DIcon}} (Is he going to say it's Zhongli...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You should all be able to make the right judgment based on your observations.
:{{DIcon}} (Wait, don't...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' One person here is well-acquainted with everyone else.
:{{DIcon}} (...Hm?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's right!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even though you're always mocking Paimon, you're still pretty popular with other people!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, wait! Paimon said she wouldn't talk to you again...
:{{DIcon}} I'm not the only well-connected person here though.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Who else is there?
:{{DIcon}} You, of course.
:{{DIcon}} Take a look in the mirror.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Huh!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that mean... Paimon's the most distinguished guest?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that was unexpected, ehehe...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I agree. Paimon's just the one we need.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Without a friend constantly by your side, a long journey would become dreadfully lonesome.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But once you have someone there to brighten up the atmosphere, everything along the way will become lively and vibrant too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' (Traveler) has traversed many nations and left behind a great deal of fascinating stories. But without Paimon, they would've become quite monotonous.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Paimon plays an indispensable role in making your journey a happy and smooth one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You guys, Paimon's not used to being praised like that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, those were genuine compliments, right?
:{{DIcon}} Of course. You're the best travel companion ever!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thank you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You made Paimon wait for a long time, but Paimon's not mad anymore!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Don't take everything to heart, Paimon. Friends tease each other all the time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm... That is indeed true.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' That means Paimon is as important to (Traveler) as Guoba is to me!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 16.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Looks like we've come to an agreement! Any objections before we proceed?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I trust (Traveler)'s judgment.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 17.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Then Paimon it is!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 18.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' And now, the world's most excellent traveler's greatest companion, guide, and friend &mdash; Paimon! &mdash; will be refilling and lighting the incense for us!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 3 talk hutao 19.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Here you go, take the match... and don't burn yourself! But if things go really wrong, here's a two for one coupon.

:'''Amidst everyone's laughter and applause, Paimon clumsily lights the incense...'''

:'''You all have a relaxed heart-to-heart chat all the way until nightfall.'''

:'''Now that everyone's had their fill of delicious food and tea, it's time to say goodbye.'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's getting late. I won't take up any more of your time. You're all free to go as you please.
:{{DIcon}} The food and desserts were delicious.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the treat, Director.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! The tea was amazing, too!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You don't have to go all polite on me. Just remember to come when I invite you next time!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hmm... Let's see...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's dark out, so I'm going to accompany Xiangling, Xingqiu, and Chongyun back home. As for the rest of the guests, I'll leave them to our consultant.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' No need. I'm headed towards the harbor to meet a friend on the ship. There's no need to trouble one such as Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I think you know the place I'm talking about. Come meet me anytime!
:{{DIcon}} I will.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It was great getting to know you all. Let's meet again when the spring breeze begins to blow!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Bye! We should write poetry together sometime!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' We'll catch you all later then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Don't forget to return to the parlor later. There's something I need you to do!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Understood. See you later.
:{{DIcon}} Bye!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Well then...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Rex Lapis...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Just Zhongli will do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I live as a mortal in Liyue Harbor now. I am just one among many who begin work at sunrise, and retire to rest at sundown.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If we were to consider status and seniority, as Zhongli, I should be respectfully referring to you as Adeptus Xiao.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Heaven forbid!
:{{DIcon}} Adeptus Xiao!
::{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 03a 1.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Not you too!
:{{DIcon}} Let's stop teasing him now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha, I meant what I said.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I heard that during the Lantern Rite music festival, you conferred with [[Streetward Rambler]] and [[Cloud Retainer]]. I take it as you've gained a lot more knowledge about the past?
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The same truth will sound different coming from different people. As more bear witness to a story, feelings and interpretations expand in variety too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I once had a pleasant chat about the past and present with a Sumeru scholar named [[Soraya]], and learned a few things about her research topic.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' From the evidence she found and the conclusions she made, her area of research is already very close to the truth.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But there are multiple sides to humans and gods alike.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In the legends recorded by humans, some gods were depicted as arrogant and condescending, while others were kind and capable.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But whether to me, Streetward Rambler, Cloud Retainer, or younger adepti such as Xiao and Ganyu, those adepti and gods that may seem extraordinary to humans are something more akin to close companions.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This was as true back then as it is right now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Just as Xiao may seem unapproachable to most, but (Traveler) has proved otherwise.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' So there's no need to dwell too much on certain things.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Rex La&mdash; I mean, Zhongli, what you're saying is...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It looks like you understood what I meant.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The director asked me to accompany you on your return, but I don't think you'll need my protection. I'll be taking a walk around and admiring the night scenery.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' After that... it'll be time for me to go back and meet up with the director. Goodbye for now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bye, Zhongli!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Everyone's gone now...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon always feels a little empty inside when a lively celebration ends...
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But at least you'll always stay by Paimon's side!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No no no, Paimon got it mixed up! Paimon, the best and most distinguished travel guide, will always stay by your side, (Traveler)!
:{{DIcon}} It's my honor.
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid there'll be a lot to ask of you in the future too, most distinguished Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, good that you're aware of that!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiao, is there anything else you wanna do? We could take you on a tour of Liyue Harbor!
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' No need.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I've stayed here for much longer than I had expected. The city lights are a fine sight... but it's time for me to leave.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The events of today occurred so abruptly. I appreciate your kindness.
:{{DIcon}} The feeling's mutual. You don't have to thank me every time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo eqhdj201 4 talk xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I'll... see you next time, then.

===Beidou and Ningguang===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Beidou or Ningguang at the Yujing Terrace)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hey, don't tell me you called me over just for a game of chess.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You have to be more specific, Captain Beidou.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Is it that you find playing chess an uninteresting activity, or that you're unhappy about my lack of novel ideas?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' If you don't specify what you mean, how could I know what I should do to please you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Heh, of course...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I make a single remark and you reply with a full-blown lecture.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Maybe we should deal with all official affairs publicly in the future. Might just make things easier.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I'd be perfectly happy with that &mdash; I'm just worried that Captain Beidou's business might be negatively affected.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Don't give me that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' That woman from Yanshang Teahouse sometimes comes aboard to ask for information. She requested the fleet to import some goods, but how could I not know who she's actually working for?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Oh? You sure know a lot, Captain Beidou.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' How about I ask her to come over? Or maybe we go straight to her Teahouse?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' With one more person around, we'll be able to have some variety in our chess games. I hope that that would be less of a bore to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk beidou 07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Tsk, so we're still going to play chess after all!

===Zhongli and Guoba===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Zhongli or Guoba at Wanmin Restaurant)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The vegetables are fresh, and there are enough wheats and grains stocked up... I'll pass on the seafood.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh, it's you. We meet again.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Surprised to see me here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It's the director's orders. Xiangling worked all day and night at the restaurant during the festival and didn't get to have any time to enjoy the festivities. The director sent me here to help out in the kitchen so that Xiangling will have some time to herself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But with someone as hardworking as you around, there seems to be nothing much for me to do...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk gooba 01.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪~
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It feels good seeing my old friend in the kitchen fetching ingredients and lighting fires.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Perhaps I should borrow Cloud Retainer's supreme cuisine machine to speed things up...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk gooba 02.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' !
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...You'd still prefer to make them by hand? But of course.

===Hu Tao, Xingqiu, Xiangling, and Chongyun===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Hu Tao, Xingqiu, Xiangling, or Chongyun at the Dockyard)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, Xingqiu, you have to be honest.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hm? Honest about what?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' How did you and Venti really meet?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' W—Why are you suddenly asking that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Eh? Aren't they book buddies?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Yeah! We met a few times at a book convention, that's all...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ohh? Really?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' With that extraordinary demeanor and literary talent, he's definitely not just any bard.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' If he's someone that could hold his ground in a conversation with the consultant, he needs to at least be as talented as me!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Um, perhaps you're overthinking this matter...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hu Tao, Xingqiu wouldn't lie to us...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:'''*sigh* Okay, I'll tell you the truth.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Xingqiu...!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I'm actually a fan of Venti's poetry.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' You all know that I love reading, and sometimes come across poetry from Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Among those works, I admire the ones penned by Venti the most. Just as Hu Tao said, his artistry is the reflection of his personality — remarkable grace and exceptional literary talent.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I guess Venti didn't tell you the whole truth back at the restaurant because he didn't want to embarrass me in front of everyone... He's such a considerate person.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...Yes, right. I can confirm that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' When Xingqiu was busy with other things, he asked me to buy him poetry books in secret.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I see...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' That didn't sound like too much of a big deal. You could've told us right away.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Well, I'm telling you now, aren't I?

:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' ...Ah, forget it. Let's drop this topic.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's not often that the four of us are all together. What should we do next? Hide-and-seek, hopscotch, or some shopping?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Since there's four of us... Why don't we borrow a mahjong set?

===Venti and Kaedehara Kazuha===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Kazuha or Venti aboard the Alcor)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' This is such a cool ship!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Facing the sea breeze and gazing out at the soaring seagulls... Ah, makes me wanna sing out loud!
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Kazuha, how about I stay here and be the ship's resident bard? What are my prospects?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' With your level of artistic finesse, I'm sure nothing will go wrong.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But I'm afraid the sailors aboard are not the most versed in the arts. They probably wouldn't understand the deeper meaning your poetry holds.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, you can't say that for sure! Poetry is spur-of-the-moment creations. Anyone viewing the same sights and experiencing the same atmosphere would surely understand.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' *sigh* There's a [[Dornman Port|port in Mondstadt]] too, but I rarely get the chance to board any of the ships.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Speaking of ships, everything's perfect about this one, except...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Um, Kazuha...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Could you tell your Captain that my height says nothing of my age? I'm way past drinking age.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' How often does one get to enjoy a seafood feast on a ship? It'll be a real shame if there isn't anything stronger to enhance the food! Pretty please?
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' There's... not much I can do about that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It's not because Captain Beidou's not on the ship right now, but because there's no room for negotiation on this matter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Even I have to sit in the no-drinking zone every time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' *whimper* But I don't get drunk after just a few sips... Trust me, I can hold my liquor really well!

===Xiao===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Xiao at Wangshu Inn)
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Yanxiao just came up here with some Almond Tofu, but... I haven't finished everything Xiangling gave me yet...
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You should try some too. I'm not as experienced in tasting mortal food as you, and I couldn't tell the difference.
:{{A|vo eqhdj202 talk xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...There must be many different stories to tell of the hustle and bustle of the mortal world, too. You can tell me. I will listen.

==Trivia==
* Some character will not be present during their post-quest dialogue if their story quest or hangout event are active. Their post-dialogue lines will still be played. This happens to Hu Tao and Chongyun.
** However, some character will be present during their post-quest dialogue even though their story quest or hangout event are active. This happens to Xingqiu.
{{verify|How about the rest except Baizhu and Qiqi? Also, Zhongli has two story quests. Are both of his story quests affecting the same way?}}
