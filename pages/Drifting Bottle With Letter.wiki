'''Drifting Bottle With Letter''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained when [[fishing]] at a specific location during the [[Lunar Realm]] event, and will directly be added into the player's [[inventory]] upon successfully catching a fish.

Despite [[Paimon]] stating during the {{Quest|Over the Moon}} that it is used to write new wishes inside, the bottle is not removed from the player's [[inventory]] and remains there even after the event is concluded.

==Location==
The fishing spot is located under the [[File:UI MarkPoint MoonfinTrial Challenge.png|20px]] icon on the island to the west of [[Kujou Encampment]], [[Kannazuka]], [[Inazuma]].

==Text==
Father! Mother! Forgive me! Forgive your unfilial child!

How blinded I was by the legend of that [[Lunar Leviathan]]! To think that I believed that catching some crummy fish would fetch me a rich man's daughter for a wife! Well, there's no getting off this boat now, is there?

I have no clue how long we've been drifting out on open sea. There's nothing to drink, and I haven't the strength to catch any fish.

We can't see the other end of this accursed sea. I swear, this will be the end of me, [[Jiawei]]!

...I mean, this really is it, isn't it? Ah...

If this thrice-be-darned Lunar Leviathan has any heart at all, let it carry my letter to the shore.

Please stop waiting for me, Father, Mother. I'm not getting out of this one.

If I should ever be reborn, I swear that I will marry a wealthy lady and wait on the two of you for the rest of my days!

Marry a hawk, and the sky's your hunting ground.

Marry a dog, and the earth's your... Err... Actually, how did that saying go again...

(Various scribbles of varying depth follow. None of them make any sense, however.)
