Well, to think of it, I guess you feel pretty fulfilled when staying so busy.

I'm the same way! I pray to the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]], listen to the prayers of others, heal the sick, and practice my singing every day...

Speaking of singing, I just learned a new special song.

Although it is not my usual style, I find the melody to be particularly comforting, as if it is overflowing with warm emotions...I think you will like it too.

Oh yes, I sent you some [[Dandelion Seed|dandelion seeds]] with the letter. I hope you can come listen to my new song when you are free.

Hehe, that would be my birthday wish.
