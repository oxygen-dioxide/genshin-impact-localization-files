'''Wind Gliders''' are the primary tool that players use for [[Gliding]] in mid-air through open terrain in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. Wind Gliders can be changed for each individual [[Character]] in the [[Dressing Room]]. This customization is purely aesthetic and has no impact on gameplay.

==Usage==
{{Main|Gliding}}
While gliding is another [[stamina]]-consuming activity, it does not cost as much stamina as [[sprinting]], and is comparable to that of regular [[swimming]]. The utilization of gliders varies &mdash; often, deploying the glider can negate user [[Fall Damage]] from any height (unless the player opts out of gliding in mid-air). Gliders are also used to be able to reach high areas that neither normally jumping or climbing would achieve.

==Story==
When the [[Traveler]] first enters the city of [[Mondstadt]] and heads up to the fountain area, they are greeted with the unlocking of the wind glider by [[Amber]]. A short quick-time tutorial is given to the player to help them learn the controls of a glider.

It is not until the quest "[[Glide With the Wind]]," that Amber tells the player they cannot glide (in [[Mondstadt]], at least) without a gliding license. Regardless if the quest is done or not, however, it does not restrict the player from using a glider in any area of the game.

During the event Story Quest, "[[Where Ancient Stars Align]]," it was later revealed that the inventor and designer of the Wind Glider was a retired adventurer by the name of [[Leonard]], who lived two thousand years ago.

==Trivia==
* Players can use the Wind Glider before unlocking it from the {{Quest|City of Freedom}} by ejecting from a [[Waverider]] or using a [[Thunder Sphere]].
** The glider used appears to be [[Wings of First Flight]].
** Due to the limited map area before completion of ''[[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]]'', both methods require players to use other players' worlds, which is only possible after unlocking [[Co-Op Mode]] at [[Adventure Rank]] 16.
** It was possible to use the Wind Glider in single-player mode in Version 1.6 after the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event ended, as all players who reached [[Adventure Rank]] 21 could reach the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]], which had [[Waverider Waypoint]]s.
* According to Amber, many people who are new to using gliders will learn to fly in [[Springvale]], since the buildings only have two or three floors.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Amber|Idyllic Town}}</ref>
