|text    = I like to observe what's around me and take inspiration from them for my dance steps.

The rolling waves, a fluttering [[Crystalfly]]... All these beautiful things that are within reach, I wish to express their brilliance through dance.

However, after observing the landscapes of [[Sumeru]] for so long, I'm running out of inspiration...

Maybe it's time to learn from the [[Shaggy Sumpter Beast]]s and pack enough supplies to venture further?

Ah, I know, I can go to the desert!

The last time I danced at the [[Sobek Oasis|oasis]], creative ideas kept popping into my head. I'm sure I'll find something new if I go back!

Let me gather some friends! We can admire the dunes together, go stargazing, and sing around the bonfire! How does that sound?
