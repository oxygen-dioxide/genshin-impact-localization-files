:'''Jacquetta:''' I don't get it. Don't those two leaders sit in the same office &mdash; in fact, don't they sit at adjoining tables? Why are their views different?
:'''Isadora:''' It might be a communication issue...
:'''Jacquetta:''' And every time I try to get a signature, if they aren't both missing, then one will ask me to get a second opinion from the other. I mean, would it kill them to get their story straight first!?
:'''Isadora:''' Then maybe they don't have a good relationship...
;(If {{Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}} has not been completed)
::'''Jacquetta:''' Also, more and more people are growing dissatisfied with the Palais's inaction regarding the "prophecy." One of the construction teams has even gone on strike...
::'''Jacquetta:''' I mean, prophecies can't really be verified &mdash; we've got more practical problems to deal with!
::{{sic|'''Jacquetta:'''}} Yeah, that's true...
;(If Masquerade of the Guilty has been completed)
::'''Jacquetta:''' There's been a lot of work to do regarding rebuilding and repairing the flood damage lately.
::'''Jacquetta:''' The excitement of not having been dissolved didn't last long, and now a pile of other problems have surfaced that need to be dealt with...
::'''Isadora:''' Yeah, that's true...
