{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After submitting all Venue Decorations)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 1 dvorak 01.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Thank you both so much! At last, everything on the list is done.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 1 dvorak 02.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' I'm afraid I still have some final preparations to make, but I'll see you tomorrow. Then, the party can begin!

;(Talk to Dvorak, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 dvorak 07.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' I still have some final preparations to make for the big party.

;(Approach the venue after passing time)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Compadres, you're here! Hey, serious props to you both. The place looks amazing, even better than I imagined! Hahahahaha!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 shinobu 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Everything looks perfect. We're ready for business. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, you have our thanks.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guys, guys... why so serious? That ain't rock 'n' roll, man.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, look at that! My favorite melon's a fast learner! Also, I hear you're gonna be taking the stage tonight! Itching for a little competition, huh?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Paimon was just joking! ...Gah, seriously, Dvorak? Unbelievable...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Getting cold feet? Don't blame you. I am the reigning champion of The Great Singalong, after all.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, Paimon. Backing down from a challenge ain't very rock 'n' roll.
::{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What&mdash; Paimon is too rock 'n' roll! Paimon was just being humble!
:{{DIcon}} Come on, Paimon. You can beat Itto!
::{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, ya think so? 'Cause Paimon totally thinks so too.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Then bring it on.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon's bringin' it alright! Paimon's bringin' it all the way home! Hmph!
:{{DIcon}} Oh by the way &mdash; did you ever find that dog?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' ...We hit a complete dead-end. Gorou said he didn't know anything, Mamoru and the guys asked around the city, but no luck there either.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' What if it really IS in Tenshukaku? Is that why we can't find it?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, don't go poking around Tenshukaku again... You'll give Kujou Sara a migraine.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Couldn't agree more. If I bother her too much, I'll end up getting struck by lightning...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' So that's why this time, I kept my distance and just threw some paper notes towards Tenshukaku. Hopefully, the Raiden Shogun sees them and hands the dog over.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what? You're still taking a big risk there...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 shinobu 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' It looks like Doushin Shikanoin was right. It's probably just a local legend after all.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Let's hope not, 'cause that would really suck! Wish I had more time to look into it, but unfortunately &mdash; this guy's got a performance to practice for.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Now don't forget, there's lyrics and music scores in the Jam Zone. So no wussing out tonight!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't get too cocky, Bull-Chucker! We'll see who's rock 'n' roll!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 itto 11.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahahahaha! Game on, Mini Melon!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon better get some practice in at the Jam Zone soon. No way is Paimon gonna lose to Itto!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 shinobu 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' By the way, we invited a ton of people this time, including some people you know. A few have already shown up, and they're asking about you &mdash; wanna go say hi?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool! Yeah, let's go see them! Paimon's curious to find out who you invited.
----
;(Talk to Kuki Shinobu, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 shinobu 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Hey {{Traveler}}. Some of your friends are here, wanna go say hi?

;(Talk to Sangonomiya Kokomi or Gorou)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' This Ms. Hina looks very familiar... Even the outfit...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I was thinking the same thing, Your Excellency. But I just can't put my finger on it...
:{{Introductory Note|Gorou}}
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' She really is the spitting image...
:{{Introductory Note|Sangonomiya Kokomi}}
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Of who?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gorou! Kokomi! Hey!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Ah, hello, you two! It's been a while!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe, I'm so happy to see you again. I was just asking Shinobu if she knew where you were.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is a nice surprise. Paimon didn't expect to run into you two at an Arataki Gang music festival!
:{{DIcon}} I hear that Gorou helped to secure the venue?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 04.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Oh, I barely did anything.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 05.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' A reader from my That's Life column was asking for advice about it, so I figured I'd help out. Turned out the reader in question was Mr. Arataki Itto.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 06.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Her Excellency was also very supportive of the whole thing.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Mm... An international rock 'n' roll music festival sounded like a good way to attract tourists. And it's to bring attention to the plight of living things, right? Seems like a meaningful cause.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. Apparently, it has something to do with a dog that was a war hero? Although sadly, probably not a true story. Have either of you... heard anything about that...?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, you know, bits and pieces... Nothing concrete.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 07.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Mm... Yeah, no, me neither.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, those sounded suspiciously like prepared answers!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe, probably because we've answered that question before. Mr. Arataki Itto came to ask us about it a while back. We'd certainly love to help, if we can.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 08.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Yes, of course... Um, ahem, actually, I was hoping to ask for your opinion on something.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, what is it?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 09.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Does Ms. Hina look familiar to you at all? I have this strange feeling like I've seen her somewhere before...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Umm...
:{{DIcon}} I feel like I've met her before... but...
::{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 10a 1.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' But you don't remember where?
:{{DIcon}} ...Nope, sorry. Doesn't ring any bells.
::{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 10b 1.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hmm. Maybe it's just me...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 06b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, she probably just looks similar to someone you know. Like how {{Traveler}} looks similar to {{MC|m=his sister|f=her brother}}! There's no mystery here. Don't overthink it.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 gorou 11.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I see... That does make sense...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, let's get outta here...

;(Talk to Gorou or Sangonomiya Kokomi, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Who could it be...?
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe...

;(Talk to Yoimiya or Thoma)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' You're a real trooper, Yoimiya! This must be one of the furthest places you've ever delivered to.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I promised Itto that I'd supply fireworks for his festival. I wasn't about to go back on my word.
:{{Introductory Note|Yoimiya}}
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Thoma, Yoimiya!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! Cool, you're here too!
:{{DIcon}} It's been too long!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, looks I owe the Arataki Gang a huge thank-you. If they weren't putting on this event, who knows when I would've gotten to see you next.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' You hear that? In case it was too subtle for you &mdash; Thoma's complaining that you guys never make time to come and visit your old pals.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' That's true. Obviously, traveling's very important to you, but you gotta take a break every once in a while. Just remember that you've got friends out there who'd love nothing more than the chance to make you feel looked after.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you both. That means a lot.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Of course! Ooh, I heard this really cool thing, I gotta share with you guys.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' So Itto says that the theme of this music festival comes from a story about a dog that saved animals in the warzone. How amazing is that!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' What do you know about this dog, Thoma? Everyone knows how well-connected you are.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Heh, for once... not much, I'm afraid. I guess my connections are one key canine short.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 05.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' But assuming this really happened, I feel like Watatsumi Island would've had to be involved.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 06.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' This is a dog who managed to sneak in and out of a warzone, repeatedly, without leaving a trail for anyone to follow. Whatever the case, it would've needed someone to help cover its tracks.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 07.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' As far as I know, the Shogun's Army doesn't do that kind of thing.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're saying it was the Sangonomiya troops? They had a specially trained dog for rescuing critters from the battlefield?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Sounds kinda far-fetched if you ask me... Do we really think Sangonomiya's forces had enough manpower to fight a full-scale war and run a... what, a canine wildlife rescue operation on the side?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, well if wasn't Sangonomiya's side, it must have been the Shogunate!
:{{DIcon}} I doubt they had the manpower either...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 08.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Right. So in my view, it's more likely that Mr. Dvorak simply made the story up as something to capture people's imaginations.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 thoma 09.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I mean, he's an artist, right? Isn't rock music about expressing things we don't fully understand?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Kinda like fireworks, in a way. Don't question it, just feel it...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Yeah, that sort of makes sense. That makes you an artist too, Yoimiya! Fireworks are your art.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 4 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Heehee, I'll take it! And on that note &mdash; boy, do I have an art show for you tonight! Make sure you don't miss it!

;(Talk to Yoimiya or Thoma again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Sounds like you know a few things about art yourself, Thoma.
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Art? Me? ...Does knitting sweaters count?
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Absolutely! Knitting is totally an art form!
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Just... not a very rock 'n' roll one, I guess. I don't think I'll be doing any knitting tonight.
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Not with that attitude! You could, uh... knit sweaters with "Rock 'N' Roll" in big letters! Then get everyone to wear them!
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hmm, good idea! I'll look into it next time.

;(Talk to Shikanoin Heizou)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 01.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Hey, there you are! I sent you some letters a few days ago, have they shown up yet?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooooh! Does this mean you've figured it out?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 02.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I've made some progress, but I'm still missing the final piece of the puzzle.
:{{DIcon}} So. What did you learn?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 03.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I don't have anything conclusive yet, but I have a hunch that it involved both the Yashiro Commission and Sangonomiya.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? You mean like... in cahoots? During the war!?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 04.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Shhh... Like I said, it's just a hunch. Let's not get carried away.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 05.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Anyway, I've written to the station, and they shouldn't take too long to get back to me. Yoriki [[Owada]] should be able to help find what I need.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 06.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' In the meantime, you'll just have to be patient.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 07.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I would have gone back to the station to look into it myself, but I knew Itto was performing tonight and I didn't wanna miss it.
:{{DIcon}} You know who else is performing tonight? Paimon!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 08.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Oh, wow! Sounds like I'm in for a real treat. I definitely picked the right place to be tonight.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 09.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Will the Traveler's long-serving "Voice" finally graduate from speech to song in a triumphant victory over the oni rocker of Hanamizaka?
:{{DIcon}} They don't call her "Flying Rock 'N' Roll Fuel" for nothing.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 heizou 10.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Hahahaha! I'll be awaiting with bated breath!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cut it out, both of you! No more stupid nicknames!

;(Talk to Shikanoin Heizou, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yyeq002 heizou 01.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Hmm, what if Madam Kujou Sara's the one who got my letter... No, surely she wouldn't intentionally ignore it?

;(After talking with everyone)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't realize so many people we know would be here. Better get practicing, or tonight could be super embarrassing.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's head to the Jam Zone.
----
;(Talk to Dvorak)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Mr. Dvorak! You're still here.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 01.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Sure am. I've been checking over the equipment, scores, and lyric sheets to make sure everything's ready for tonight.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 02.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Shinobu was telling me how popular light novels are here in Inazuma. So I've tweaked the melody and lyrics for a more Arataki Gang feel with a light novel twist.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Light novels plus rock music, so... light rock!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 03.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Hahaha. I actually didn't change too much &mdash; just took out the dog and made it about Onikabuto instead. Should be more up Itto's alley.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 04.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' This event couldn't have happened without him. It's my way of showing him some appreciation, I guess.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whaaat? You got rid of the dog? But... wasn't that the whole inspiration behind the festival?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 05.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Yes, but that's all it was. The initial inspiration. Doesn't matter if we change it to an Onikabuto, or you, or me, or anything else. It's the spirit of it that counts.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Spirit? What do you mean?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 06.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Umm... The spirit of rock 'n' roll?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Okay, shoulda seen that coming.
:{{DIcon}} Do you think people have been getting too hyper-focused on the dog story?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 07.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Hehe, it's all about the music, my friends. Just enjoy the music, that's all that matters.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fair enough... Alright, well speaking of enjoying music, is it alright if Paimon goes first?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gotta get practicing, or Bull-Chucker's gonna hog the spotlight tonight!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 08.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' By all means, be my guest! I knew you'd come around to the idea of going on stage.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 09.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Here's the music score and lyrics. I can't wait to see this!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, let's see now, what's this song called...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "I Got Reincarnated as an Onikabuto... And Flipped the World Upside Down"...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What sort of song title is that? Is this supposed to be rock 'n' roll?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 10.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Soft rock, actually.
:{{DIcon}} I gotta see these lyrics...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, no peeking, {{Traveler}}! You can hear them tonight when Paimon sings the song!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna rock so hard, Bull-Chucker won't know what hit him!
:{{Black Screen|The time flies by, and night soon falls...}}
:{{Black Screen|Music lovers take turns showcasing their talent on the stage.}}
:{{Black Screen|Whoops and cheers ring out as the crowd grows louder and the atmosphere gets wilder.}}
:{{Black Screen|Before you know it, the moment has arrived.}}
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 11.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Ladies and gentlemen!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 12.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Tonight is a night to celebrate, and I trust you're all having a wonderful time!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 13.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' It's been a non-stop rock 'n' roll ride this evening, and we're almost at the end. But first, it is my huge honor to invite two very special guests to the stage...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 14.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' The illustrious Mr. Arataki Itto!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 15.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' And Ms. Paimon!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 16.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' The two of them will be performing a brand-new song written specially for tonight's event. It's called:
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 17.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' "I Got Reincarnated as an Onikabuto... And Flipped the World Upside Down"!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 7 dvorak 18.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Take it away!

:{{Black Screen|After an exhilarating song to end the night, many people begin to leave...}}
:{{Black Screen|But you and your friends approach the stage to congratulate the two rockstars...}}
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' So that's rock music, huh? It's a little different than I imagined.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Really? It's different from what I'd heard before... Could be a relatively new genre of rock, I suppose.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' So, how'd you like my performance? Did I dominate this lil' melon here or what? Hahahahaha!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, Bull-chucker! You got owned and you know it!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, stop it, you two. I think both of you were sensational!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hear, hear! Really mind-blowing stuff, guys.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 shinobu 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' I call it a draw. You're very evenly matched.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, you think? Okay, well what about you, my compadre? Who do you think is the most rock 'n' roll?
:{{DIcon}} Itto.
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 03a 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahahahaha! That's right, compadre you tell 'em. Behold the majesty of the Rock 'N' Roll King of Hanamizaka!
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh! Traitor! That's it, Paimon's not talking to you for the next minute!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon.
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 02b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehehe, {{Traveler}}'s always got Paimon's back! Take that, Bull-Chucker! Hah!
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 03b 1a.ogg}} {{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 03b 1b.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Huh? Oh, my gullible little melon. You don't really believe that do you? {{MC|m=He|f=She}} just didn't wanna hurt your feelings!
:{{DIcon}} You're both rockstars.
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 02c 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Really? Do you really think that?
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 03c 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, fine... My compadre wouldn't lie to me. I can handle the truth...
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 03c 2.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' *sigh*... Rock on, Mini Melon... Rock on.
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, what nice weather we've been having lately!
::{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 03d 1.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, don't try to change the subject!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 dvorak 01.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Haha, let's not argue anymore, shall we? Itto and Paimon, you both gave incredibly moving performances...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 dvorak 02.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' I owe you all an enormous debt of gratitude. Without your help, this music festival never would've happened.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Don't mention it, Jack-Attack! Hey, if we hadn't met, I wouldn't even know what the spirit of rock 'n' roll means!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' The spirit of rock 'n' roll? So, what does it mean? What does it mean for rock music to have a "spirit"?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' It means you rock up, rock out, roll the dice, and roll with the punches! Just like me and Paimon!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's obviously not what it means... Mr. Dvorak, could you please give us the official definition? Someone needs to take this guy down a peg.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 dvorak 03.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Hehe, an official definition? I don't know that one exists... It's an emotional experience. As though you're hearing your own story speak to you through the music.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Funny you should say that... I was just thinking that the spirit of rock 'n' roll is... well, like the Onikabuto in the song: Having the courage to grab life by the horns and survive against all the odds.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 thoma 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Guess I have a better sense rock 'n' roll than I thought! Haha.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about you, Yoimiya?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, well... I thought it was gonna be all about that dog, but then the song didn't even mention it, so...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Was that supposed to be symbolic...? Like, if the dog didn't exist, maybe the injured animals didn't, either...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' If there were no injured animals, that means there was no war, which means... the world is at peace.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So for Yoimiya, the rock 'n' roll spirit is all about world peace!
:{{DIcon}} Shinobu? What about you?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 shinobu 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Me? Uh, I hadn't given it all that much thought. I was mostly worrying about whether those paper notes Boss threw into Tenshukaku are going to get him in trouble with the Tenryou Commission...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 thoma 05.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha! That must mean that for Shinobu, the rock 'n' roll spirit is about keeping the Arataki Gang safe.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Shinobu, seriously, you've got nothing to worry about. If the Raiden Shogun had seen any of those notes, she'd have come to join the party!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon agrees that you don't need to worry. Otherwise, Heizou definitely would've arrested Itto by now!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Where is that guy, anyway? And where did Kokomi and Gorou go?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 shinobu 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Oh, Doushin Shikanoin had to run back to the station, so he didn't get the chance to say goodbye to you guys. But he did leave something for you. It's over there.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 shinobu 04.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' As for the other two, they couldn't stick around because they had a government meeting to get to. They did ask me to pass on their regards, though.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 dvorak 04.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' The fact that these busy people all made time to attend the party is telling. Clearly, Itto wasn't exaggerating about the stature of the Arataki Gang.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 dvorak 05.ogg}} '''Dvorak:''' Itto, what can I say... It's truly been an honor to work with you.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahahahaha! Well, Jack-Attack, I can't take all the credit &mdash; let's not forget {{Traveler}}'s part in all this!
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 08a.ogg}} {{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 08b.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' A lot of people only showed up because they knew {{MC|m=he'd|f=she'd}} be here. If we do this again, we gotta make sure we find a way to get {{MC|m=him|f=her}} on stage.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 8 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' How's that sound, compadre? Get that rock 'n' roll spirit ready, 'cause next time, it'll be your turn to rock our collective socks off!

;(In the field just east of the event venue)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Your Excellency, I believe the Tenryou Commission detective has&mdash;
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't worry about it, Gorou. The Puppy Union was a joint venture between us and the Yashiro Commission. If we can maintain secrecy, then all the better for it. But that was never the main goal.
:;(A dog resembling the one from Gorou's talents wanders by)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' We saved some lives, and that's what matters.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I was more worried about the potential impact on your reputation, Your Excellency... After all, some of the lives we saved belonged to the Shogunate...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' If someone with an agenda finds out, it could cause an uproar...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't worry. There might be a way to make it work out in our favor.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 gorou 04.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Really? How?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Times have changed. We and Narukami Island are supposed to be working together now.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' So it's not necessarily a bad thing if people discover that we were already cooperating with the Yashiro Commission even during the war.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 gorou 05.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I see...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Gorou, if you want my opinion, you should be more concerned about Ms. Hina than you are about this.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 gorou 06.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Ms. Hina? What makes you say that?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I hear she works for That's Life magazine as well. She's young, popular, pretty...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' And she seems to be just as good at offering comfort to people in need as you are. So it looks like you have some competition.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 9 gorou 07.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Ahem... Understood, Your Excellency! I will work hard to stay ahead of the competition!
----<!-- Scene transition -->
;(On the cliff overlooking the event venue)
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' I learned something new today... I never knew that the Hydro nation's rock music had the power to stir up lightning.
:{{Introductory Note|Yae Miko}}
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Miko... A few days ago, some strange paper notes flew into Tenshukaku, demanding that I "hand over the dog"... So I am here to see what on earth it was all about.
:{{Introductory Note|Raiden Shogun}}
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Haha, I just assumed you must've gotten yourself a pet puppy.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' As it happens, I also received an invitation letter via Sara.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I've never heard the name "Arataki" before... But they must be one of my subjects, and so I thought, why not grant them their wish?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Ah... so you came here to make a little oni's wish come true, hmm?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 04.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' So tell me, how do you plan to respond to the Fontainian musician? It sounded to me like his music was commenting on the war...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' The war...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I'm not sure we can give him the answer he would hope for.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' But if nothing else, I know that we must avoid another war at all costs. The people cannot be made to suffer like that again.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 05.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 06.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' But what if the bigger war comes to pass? What then?
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' If it cannot be avoided, then...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...I will have no choice but to fight.
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 07.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Well, if that day comes...
:{{A|vo yyeq002 12 yaemiko 08.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' I'm sure that everyone here tonight will fight by your side.
