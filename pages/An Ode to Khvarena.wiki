==Text==
O [[Nagarjuna]],<br>
Aided by [[Khvarena]] in its countless forms, I bless this land of eternal calamity.<br>
When the sludge of the deepest depths of the [[abyss]] stained the first kingdom,<br>
The [[Simurgh|glorious Khvarena]] that aided the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Lord of Wisdom]] was scattered in endless forms.<br>
I crossed back over the River of Sorrow, and of the [[Amrita]] I drank.<br>
I opened a path for the benevolent spirits so that the merciful light of wisdom may illuminate the four corners.

O Nagarjuna,<br>
Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I nourish the benevolent spirits in the sea of flowers.<br>
Behold, soul illuminated by Khvarena, final descendant of the god of grass and trees.<br>
Behold, heroes who battle the [[cataclysm]] endlessly, foes of the Dev.<br>
For not even the inky gloom from beyond the skies shall erode their forms.

O Nagarjuna,<br>
Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have transcended the dead of this foul earth.<br>
Cleanse the sinless of their sins, so that they may be reborn in a pure land free of suffering.<br>
In the chakras of the earth are contained the karmic seeds that will give birth to all things.<br>
The fleeting blights and glories of the earthly realm are naught but the illusion of existing seeds.

O Nagarjuna,<br>
Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have cleansed the abyss of heaven above.<br>
The sludge welling up from the depths of the abyss has finally receded,<br>
The legacy of [[Khaenri'ah|Dahri]], too, has submitted to the law.<br>
A thousand songs were sung in unison, and the heavy rains abated for a time.

O Nagarjuna,<br>
If the [[The Withering|dark tide]] reappears and the black abyss returns,<br>
Sing this hymn and offer prayers to the Khvarena unassailable.<br>
May the eternal Khvarena guide us on the upward path.
