{{Description|On the streets of Fontaine's [[Quartier Lyonnais]], you and Paimon encounter a strange engineer. She is currently researching the profound subject of "Graph Adversarial Technology," and urgently requires the help of Adventurers...}}
'''Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 4.2]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2023/11/17 10:00 - 2023/11/27 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]]"

===Summary===
* The first six days of the event is the photo-taking phase. During this phase, use the film to take photos of designated subjects and obtain "samples." Samples can be exchanged for "Research Awards," which can be used to obtain [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], and other rewards.
* Any unused film will be cleared at the end of each day.
* The photo-taking phase consists of the first six days of the event. There will be a different photo subject assigned on each day of the photo-taking phase, namely, 6 subjects in total.
* During the photo-taking phase, when photographing the subject with the [[Image Sampling Kamera]], you can randomly obtain a "sample" with different characteristics (the colors of the samples and photography subjects are unrelated). You have 10 sheets of film each day with which to take photos, and any unused film will be cleared at the end of each day.
* Each time you collect all 5 characteristic samples, visit [[Lepine-Pauline]] to exchange them for "Research Awards" and claim the rewards within. Up to 7 Research Awards can be exchanged for during the event.
* During the event, you can exchange samples with your [[friend]]s.
* After the photo-taking phase ends, you will no longer be able to obtain samples through photographing. You can still exchange samples with your friends and exchange your collected samples for Research Awards during the event.
