{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maile:''' Hey there, friend! You free for a chat?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, hit me with it.
::'''Maile:''' Haha, that was quick! I like your style.
::'''Maile:''' That said, I don't actually have much to talk about... *sigh* You know, the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] come and go like the mist. I knew this would happen, even before coming over to see her.
:;({{cx}})
:::'''Maile:''' You know, I was worried at first that she might've been injured during the [[Abyss]] incursion, so I asked around. Turns out that she just took a few bumps!
::'''Maile:''' I learned a new instrument recently, and wanted to play it for her. If I spent all the time I've been waiting for her practicing, I'd definitely be on the road to becoming a master!
::'''Maile:''' But playing the same tunes over and over is pretty boring. Maybe I should become a graffiti apprentice somewhere close by...
::'''Maile:''' Ah, my apologies. I've let myself get a bit carried away... You should get back to your business.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It's fine.
:::'''Maile:''' Haha, you're the patient sort, huh? Good. That kinda temperament will make you lots of friends.
:::'''Maile:''' And that's great! Life's all about spending time with friends to share our joys and delicious food!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Delicious BBQ Beef Heart Skewers|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I've other things to attend to.
::'''Maile:''' Ah, go ahead then. Don't let me take up your time.
